[8083] Samsara name-only repeat—life that, light liberated particular entered.
[8084] From Thal-'gyur:
[8085] */ This self-object shown from,
[8086] */ Circumstantial-conditions entering not.
[8087] */ Zang-ma and thal-byung,
[8088] */ Object awareness appearance aspect from,
[8089] */ Straight self basis from liberated.
[8090] Thus.
[8091] Well: khregs-chod manifested also, appearance measure not-reached, aggregates liberated shown—particular what? Very great: khregs-chod by manifested also, atom part-not from, light go not-possible. Light gone-not, vajra-body not-established. Occasional illusion-body, final not-decide. Light-body not-attained, transference great body not-attained—other benefit vast, support that not-accomplish because. Light atom dissolve portion from: transference great benefit not-do, clairvoyance and miracle accomplish, vast small particular existing.
[8092] Second: rig-pa ye-from luminosity spoken, that khregs-chod by empty measure, self-light not-see that. Thod-rgal by essence-held, dharmata essence luminosity inside captured time, dharma-possessing self-resound luminosity outside appearance technique shown existing—transcended.
[8093] From Rang-shar:
[8094] */ Self-appearance rig-pa's king this,
[8095] */ All existing, realization not.
[8096] Thus.
[8097] Third: rig-pa's ye-she khregs-chod see-not, cover addition, see not one decide that. Thod-rgal ye-she's sight open, dharmata's sun-rays clear.
[8098] From Thal-'gyur:
[8099] */ Dharmata direct appearance by,
[8100] */ Intellect grasping view suppressed.
[8101] Thus.
[8102] Fourth: khregs-chod coarse nerve-wind dependent, thod-rgal light-nerve clear recognized, lamp actual path made.
[8103] That from:
[8104] */ Also nerve delusion-mandala by,
[8105] */ Nature appearance ye-she five,
[8106] */ Bubble eye see.
[8107] Thus.

[8126] Khregs-chod: faculties six's gate not-pure, mind's dharma clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: pure luminosity's gate, ye-she's wind moved, lamp four's appearance arise—transcended.
[8127] That from:
[8128] */ Gate how arisen is,
[8129] */ Entering wind moved by.
[8130] */ Lamp four, actions four arisen.
[8131] Thus.
[8132] Sixth: khregs-chod see-not, rig-pa self-clear faculty clear-seek from. Thod-rgal: outer-inner ye-she zang-thal faculty, expanse and ye-she gather-separate not appearance, direct examine particular entered.
[8133] From Thal-'gyur:
[8134] */ Pure expanse lamp to,
[8135] */ Thig-le body delusion-appearance pure,
[8136] */ Nature itself, essence itself,
[8137] */ Non-dual gather-separate not appear.
[8138] Thus.
[8139] Seventh: khregs-chod outer-object, inner-mind's delusion-appearance appear made, abandon-accept not condition addition, quick those liberation-not itself. Thod-rgal: essence-held moment from, outer-inner delusion-appearance, delusion-grasper with self-dissolved. Not-abandoned place pure, addition not-dependent. Ye-she's increase-appearance, moon waxing upward increase. Appearance four measure reached, quick liberated itself.
[8140] That from:
[8141] */ Appear manner delusion not,
[8142] */ Cause-conditions pure nature to.
[8143] */ Entity entity-not self-pure from,
[8144] */ Gates-five's object-attachment pure.
[8145] */ Elements coarse pure,
[8146] */ Ye-she pure increase-appearance show.
[8147] */ That exhausted dharmata.
[8148] Thus.
[8149] These particular: subtle distinguish thought beyond also, outline only spoken. Briefly: rig-pa's meaning direct seeing, see existing, delusion moment reverse. Intellect dependent delusion-appearance, path made not-deluded result seek—particular great, wisdom-eye possessing realize.
[8150] Dharma this: essence such existing, all's peak supreme called.

[8165] [8165-8167]
[8166] The wheel of dharmatā's three crucial points,
[8167] The wheel of day-night luminosity,
[8168] The vast wheel of face-expanse wisdom—
[8169] Thus the three wheels turn.
[8170] [8168-8173]
[8171] Four divisions present the first:
[8172] Body's three settling points,
[8173] Gate's three seeing points,
[8174] Expanse's three guiding points,
[8175] Object's three appearance points.
[8176] [8174-8176]
[8177] First: Body's posture, whichever three held,
[8178] Stomach relaxed, nerve-wind ease abiding—
[8179] This purpose exists.
[8180] If deliberately held, wind wrong, spread arise,
[8181] Nerve twist tight—the cause.
[8182] [8177-8184]
[8183] Gaze held, wind essence very slow,
[8184] From outer held, nose drawn—
[8185] This particular dharma, great gathering.
[8186] Common method: nose out-inhale,
[8187] Wheel four's inside filled,
[8188] Mind clear-clear, meditation produced.
[8189] Wind wrong, spread, coil, dull—
[8190] Four obstacles arise,
[8191] Delusion-appearance not appearing.
[8192] Here: wind purified, increase path not made.
[8193] 
[8194] 


### PAGE 193

[8195] Wind gather obstacle mind unhappy, affliction thought movement, heart ache—all clear. Time those fierce throw, essence supreme.
[8196] That-also: wind essence this not-know, cultivate appearance increase, sign measure arise—definitely not-become.
[8197] Second: seeing gate essence three. Gaze three whichever doing, effort held not, stomach relaxed self-arrive made. Eye not-move, gaze held essence that.
[8198] From Thal-'gyur:
[8199] */ Distant-settled move not essence,
[8200] */ This time gaze three apply.
[8201] Thus.
[8202] Third: guiding expanse essence three. Eye slow corner up-down, expanse appearance limit, eye not-move, recognition movement-not, awareness clear-empty piece piece settle—essence.
[8203] That from:
[8204] */ Expanse essence guiding is.
[8205] Thus.
[8206] From Rtsal-rdzogs:
[8207] */ Dharmata mindfulness dissipated sky to,
[8208] */ Clouds-five appear, golden garuda soar.
[8209] */ Grasping-attachment concept-extreme apart, condition coo.
[8210] */ Self-appearance direction-fall-not sky to,
[8211] */ Empty-luminosity elaboration apart garuda soar.
[8212] */ Appearance grasping not, condition coo.
[8213] */ Sign elaboration apart sky to,
[8214] */ Grasping-grasped apart dharmakaya garuda soar.
[8215] */ Dharmata self-appearance thig-le, condition coo.
[8216] Thus.
[8217] Fourth: outer object sky cloud dissolve gaze, rig-pa clear-dissolved portion, appearance increase quick. Inner object expanse lamp gaze, luminosity mother-child connect. Secret object rig-pa self-clear gaze, ka-dag dharmas exhausted dgongs-pa, self-place clear essence existing.
[8218] From Rang-shar:
[8219] */ Sky empty mandala in,
[8220] */ Unaltered lamp forms four,
[8221] */ Not-ceased meaning clear.
[8222] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp is,
[8223] */ Sky empty expanse-center in.
[8224] */ Expanse nature light body,
[8225] */ Not-ceased cease-not clear.
[8226] */ Ye-she five heart body,
[8227] */ Knot manner arise.
[8228] */ That also: go and come,
[8229] */ Move and flicker.
[8230] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp to,
[8231] */ Placed rig-pa not-move if,
[8232] */ Changeless realization excellent explained.
[8233] */ Wisdom self-occurred lamp is,
[8234] */ Superimposition all cut.
[8235] */ Thig-le empty lamp is,
[8236] */ Effort not shine become if,
[8237] */ Distant-ropes water lamp by,
[8238] */ That gaze not-distracted if,
[8239] */ Complete meditation measure spoken.
[8240] Thus.
[8241] 
[8242] 
[8243] 
[8244] 
[8245] 
[8246] 
[8247] 
[8248] 
[8249] 
[8250] 


### PAGE 194

[8251] From Thal-'gyur:
[8252] */ This object essence such:
[8253] */ Cloud apart outer object empty to,
[8254] */ Yogin sky bird-path abides.
[8255] */ This not-apart dharmata.
[8256] Thus.
[8257] Also: object appearance characteristic. Sky blue-green limit-not, light color form and, ye-she five self-appearance show.
[8258] To pure expanse lamp:
[8259] */ Thig-le body delusion-appearance pure,
[8260] */ Nature itself, essence itself,
[8261] */ Non-dual gather-separate not appear.
[8262] Thus.
[8263] This's time: nerve inside wind movement, thought subtle sha-ra-ra arise also, direct meaning harm not. Thought that itself, self self-hold not-possible, liberated clear-clear go—bird fledgling held fly like. Yal object emanate also, previous knot one one continuous, spread distraction that like not. Karma habitual-patterns not-accumulate, luminosity meditation not-destroy, rig-pa's rtsal manifest make, wisdom thol-byung arise open.
[8264] That also: gaze held effort, thought great self-cease. Great small subtle all, rang-grol gone is.
[8265] From Thal-'gyur:
[8266] */ Dgongs-pa one from move not,
[8267] */ Appearance appearance's thog clear.
[8268] */ Face mirror like from,
[8269] */ Liberated that, that itself liberated.
[8270] */ Awareness movement empty-yal,
[8271] */ Seeing-awareness rig-pa different not.
[8272] */ That itself self's thog liberated,
[8273] */ One knowing all liberated because.
[8274] */ Two three's number extreme exhausted,
[8275] */ Concept grasping object not-appear.
[8276] */ Movement grasping ye-from empty,
[8277] */ Empty dgongs-pa clear perfected.
[8278] */ Many's number extreme exhausted.
[8279] Thus.
[8280] This's time: view-meditation conduct three, dgongs-pa expanse-one gather.
[8281] From Rdo-rje-sems-dpa' heart mirror:
[8282] */ Extreme-cut direction-fall not, view measure possess.
[8283] */ Clear concept not, meditation measure possess.
[8284] */ Self-occurred altered not, conduct measure possess.
[8285] */ Great-bliss outflows not, enlightenment entity-not this.
[8286] */ Grasp not-get, water-moon like.
[8287] */ Desire-all self-occurred, rich treasure like.
[8288] Thus.
[8289] That-also: expanse-awareness appearance not-arise, eye corner equal gaze...

[8291] 
[8292] 
[8293] 
[8294] 
[8295] 
[8296]

[8298] 
[8299] 
[8300] 
[8301] 
[8302] 


### PAGE 195

[8303] In viewing, the essential point is to gaze unmoving at the midst of the sky's expanse, like unto a waterfall's cascade. And thus, from the letterless state:
[8304] */ Rig-pa resting in equipoise—this upadesa itself,
[8305] */ This the secret thig-le of enlightened intent.
[8306] */ The eyes held steadfast in absorption,
[8307] */ And thus examined apart from gathering and dispersal.
[8308] */ From the very corner of the eyes the expanse emerges,
[8309] */ Light subtle and swirling arises.
[8310] */ Its nature: lu-gu-rgyud itself,
[8311] */ Subtle, flickering, and mobile.
[8312] */ The eyes examined as the element of space,
[8313] */ The thig-le of the Buddha-body dawns.
[8314] */ Attaining the warmth of that very dgongs-pa,
[8315] */ Rig-pa's body—lu-gu-rgyud itself—
[8316] */ Together with the body, appearance dawns.
[8317] Thus.
[8318] Furthermore, at this juncture, establishing the three points of luminosity: the manner of mind's obscurations being purified in the dgongs-pa of essence; the manner of resting evenly unmoving in the state; and from that, the manner of signs, measures, and definitive time dawning. Of these three, the first has three aspects: the dgongs-pa of essence itself; the metaphor demonstrating mind and habitual patterns; and the essential summary of the manner of separation from these.
[8319] Of the first, from the Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind:
[8320] */ In the unmoving sky, rig-pa clear like unto it,
[8321] */ Clear yet unwavering—depth unfathomable.
[8322] */ Empty-luminosity, vast and open, in the great bliss expanse I wander,
[8323] */ Single-pointed clarity in the state of dharmata expanse.
[8324] */ Unmixed and perfected, established in spontaneous presence.
[8325] Thus.
[8326] The nature of rig-pa, wherein the four wisdoms self-manifest as one's own rtsal, demonstrates the natural state of superior seeing. The four wisdoms, from Rang shar:
[8327] Furthermore, regarding the nature of rig-pa:
[8328] */ The fourfold wisdom it possesses,
[8329] */ These four wisdoms are thus:
[8330] */ The liberating wisdom—
[8331] */ Liberates all completely.
[8332] */ Liberates into the pure field of kleshas,
[8333] */ Liberates into the state free from concept and birth,
[8334] */ Liberates into the expanse of rig-pa from non-recognition,
[8335] */ Liberates conceptual wisdom into the state.
[8336] */ Therefore, the liberating wisdom.
[8337] */ The activating wisdom—
[8338] */ Activates the five bodies into pure expanse,
[8339] */ Activates the five lights into non-grasping expanse,
[8340] */ Activates rig-pa ye-shes into expanse,
[8341] */ Activates the lamp into space-expanse.
[8342] */ Therefore, the activating wisdom.
[8343] */ The gathering wisdom—
[8344] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8345] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8346] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8347] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8348] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom—
[8349] */ Gathers elements into the five lights,
[8350] */ Gathers space into the lamp,
[8351] */ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
[8352] */ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
[8353] */ Therefore, the gathering wisdom.
[8354] */ The discriminating wisdom—
[8355] */ Discriminates non-recognition and rig-pa as two,
[8356] */ Discriminates kleshas and ye-shes as two,
[8357] */ Discriminates pure and impure as two,
[8358] */ Discriminates samsara and nirvana as two,
[8359] */ Discriminates realization and non-realization as two,
[8360] */ Discriminates good and bad as two.
[8361] */ Therefore, the discriminating wisdom.
[8362] Thus.
[8363] Furthermore, the second: through the purification at that very time of mind and habitual patterns—the objects to be purified by dgongs-pa...
[8364] 
[8365] 
[8366] 
[8367] 
[8368]

[8370] 
[8371] 
[8372] 
[8373] 
[8374] 


### PAGE 196

[8375] The metaphor for this is:
[8376] From the mirror of Vajrasattva's heart:
[8377] "A ho! Listen, Vajra holder!
[8378] Unripened conceptual samsara
[8379] Is like a corpse on a gibbet with irons inserted—
[8380] Without liberation, the time of liberation does not arise.
[8381] With the irons of ignorance inserted, one cannot become liberated.
[8382] Ignorance is like water—it gathers afflictions.
[8383] The fire of aversion is like a mass of fire at the end of an eon.
[8384] Attachment to entities is like drinking salt water.
[8385] Delusion's thickening is like darkness in an empty house.
[8386] Pride and arrogance are like overthrowing a mountain.
[8387] Jealousy and ill-will are like blindness in a narrow valley.
[8388] These five afflictions obscure wisdom.
[8389] The mind is like a thieving bitch.
[8390] Consciousness is like a forest monkey.
[8391] Mind is like impure mud and swamp.
[8392] The alaya is like a pig being.
[8393] Knowing is like a bird's feather carried by the wind.
[8394] Apprehending and grasping are like man and woman.
[8395] The distinction of karma is like a bird tangled in snares.
[8396] The distinction of suffering is like a whirlpool in water.
[8397] There is no method to endure the fruit of afflictions.
[8398] This fixated peg of apprehending and grasping, the suffering of samsara—
[8399] Through action one cannot exit; through release one becomes liberated.
[8400] Abandoning all done dharmas, easy accomplishment.
[8401] Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoving.
[8402] By the king of secret mantra, afflictions become wisdom.
[8403] Like raising a lamp in an empty house,
[8404] By the lamp of wisdom, ignorance becomes awareness.
[8405] Thus it is said.
[8406] Third, the summary of the way of separation from that has three parts:
[8407] The actual way of separation in one's own time through direct perception,
[8408] Establishing the proof of separation,
[8409] Speaking of other enumerations.
[8410] The first is:
[8411] By looking at the clear light of outer appearances,
[8412] Without delusion, when the meditation of inner self-tone is clear in its own place,
[8413] Mind and wisdom split instantly—the alaya with its eight collections is obscured by wisdom,
[8414] Samsara dharmas are not clear.


### PAGE 197

[8415] Spontaneously accomplished as one's own passed nature is—
[8416] From Samantabhadra's mind mirror:
[8417] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8418] Wisdom separated from intellect is actual intent,
[8419] Light rays separated from interior are actual pure appearance.
[8420] Thus it is said, and
[8421] From Self-Arising:
[8422] Awareness separated from mind is actual buddhahood,
[8423] I, Vajrasattva, separated from intellect,
[8424] Know without concept in clarifying appearance,
[8425] Concept-free discriminating awareness equality is
[8426] Great self-liberation through itself.
[8427] Thus it is said.
[8428] Second, the proof is:
[8429] By placing unmoved in the nature of appearance, samsara dharmas go to self-awakening—like sediment self-awakening through unmoved water.
[8430] Showing intent difficult to measure in depth through the metaphor of a jewel in clear water—
[8431] From the previous:
[8432] This drop of self-arising nectar,
[8433] Like a jewel in clear water,
[8434] When possessing sediment is placed, the sediment clears.
[8435] Thus this heart pith instruction,
[8436] When applied, afflictions do not become stains.
[8437] Thus and:
[8438] Single and alone, easily appearing as companion,
[8439] In the unborn expanse, clear light wisdom,
[8440] Exists in all, yet seen by none.
[8441] Like the sky's expanse, immeasurable by measure,
[8442] Like the sun's light, clear and shining,
[8443] Like Mount Meru, king of mountains, unchanging,
[8444] Like the ocean's depth, deep and difficult to measure,
[8445] Like the lotus of mud, without stain,
[8446] Like the moon in water, without face-grasping,
[8447] Like the sky's miracle, appearing as whatever,
[8448] Like the rainbow, clear and complete.
[8449] Thus it is said.
[8450] Third, speaking of other enumerations is:
[8451] All intent such as expanse and awareness dissolving into the single expanse of root awareness, cutting and deciding—
[8452] Again from that same source:
[8453] Deliver all meaning into the expanse without arising,
[8454] Make recognize the lamp of the enlightenment path,
[8455] Gather all dharmas into the nature separated from speech,
[8456] Deliver all tantras into the great tantra without letters, the great tantra of one's own awareness.


### PAGE 198

[8457] Deliver all scriptures into the great root scripture without showing.
[8458] Deliver all oral instructions separated from the basis of speech.
[8459] Deliver all accomplishments separated from actor and acted.
[8460] Deliver all conduct into the great supreme unfabricated.
[8461] Deliver all meditations into the great clear without grasping.
[8462] Deliver all views wide open, not attached to anything.
[8463] Deliver all fruits into the great wisdom of single cut.
[8464] Gather all those into a single expanse of non-abiding.
[8465] Release all actions of samsara.
[8466] Constantly familiarize with the appearance of wisdom.
[8467] Recognize the time when wisdom arises.
[8468] Know all basis dharmas as essence, nature, and compassion—three.
[8469] Know all path dharmas as five kayas and five wisdoms.
[8470] Know all fruit dharmas as three kayas without returning.
[8471] Know all essence dharmas as empty.
[8472] Know all nature dharmas as clear.
[8473] Know all compassion dharmas as pervading all beings.
[8474] Know all wisdom dharmas as unmixed.
[8475] Know all light dharmas as without grasping.
[8476] Know all ray dharmas as without emanating or gathering.
[8477] Know all awareness dharmas as separated from self-concept.
[8478] Thus deliver all dharmas without conceptualizing or thinking anything.
[8479] Second, regarding the way of placing unmoved and equal in the nature, from two:
[8480] The brief presentation of placing in the nature of essence is:
[8481] From Thal 'gyur:
[8482] The characteristic of meditation, the way of appearing:
[8483] The characteristic of empty-clear awareness,
[8484] Nature unmixed wherever,
[8485] Apprehending and grasping extremes exhausted,
[8486] Dharmata's own face pure.
[8487] Thus it is said.
[8488] The extensive explanation of placing in the appearance of nature is:
[8489] From Six Expanses:
[8490] Direct the nose toward the three passed kayas.


### PAGE 199

[8491] Supporting the back toward the three kayas of the future,
[8492] Enjoying the three kayas of the present
[8493] Is making manifest the fruit of the buddhas,
[8494] Called abiding primordially in the equality of the three times.
[8495] Making the five wisdoms of the past the basis,
[8496] Directing the peak toward the five wisdoms of the future,
[8497] Making the five wisdoms of the present the path
[8498] Is called gathering the clear light of clarity,
[8499] The yoga of awareness in the equality of the three times.
[8500] Having confidence in the past awareness,
[8501] Holding the measure of the future awareness,
[8502] Making the present awareness the path
[8503] Is called the mother holding the son,
[8504] The yoga of awareness in the equality of the three times.
[8505] Holding the portion of the past thigle,
[8506] Directing the mind toward the future thigle,
[8507] Gathering the present thigles into one
[8508] Is called cutting the single unique root,
[8509] Called the yoga practitioner gathered in the equality of the three times.
[8510] Joining with the gap of the past expanse,
[8511] Expanding with the expanse of the future,
[8512] Abiding in one ground with the present expanse
[8513] Is called awareness entering the expanse,
[8514] Called abiding primordially connected in the equality of the three times.
[8515] Directing the nose toward the lamps of the past,
[8516] Holding in hand the lamp of the future,
[8517] Striking clarity upon the present lamps
[8518] Is the view of the self-pure lamp of the empty dhatu,
[8519] Appearance primordially in the equality of the three times.
[8520] Giving the path to the lights of the past,
[8521] Placing the mind upon the lights of the future,
[8522] Lowering the mind upon the present lights
[8523] Is called self-confidence reaching all appearances,
[8524] Primordially without gathering or separating in the equality of the three times.
[8525] Third, from that, the way signs, measures, and times certainly appear has three parts:
[8526] The signs of the three kayas of clear light,
[8527] The measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi,
[8528] The time of unmoved equal placement.
[8529] The first is:
[8530] Again from that same source:

[8531] By direct placement in the first samadhi,
[8532] Through gradual familiarity with the three kayas,
[8533] In the yoga of the nature of entities,
[8534] This meaning becomes supremely near.
[8535] The samadhi experience of familiarity with the three kayas
[8536] Is not instantaneous arising—
[8537] All this is the gradual object of mind.
[8538] First, obtaining the nirmanakaya samadhi:
[8539] At that time, in one's own knowing,
[8540] All dharmas not seen before
[8541] Appear in the mind without thought.
[8542] The words of one's own pith instruction terms
[8543] Clear in the mind without being held.
[8544] For the person possessing good fortune,
[8545] The mind expanding by the taste of dharma,
[8546] For six or seven days the body
[8547] Does not feel what exists,
[8548] Rising above the earth,
[8549] The experience of going in mid-space
[8550] Arises as one's own activity field.
[8551] When awareness unfabricated is placed in the castle,
[8552] One obtains the nirmanakaya thus.
[8553] Passed that, by awareness unmoving,
[8554] The sambhogakaya itself also
[8555] In the continuum of one's own knowing,
[8556] Without all effort in self-appearance,
[8557] Arises thus as experienced taste.
[8558] Also the light appearances not seen before,
[8559] Who sees piece by piece—
[8560] This too trains toward the sambhogakaya.
[8561] For that yogi possessing fortune and family,
[8562] Each experience of self-clear knowing clears,
[8563] By familiarity with self-clear mind,
[8564] The inner clear, mind moving, is not cast outward,
[8565] Mind does not follow the traces of entities,
[8566] Worldly actions do not appear to mind.
[8567] By this one obtains the complete sambhogakaya.
[8568] Then, awareness in the sky,
[8569] By the view manner of great direct placement,
[8570] By equal placement without distraction,
[8571] Again the dharmakaya samadhi appears.
[8572] At that time, knowing clears from the depths,
[8573] Directly engaging like an infant,
[8574] This is the measure of increasing appearance.
[8575] By sharp and quick knowing,
[8576] One sees buddhas not seen before.
[8577] By this, at that time, people—
[8578] Hundreds of thousands of myriads appear to mind,
[8579] Crafts without knowing that the body's
[8580] Previous not-made actions,
[8581] All miracles and letters,
[8582] Signs, speech, and dependent arising,
[8583] Whatever was not seen before—
[8584] All this is experienced as taste,
[8585] Earth, water, fire, and wind.

[8586] Through this, sound too attains autonomy.
[8587] Summarily, the six clairvoyances as well
[8588] This fortunate one obtains,
[8589] And benefits both self and others—
[8590] This person shall accomplish.
[8591] Thus it is spoken.
[8592] Second, the measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi:
[8593] From that very source:
[8594] The intention of the three self-arisen bodies
[8595] Is summarily found as experience-measures thus.
[8596] The yoga conduct of emanation-body—
[8597] Formerly nonexistent great compassion
[8598] Arises supreme within one's continuum.
[8599] At this time, emanation-body samadhi is obtained.
[8600] The experience of clear yet non-conceptual cognition
[8601] Is called enjoyment-body samadhi.
[8602] The uncontaminated emptiness bindu-body,
[8603] When self-arising without effort—
[8604] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8605] This endowed yogin obtains.
[8606] Thus it is spoken.
[8607] Second, the measure of spontaneously perfect samadhi:
[8608] Again from that same source:
[8609] The self-arisen intention of the three bodies
[8610] Is found in summary as measures of experience thus.
[8611] Practicing the yoga of emanation-body,
[8612] Great compassion previously nonexistent
[8613] Arises supreme within one's own continuum.
[8614] At this time, the samadhi of emanation-body is obtained.
[8615] The experience of clear non-conceptual knowing
[8616] Is called the samadhi of enjoyment-body.
[8617] The bindu-body of uncontaminated emptiness,
[8618] When self-arising without effort—
[8619] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8620] This yogin endowed obtains.
[8621] Thus it is spoken.
[8622] Third, the time of immovable equipoise has two aspects:
[8623] The time when luminosity appears manifestly,
[8624] And the time when instructions strike the arising-place.
[8625] First:
[8626] From that same source:
[8627] When all appearances become self-powered,
[8628] When awareness is demonstrated manifestly,
[8629] This is called the time of true-seeing intention.
[8630] When all appearances arise in self-direction,
[8631] When experience-seed increases,  [8617] This is called the time when awareness reaches balance.  [8618] When the power of arising persons ceases,  [8619] When cognition looks inward,  [8620] This is the time of striking awareness's arising-place.  [8621] When Dharma-nature, free from conditions, causes all appearances to spread wide in bliss,  [8622] This is called the time of mother-son Dharma-nature equality.  [8623] When the true light-rays of all Buddhas fill and expand one's body,  [8624] When body manifests enlightenment,  [8625] This is called the time of obtaining self-stability.  [8626] Thus it is spoken.  [8627] Second, the time of striking the instruction arising-place:  [8628] From Self-Arising:  [8629] When cognition-awareness arises in the continuum,  [8630] Recognize the face of body.  [8631] When realization arises in the continuum, recognize the face of awareness's field.


### PAGE 202

[8632] When samadhi becomes power, recognize the lamp's face of complete purity.
[8633] When special power arises,
[8634] Recognize the spreading of samadhi's path.
[8635] When seeing the body of awareness, know without desiring mind.
[8636] When special wisdom arises in the continuum, recognize demonic deception.
[8637] When difficulty-free conduct overflows the expanse,
[8638] Recognize wisdom's direction of entry.
[8639] When emptiness pervades the field, recognize light.
[8640] When lamp appears in the field,
[8641] Recognize space and field.
[8642] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8643] When appearance comes piece by piece,
[8644] The expert must thoroughly examine.
[8645] When extremely subtle and flickering,
[8646] Through familiarity, thoroughly settle.
[8647] When fluttering, subtle, and flickering,
[8648] Through seeing, thoroughly hold.
[8649] When round, subtle, and coiling,
[8650] The expert steadies samadhi without distraction.
[8651] When sinking, blazing, and hurling appear,
[8652] Through familiarity, hold the expanding appearance.
[8653] When truly appearing in every way,
[8654] The expert explains the gathering of appearance.
[8655] When without attachment and fixation,
[8656] The expert must know the method of holding.
[8657] This is the characteristic of secret mantra familiarity.
[8658] Thus it is spoken.
[8659] Second, the day-night luminosity wheel has three aspects:
[8660] Recognizing the space-luminosity arising-base,
[8661] Demonstrating lamp-experience from that,
[8662] Determining the day-night wheel manner of meditation.
[8663] First:
[8664] Although explained formerly,
[8665] Here it is thoroughly condensed, five clear demonstrations:
[8666] The manner of space,
[8667] The manner of lamp's location,
[8668] The manner of space-awareness arising,
[8669] The manner of taking experience,
[8670] The manner of special determination.
[8671] First:
[8672] The space-luminosity bliss-gone heart essence abides without difference in all sentient beings.
[8673] From Jewel Variegated:
[8674] Like butter spontaneously present within sesame or mustard seed,
[8675] Within sentient beings appearing as bodies,
[8676] The thus-gone seed
[8677] Abides with compatible light as self-nature.
[8678] 


### PAGE 203

[8679] From that abiding, through pure doors of entering the path,
[8680] Emerge variously and conduct benefit.
[8681] Sentient beings pervade like the sky—
[8682] The meaning of awareness is also just thus.
[8683] Thus it is spoken.
[8684] Where does it exist?
[8685] From that same source:
[8686] Ah! The location-condition of awareness
[8687] Abides within one's own heart center.
[8688] Holding the portions of father-mother two,
[8689] It abides as method and wisdom.
[8690] Holding the father's portion, method-body,
[8691] Holding the mother's, wisdom-body,
[8692] It abides as light and light-ray.
[8693] Thoroughly adorned by space and awareness,
[8694] It abides as spontaneously complete great bindu.
[8695] Thus it is spoken.
[8696] How do body and wisdom abide within awareness's expanse of light?
[8697] What are the determined locations?
[8698] From Power-Perfect:
[8699] Within each self, citta jewel,
[8700] Color-filled light blazes, vase-manner,
[8701] Within, wisdom-fire light blazes,
[8702] Measureless wisdoms many appear.
[8703] Upon each body essence,
[8704] Speech emanations numberless,
[8705] Mind intention unsurpassable, one.
[8706] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8707] The all-ground great dharma-arising treasure,
[8708] Awareness wisdom abides as mound,
[8709] Appearance hold-without, field-treasure,
[8710] Awareness wisdom abides in space.
[8711] Secret-assembly jewel eight-cornered treasure,
[8712] Awareness wisdom abides as mound,
[8713] Appearance hold-without, field-treasure,
[8714] Awareness wisdom abides in space.
[8715] Secret-assembly jewel eight-cornered treasure,
[8716] Awareness wisdom father-mother manner,
[8717] Life-assembly jewel four-cornered treasure,
[8718] Awareness wisdom abides in bindu,
[8719] Meaning-coil bandha measureless treasure,
[8720] Awareness wisdom abides as wrathful-body,
[8721] Cease-without clear two-door treasure,
[8722] Space and nadi-thread abide.
[8723] Emptiness sign-free sky treasure,
[8724] Awareness wisdom abides as light—
[8725] This is demonstrated as the secret treasure.
[8726] Thus it is spoken.
[8727] Moreover, that nature of awareness, base-heart location, abides within the five space-lights like a peacock egg.
[8728] When arising on the path-space, sky rainbow-light and


### PAGE 204

[8729] When reaching the end, like a fetus liberated from the eggshell.
[8730] From Power-Perfect:
[8731] The awareness abiding in the base
[8732] Perfects the three bodies in wisdom-space.
[8733] Like a peacock egg,
[8734] Within, light-wisdom clearly demonstrated.
[8735] The awareness arising on the path
[8736] Is demonstrated like a rainbow.
[8737] The awareness delivering to the end
[8738] Is like peacock chicks
[8739] Breaking through and emerging.
[8740] Thus it is spoken.
[8741] Moreover, when wisdom is unripe, all open;
[8742] At the time of appearance, light;
[8743] At the time of familiarity, body-appearance.
[8744] From that:
[8745] From the space without elaboration,
[8746] Unobstructed luminosity contact arises.
[8747] At the time of appearance, light appears;
[8748] At the time of perfection, self-appearance.
[8749] At the time of familiarity, becomes body.
[8750] By wisdom-method relation,
[8751] See the five ultimate mandalas.
[8752] Thus it is spoken.
[8753] The characteristics of thus-abiding body, awareness, space, and wisdom:
[8754] From that same source:
[8755] The characteristic of body is thus:
[8756] Unchanging, clear,
[8757] Empty, and free of concepts.
[8758] The characteristic of awareness is thus:
[8759] Subtle, emanating,
[8760] Nadi-thread, and moving.
[8761] The characteristic of space is thus:
[8762] Vast, spontaneously thick, infinitely empty,
[8763] Clear, warm, cool,
[8764] Holding the nature of flexibility and movement,
[8765] Pervading, rim-wall.
[8766] The characteristic of wisdom is thus:
[8767] Arising, arisen, self-clear,
[8768] From, knowing, and realizing.
[8769] Clear, blazing, infinitely pervading,
[8770] Appearing, dark, opening,
[8771] The supreme wisdom of emptiness-clear—
[8772] These are considered the characteristics of secret mantra.
[8773] Thus it is spoken.
[8774] Second, the manner of lamp's location:
[8775] For gods, one cubit.
[8776] For demigods, four fingers.
[8777] For humans, one color-point.
[8778] For animals, self-clear.
[8779] For pretas, like a sesame seed.
[8780] For hell-beings, like a horse-hoof.
[8781] For Buddhas, immeasurable.


### PAGE 205

[8782] Bodhicitta, one arrow;
[8783] For emanation-body, one fathom.
[8784] The existence of self-light wisdom-appearance
[8785] From that same source:
[8786] Wisdom locations, large and small,
[8787] From the six directions of appearance
[8788] Are thoroughly explained thus:
[8789] For those in Joyful, one cubit abides.
[8790] For those in Strife, four fingers abide.
[8791] For those with equal, one color-point.
[8792] For those with two, only self-clear.
[8793] For those with hunger, like sesame seed.
[8794] For those with suffering, like horse-hoof.
[8795] Thus it is explained they abide.
[8796] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
[8797] For Bodhisattvas, one arrow.
[8798] For emanation-bodies, one fathom abides.
[8799] For Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,
[8800] And emanation-bodies and gods,
[8801] They appear in manifest fields.
[8802] Below those, in five fields,
[8803] Undemonstrated, they are not seen.
[8804] Thus it is spoken.
[8805] Moreover, the great lamp-appearance of Buddha, Bodhisattva, and god triad self-appearing in intermediate space is due to vast fields; the other five are small because they are fields of one's own body.
[8806] 
[8807] Third, the arising manner of space-awareness has two aspects:
[8808] Space is the outer field-pervasion of great blue light, the self-glow of five lights existing within as five wisdoms; from that expanding, five-possessed great wisdom light two self-arise as field-appearance.
[8809] 
[8810] Awareness is the appearance of vajra nadi-thread with portion-body.
[8811] From Power-Perfect:
[8812] The view-essence of all Buddhas
[8813] Does not surpass space-awareness two.
[8814] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8815] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8816] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8817] To self-arisen space-lamp,
[8818] Self-appear light is unthinkable.
[8819] To bindu-empty lamp,
[8820] Ray-possessed bindu is unthinkable.
[8821] To the essence of five wisdoms,
[8822] Demonstrating words are unthinkable.
[8823] To condition-free field-appearance,
[8824] Cease-free arising is unthinkable.
[8825] Thus it is spoken.
[8826] Fourth, the manner of taking experience has two aspects:


### PAGE 206

[8827] Constriction by essential point, and
[8828] The experience-appearance arising from that.
[8829] First, also general placing-method, and
[8830] Particular essential-method, two:
