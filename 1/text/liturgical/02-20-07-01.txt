[9079] From the first pure red,
[9080] Perfect empowerment, round, complete self-clear.
[9081] From two pure fingers, becomes three.
[9082] Then by pressing again and again,
[9083] The colors of the five wisdoms—
[9084] White, red, green, blue, and yellow—
[9085] Appear in the field through effort.
[9086] Then also outer, without effort,
[9087] Going and coming by wind's portion,
[9088] From mirror-pure shapes,
[9089] Appear as portions of two and three.
[9090] From constant familiarity with that itself,
[9091] Also by the five-color light,
[9092] From mere slice, edge-cut appears,
[9093] See measure from mere field-edge.
[9094] From finding familiarity's measure from that,
[9095] With body to bindu center,
[9096] Abide while in pure half-body,
[9097] To that with five-five pairs,
[9098] Connect with very clear bindu,
[9099] Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[9100] Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.
[9101] Thus it is spoken.
[9102] At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.



[9103] Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[9104] Dharmatā pure appearance, awareness, and
[9105] Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[9106] Again conducting dharmatā cease-appearance.



<tantra> [9107] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [9108] Wisdom-perfect appearance and
<tantra> [9109] From dharmatā's first appearance,
<tantra> [9110] From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.
<tantra> [9111] Thus it is spoken.



<tantra> [9112] At this time, body-speech-mind measures.
<tantra> [9113] When seeing individual appearances,
<tantra> [9114] Signs complete by ripening in self,
<tantra> [9115] Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
<tantra> [9116] Thus it is spoken.



[9117] Thus by taking experience, those with supreme effort: three years.
[9118] Middle ones: five years.
[9119] Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[9120] Six days: seeing dharmatā cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.



<tantra> [9121] From that same source:
<tantra> [9122] By great and small effort in this,
<tantra> [9123] By days, months, and years,
<tantra> [9124] Certainly accomplish at individual times.
<tantra> [9125] From times without much moving,
<tantra> [9126] Reach individual measures.
<tantra> [9127] Thus it is spoken.



[9128] This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking.
[9129] Third: determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[9130] Gathering sense-faculties to the essential point of the continuum, closing memory's door.
[9131] Putting knowable objects in the vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly.
[9132] At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place.
[9133] Striking with vast appearance by day,
[9134] Suppressing all signs.
[9135] Though these were explained formerly,
[9136] Here also explained as thögal companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[9137] There is distinction slightly different from former.
[9138] Daytime, looking at the manifest by elephant-gaze,
[9139] Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[9140] Nighttime, placing cognition on the bindu-empty lamp.
[9141] When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion.
[9142] When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle. In the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.



[9143] As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[9144] Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[9145] At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[9146] Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.
[9147] Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[9148] The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within.
[9149] Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.



<tantra> [9150] From the Six Expanses:
<tantra> [9151] Pressing the bodily posture,
<tantra> [9152] Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
<tantra> [9153] Likewise, eyes to the space between,
<tantra> [9154] By elephant gaze
<tantra> [9155] Place in great spreading without memory.
<tantra> [9156] Thus cast awareness to sky.
<tantra> [9157] Without separating from this,
<tantra> [9158] The yogin who meditates continuously
<tantra> [9159] Expands appearances by day.
<tantra> [9160] At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,
<tantra> [9161] To hold the measure of four equal times,
<tantra> [9162] Gathering sense doors oneself,
<tantra> [9163] To the lamp of empty bindu,
<tantra> [9164] The endowed yogin places mind.
<tantra> [9165] When that bindu expands,
<tantra> [9166] Place consciousness expanding as well.
<tantra> [9167] When bindu becomes subtle,
<tantra> [9168] Bindu increasingly subtle,
<tantra> [9169] Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
<tantra> [9170] By essential point of sleep and dream,
<tantra> [9171] Extract root of former attachment habits.
<tantra> [9172] Thus in all times of night,
<tantra> [9173] The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
<tantra> [9174] By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
<tantra> [9175] Thus it is spoken.



[9176] Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[9177] Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.



<tantra> [9178] From that same source:
<tantra> [9179] By body, field, and awareness,
<tantra> [9180] Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.
<tantra> [9181] Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
<tantra> [9182] Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
<tantra> [9183] At the time of ceasing that,
<tantra> [9184] Awareness reaches the measure.
<tantra> [9185] When thus reaching the measure,
<tantra> [9186] One's own body also does not appear.
<tantra> [9187] The flesh-blood body produced by elements
<tantra> [9188] Because elements are pure in their own place,
<tantra> [9189] Because this appears as field,
<tantra> [9190] The mind-body grasped by delusion
<tantra> [9191] Because elements dissolve in their own place,
<tantra> [9192] This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
<tantra> [9193] The light-body grasped by awareness
<tantra> [9194] Is like the water-moon mandala.
<tantra> [9195] At this time, near dharmatā cessation,
<tantra> [9196] Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
<tantra> [9197] Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
<tantra> [9198] Obtain the action-free perfect body.
<tantra> [9199] At this time, all limits of body
<tantra> [9200] Are near to freedom.
<tantra> [9201] The yogin familiar with the base
<tantra> [9202] Also empties one's own place.
<tantra> [9203] The yogin familiar with the path
<tantra> [9204] Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
<tantra> [9205] Whoever is familiar with the fruit
<tantra> [9206] Reaches the non-return ground by this.
<tantra> [9207] Thus it is spoken.



[9208] Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samādhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye,



[9209] While the samādhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.
[9210] Third: extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:
[9211] Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[9212] Extensively explaining the nature,
[9213] Summarizing the meaning by aspect.
[9214] First:



<tantra> [9215] From the Lion Power-Perfect:
<tantra> [9216] Also, what are the five intentions?
<tantra> [9217] By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
<tantra> [9218] By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground.
<tantra> [9219] By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
<tantra> [9220] By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.
<tantra> [9221] By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.



[9222] Second, from five:
