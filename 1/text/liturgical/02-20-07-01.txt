00001| <prose> From the first pure red,</prose>
00002| <verse> Perfect empowerment, round, complete self-clear.</verse>
00003| <verse> From two pure fingers, becomes three.</verse>
00004| <verse> Then by pressing again and again,</verse>
00005| <verse> The colors of the five wisdoms—</verse>
00006| <verse> White, red, green, blue, and yellow—</verse>
00007| <verse> Appear in the field through effort.</verse>
00008| <verse> Then also outer, without effort,</verse>
00009| <verse> Going and coming by wind's portion,</verse>
00010| <verse> From mirror-pure shapes, || 10 ||</verse>
00011| <verse> Appear as portions of two and three.</verse>
00012| <verse> From constant familiarity with that itself,</verse>
00013| <verse> Also by the five-color light,</verse>
00014| <verse> From mere slice, edge-cut appears,</verse>
00015| <verse> See measure from mere field-edge.</verse>
00016| <verse> From finding familiarity's measure from that,</verse>
00017| <verse> With body to bindu center,</verse>
00018| <verse> Abide while in pure half-body,</verse>
00019| <verse> To that with five-five pairs,</verse>
00020| <verse> Connect with very clear bindu, || 20 ||</verse>
00021| <verse> Possessing father-mother body-appearance,</verse>
00022| <verse> Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.</verse>
00023| <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
00024| <prose> At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.</prose>
00025| <prose> Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and</prose>
00026| <prose> Dharmatā pure appearance, awareness, and</prose>
00027| <prose> Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,</prose>
00028| <prose> Again conducting dharmatā cease-appearance.</prose>
00029| <tantra> From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
00030| <verse> Wisdom-perfect appearance and || 30 ||</verse>
00031| <verse> From dharmatā's first appearance,</verse>
00032| <verse> From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.</verse>
00033| <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
00034| <verse> At this time, body-speech-mind measures.</verse>
00035| <verse> When seeing individual appearances,</verse>
00036| <verse> Signs complete by ripening in self,</verse>
00037| <verse> Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.</verse>
00038| <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
00039| <prose> Thus by taking experience, those with supreme effort: three years.</prose>
00040| <prose> Middle ones: five years. || 40 ||</prose>
00041| <prose> Last ones: seven years, eleven months,</prose>
00042| <prose> Six days: seeing dharmatā cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.</prose>
00043| <tantra> From that same source:</tantra>
00044| <verse> By great and small effort in this,</verse>
00045| <verse> By days, months, and years,</verse>
00046| <verse> Certainly accomplish at individual times.</verse>
00047| <verse> From times without much moving,</verse>
00048| <verse> Reach individual measures.</verse>
00049| <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
00050| <prose> This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking. || 50 ||</prose>
00051| <ornament> Third: determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:</ornament>
00052| <list> Gathering sense-faculties to the essential point of the continuum, closing memory's door.</list>
00053| <list> Putting knowable objects in the vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly.</list>
00054| <list> At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place.</list>
00055| <list> Striking with vast appearance by day,</list>
00056| <list> Suppressing all signs.</list>
00057| <prose> Though these were explained formerly,</prose>
00058| <prose> Here also explained as thögal companion, summarizing: taking experience,</prose>
00059| <prose> There is distinction slightly different from former.</prose>
00060| <prose> Daytime, looking at the manifest by elephant-gaze, || 60 ||</prose>
00061| <prose> Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.</prose>
00062| <prose> Nighttime, placing cognition on the bindu-empty lamp.</prose>
00063| <prose> When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion.</prose>
00064| <prose> When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle. In the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.</prose>
00065| <prose> As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,</prose>
00066| <prose> Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.</prose>
00067| <prose> At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,</prose>
00068| <prose> Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.</prose>
00069| <prose> Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,</prose>
00070| <prose> The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within. || 70 ||</prose>
00071| <prose> Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.</prose>
00072| <tantra> From the Six Expanses:</tantra>
00073| <verse> Pressing the bodily posture,</verse>
00074| <verse> Cast consciousness to the range of sky.</verse>
00075| <verse> Likewise, eyes to the space between,</verse>
00076| <verse> By elephant gaze</verse>
00077| <verse> Place in great spreading without memory.</verse>
00078| <verse> Thus cast awareness to sky.</verse>
00079| <verse> Without separating from this,</verse>
00080| <verse> The yogin who meditates continuously || 80 ||</verse>
00081| <verse> Expands appearances by day.</verse>
00082| <verse> At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,</verse>
00083| <verse> To hold the measure of four equal times,</verse>
00084| <verse> Gathering sense doors oneself,</verse>
00085| <verse> To the lamp of empty bindu,</verse>
00086| <verse> The endowed yogin places mind.</verse>
00087| <verse> When that bindu expands,</verse>
00088| <verse> Place consciousness expanding as well.</verse>
00089| <verse> When bindu becomes subtle,</verse>
00090| <verse> Bindu increasingly subtle, || 90 ||</verse>
00091| <verse> Place consciousness increasingly subtle.</verse>
00092| <verse> By essential point of sleep and dream,</verse>
00093| <verse> Extract root of former attachment habits.</verse>
00094| <verse> Thus in all times of night,</verse>
00095| <verse> The fortunate endowed yogin acts.</verse>
00096| <verse> By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.</verse>
00097| <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
00098| <prose> Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,</prose>
00099| <prose> Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.</prose>
00100| <tantra> From that same source: || 100 ||</tantra>
00101| <verse> By body, field, and awareness,</verse>
00102| <verse> Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.</verse>
00103| <verse> Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,</verse>
00104| <verse> Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.</verse>
00105| <verse> At the time of ceasing that,</verse>
00106| <verse> Awareness reaches the measure.</verse>
00107| <verse> When thus reaching the measure,</verse>
00108| <verse> One's own body also does not appear.</verse>
00109| <verse> The flesh-blood body produced by elements</verse>
00110| <verse> Because elements are pure in their own place, || 110 ||</verse>
00111| <verse> Because this appears as field,</verse>
00112| <verse> The mind-body grasped by delusion</verse>
00113| <verse> Because elements dissolve in their own place,</verse>
00114| <verse> This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.</verse>
00115| <verse> The light-body grasped by awareness</verse>
00116| <verse> Is like the water-moon mandala.</verse>
00117| <verse> At this time, near dharmatā cessation,</verse>
00118| <verse> Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.</verse>
00119| <verse> Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,</verse>
00120| <verse> Obtain the action-free perfect body. || 120 ||</verse>
00121| <verse> At this time, all limits of body</verse>
00122| <verse> Are near to freedom.</verse>
00123| <verse> The yogin familiar with the base</verse>
00124| <verse> Also empties one's own place.</verse>
00125| <verse> The yogin familiar with the path</verse>
00126| <verse> Exhausts coarse elemental stains.</verse>
00127| <verse> Whoever is familiar with the fruit</verse>
00128| <verse> Reaches the non-return ground by this.</verse>
00129| <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
00130| <prose> Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samādhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye, || 130 ||</prose>
00131| <prose> While the samādhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.</prose>
00132| <ornament> Third: extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:</ornament>
00133| <list> Briefly demonstrating the essence,</list>
00134| <list> Extensively explaining the nature,</list>
00135| <list> Summarizing the meaning by aspect.</list>
00136| <ornament> First:</ornament>
00137| <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:</tantra>
00138| <verse> Also, what are the five intentions?</verse>
00139| <verse> By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.</verse>
00140| <verse> By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground. || 140 ||</verse>
00141| <verse> By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.</verse>
00142| <verse> By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.</verse>
00143| <verse> By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.</verse>
00144| <ornament> Second, from five:</ornament>
