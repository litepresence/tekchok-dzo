[9079] From the first pure red,
[9080] Perfect empowerment, round, complete self-clear.
[9081] From two pure fingers, becomes three.
[9082] Then by pressing again and again,
[9083] The colors of the five wisdoms—
[9084] White, red, green, blue, and yellow—
[9085] Appear in the field through effort.
[9086] Then also outer, without effort,
[9087] Going and coming by wind's portion,
[9088] From mirror-pure shapes,
[9089] Appear as portions of two and three.
[9090] From constant familiarity with that itself,
[9091] Also by the five-color light,
[9092] From mere slice, edge-cut appears,
[9093] See measure from mere field-edge.
[9094] From finding familiarity's measure from that,
[9095] With body to bindu center,
[9096] Abide while in pure half-body,
[9097] To that with five-five pairs,
[9098] Connect with very clear bindu,
[9099] Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[9100] Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.
[9101] Thus it is spoken.
[9102] At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.
[9103] Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[9104] Dharmatā pure appearance, awareness, and
[9105] Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[9106] Again conducting dharmatā cease-appearance.
[9107] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[9108] <tantra> Wisdom-perfect appearance and
[9109] <tantra> From dharmatā's first appearance,
[9110] <tantra> From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.
[9111] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9112] <tantra> At this time, body-speech-mind measures.
[9113] <tantra> When seeing individual appearances,
[9114] <tantra> Signs complete by ripening in self,
[9115] <tantra> Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
[9116] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9117] Thus by taking experience, those with supreme effort: three years.
[9118] Middle ones: five years.
[9119] Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[9120] Six days: seeing dharmatā cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.
[9121] <tantra> From that same source:
[9122] <tantra> By great and small effort in this,
[9123] <tantra> By days, months, and years,
[9124] <tantra> Certainly accomplish at individual times.
[9125] <tantra> From times without much moving,
[9126] <tantra> Reach individual measures.
[9127] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9128] This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking.
[9129] Third: determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[9130] Gathering sense-faculties to the essential point of the continuum, closing memory's door.
[9131] Putting knowable objects in the vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly.
[9132] At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place.
[9133] Striking with vast appearance by day,
[9134] Suppressing all signs.
[9135] Though these were explained formerly,
[9136] Here also explained as thögal companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[9137] There is distinction slightly different from former.
[9138] Daytime, looking at the manifest by elephant-gaze,
[9139] Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[9140] Nighttime, placing cognition on the bindu-empty lamp.
[9141] When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion.
[9142] When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle. In the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.
[9143] As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[9144] Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[9145] At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[9146] Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.
[9147] Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[9148] The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within.
[9149] Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.
[9150] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[9151] <tantra> Pressing the bodily posture,
[9152] <tantra> Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
[9153] <tantra> Likewise, eyes to the space between,
[9154] <tantra> By elephant gaze
[9155] <tantra> Place in great spreading without memory.
[9156] <tantra> Thus cast awareness to sky.
[9157] <tantra> Without separating from this,
[9158] <tantra> The yogin who meditates continuously
[9159] <tantra> Expands appearances by day.
[9160] <tantra> At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,
[9161] <tantra> To hold the measure of four equal times,
[9162] <tantra> Gathering sense doors oneself,
[9163] <tantra> To the lamp of empty bindu,
[9164] <tantra> The endowed yogin places mind.
[9165] <tantra> When that bindu expands,
[9166] <tantra> Place consciousness expanding as well.
[9167] <tantra> When bindu becomes subtle,
[9168] <tantra> Bindu increasingly subtle,
[9169] <tantra> Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
[9170] <tantra> By essential point of sleep and dream,
[9171] <tantra> Extract root of former attachment habits.
[9172] <tantra> Thus in all times of night,
[9173] <tantra> The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
[9174] <tantra> By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
[9175] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9176] Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[9177] Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.
[9178] <tantra> From that same source:
[9179] <tantra> By body, field, and awareness,
[9180] <tantra> Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.
[9181] <tantra> Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
[9182] <tantra> Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
[9183] <tantra> At the time of ceasing that,
[9184] <tantra> Awareness reaches the measure.
[9185] <tantra> When thus reaching the measure,
[9186] <tantra> One's own body also does not appear.
[9187] <tantra> The flesh-blood body produced by elements
[9188] <tantra> Because elements are pure in their own place,
[9189] <tantra> Because this appears as field,
[9190] <tantra> The mind-body grasped by delusion
[9191] <tantra> Because elements dissolve in their own place,
[9192] <tantra> This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
[9193] <tantra> The light-body grasped by awareness
[9194] <tantra> Is like the water-moon mandala.
[9195] <tantra> At this time, near dharmatā cessation,
[9196] <tantra> Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
[9197] <tantra> Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
[9198] <tantra> Obtain the action-free perfect body.
[9199] <tantra> At this time, all limits of body
[9200] <tantra> Are near to freedom.
[9201] <tantra> The yogin familiar with the base
[9202] <tantra> Also empties one's own place.
[9203] <tantra> The yogin familiar with the path
[9204] <tantra> Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
[9205] <tantra> Whoever is familiar with the fruit
[9206] <tantra> Reaches the non-return ground by this.
[9207] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9208] Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samādhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye,
[9209] While the samādhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.
[9210] Third: extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:
[9211] Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[9212] Extensively explaining the nature,
[9213] Summarizing the meaning by aspect.
[9214] First:
[9215] <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:
[9216] <tantra> Also, what are the five intentions?
[9217] <tantra> By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
[9218] <tantra> By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground.
[9219] <tantra> By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
[9220] <tantra> By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.
[9221] <tantra> By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.
[9222] Second, from five:
