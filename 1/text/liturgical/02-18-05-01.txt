[4601] <ornament>First, speech training:</ornament>
[4602] <prose>Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;</prose>
[4603] <prose>Then train long;</prose>
[4604] <prose>Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.</prose>
[4605] <prose>Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;</prose>
[4606] <prose>Not mixing even one syllable with others.</prose>
[4607] <prose>At this time, the body's sign makes meaning understood.</prose>
[4608] <prose>Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;</prose>
[4609] <prose>Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—</prose>
[4610] <prose>Not even body sign. || 10 ||</prose>
[4611] <tantra>From the Seed Tantra:</tantra>
[4612] <verse>Speech like a mute,</verse>
[4613] <verse>Not making sign with anyone,</verse>
[4614] <verse>Thus, whoever does this—</verse>
[4615] <verse>Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.</verse>
[4616] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4617] <prose>Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.</prose>
[4618] <prose>Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.</prose>
[4619] <prose>By body purified, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and sky-goer Ḍākinīs</prose>
[4620] <prose>Bless, liberating body into illusory body. || 20 ||</prose>
[4621] <prose>Then, object blocked, speech purified—</prose>
[4622] <prose>Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.</prose>
[4623] <prose>Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—</prose>
[4624] <prose>That sign: first seeing non-human form,</prose>
[4625] <prose>Then clairvoyance arises.</prose>
[4626] <prose>Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.</prose>
[4627] <prose>Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.</prose>
[4628] <tantra>From Thalgyur:</tantra>
[4629] <verse>Mind placed in dhātu, accomplished.</verse>
[4630] <tantra>Thus it was said. || 30 ||</tantra>
[4631] <prose>Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—dhātu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut. From the Seed Tantra:</prose>
[4632] <verse>Thus binding body, speech, and three—</verse>
[4633] <verse>In dharmadhātu's vision,</verse>
[4634] <verse>This becomes habituation.</verse>
[4635] <tantra>Thus it was said, and:</tantra>
[4636] <verse>Body and speech and mind's main-point—</verse>
[4637] <verse>Know and rely, liberate from saṃsāra.</verse>
[4638] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4639] <ornament>Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:</ornament>
[4640] <list>Bind three main-points in vajra seal; || 40 ||</list>
[4641] <list>Introduce awareness's own face directly;</list>
[4642] <list>Show vision's dawning manner from that.</list>
[4643] <prose>First, two are:</prose>
[4644] <list>Show general seal of three main-points,</list>
[4645] <list>Deliver particular self's main-point to point.</list>
[4646] <prose>First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.</prose>
[4647] <tantra>From Thalgyur:</tantra>
[4648] <verse>Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;</verse>
[4649] <verse>That also: gate and field itself,</verse>
[4650] <verse>Wind and awareness main-point itself seal. || 50 ||</verse>
[4651] <tantra>Thus said.</tantra>
[4652] <prose>Example: like weapon hitting vital point—</prose>
[4653] <prose>Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,</prose>
[4654] <prose>Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.</prose>
[4655] <prose>Three main-points also: dharmatā no ground for change.</prose>
[4656] <prose>Gate main-point: cause to see;</prose>
[4657] <prose>Field main-point: cause not to change;</prose>
[4658] <prose>Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.</prose>
[4659] <prose>That also: gate main-point like threshold;</prose>
[4660] <prose>Field main-point like escort; || 60 ||</prose>
[4661] <prose>Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.</prose>
[4662] <prose>Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;</prose>
[4663] <prose>Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—</prose>
[4664] <prose>Impossible not to hit dharmatā direct main-point.</prose>
[4665] <prose>That also: field not existing, no basis ground;</prose>
[4666] <prose>Gate not existing, beings' path lost;</prose>
[4667] <prose>Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—</prose>
[4668] <prose>Therefore three main-points determined.</prose>
[4669] <prose>More than that: limitless, lose main-point;</prose>
[4670] <prose>Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined. || 70 ||</prose>
[4671] <ornament>Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:</ornament>
[4672] <prose>Determine general sequence of three main-points, deliver individual main-points to point. First: body, speech, mind three not moving, gate and field and wind-awareness bound.</prose>
[4673] <prose>Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:</prose>
[4674] <tantra>From the Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,</tantra>
[4675] <verse>Thus body, etcetera—</verse>
[4676] <verse>By fully pressing all main-points,</verse>
[4677] <verse>Awareness itself and directly,</verse>
[4678] <verse>From guru's instruction, know.</verse>
[4679] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4680] <tantra>From Thalgyur: || 80 ||</tantra>
[4681] <verse>Relying upon actual main, self mind,</verse>
[4682] <verse>Body main-point and speech and also,</verse>
[4683] <verse>Relying upon mind main-point,</verse>
[4684] <verse>Making wind somehow slow,</verse>
[4685] <verse>Arising from fully projecting,</verse>
[4686] <verse>Body and mind connection cut that,</verse>
[4687] <verse>Not reversing even in three realms.</verse>
[4688] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4689] <verse>Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;</verse>
[4690] <verse>Field: separate from obscuration-doer; || 90 ||</verse>
[4691] <verse>Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.</verse>
[4692] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4693] <ornament>Second: from three main-points—gate,</ornament>
[4694] <list>Field,</list>
[4695] <list>And wind-awareness.</list>
