[4601] First, speech training:
[4602] Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
[4603] Then train long;
[4604] Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.
[4605] Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
[4606] Not mixing even one syllable with others.
[4607] At this time, body's sign makes meaning understood.
[4608] Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
[4609] Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
[4610] Not even body sign.
[4611] From Seed Tantra:
[4612] Speech like a mute,
[4613] Not making sign with anyone,
[4614] Thus, whoever does this—
[4615] Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.
[4616] Thus it was said.
[4617] Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
[4618] Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
[4619] By body purified, buddhas and bodhisattvas and sky-goer dakinis
[4620] Bless, liberating body into illusory body.
[4621] Then, object blocked, speech purified—
[4622] Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
[4623] Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
[4624] That sign: first seeing non-human form,
[4625] Then clairvoyance arises.
[4626] Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
[4627] Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
[4628] From Thalgyur:
[4629] Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished.
[4630] Thus it was said.
[4631] Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—  Dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut.  From Seed Tantra.
[4632] Thus binding body, speech, and three—
[4633] In dharmadhatu's vision,
[4634] This becomes habituation.
[4635] Thus it was said, and:
[4636] Body and speech and mind's main-point—
[4637] Know and rely, liberate from samsara.
[4638] Thus it was said.
[4639] Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
[4640] Bind three main-points in vajra seal;
[4641] Introduce awareness's own face directly;
[4642] Show vision's dawning manner from that.
[4643] First, two are:
[4644] Show general seal of three main-points,
[4645] Deliver particular self's main-point to point.
[4646] First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.
[4647] From Thalgyur:
[4648] Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
[4649] That also: gate and field itself,
[4650] Wind and awareness main-point itself seal.
[4651] Thus said.
[4652] Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
[4653] Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
[4654] Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
[4655] Three main-points also: dharmata no ground for change.
[4656] Gate main-point: cause to see;
[4657] Field main-point: cause not to change;
[4658] Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.
[4659] That also: gate main-point like threshold;
[4660] Field main-point like escort;
[4661] Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.
[4662] Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
[4663] Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
[4664] Impossible not to hit dharmata direct main-point.
[4665] That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
[4666] Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
[4667] Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
[4668] Therefore three main-points determined.
[4669] More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
[4670] Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined.
[4671] Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:
[4672] Determine general sequence of three main-points,  Deliver individual main-points to point.  First: body, speech, mind three not moving,  Gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
[4673] Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
[4674] From Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
[4675] Thus body, etcetera—
[4676] By fully pressing all main-points,
[4677] Awareness itself and directly,
[4678] From guru's instruction, know.
[4679] Thus said, and:
[4680] From Thalgyur:
[4681] Relying upon actual main, self mind,
[4682] Body main-point and speech and also,
[4683] Relying upon mind main-point,
[4684] Making wind somehow slow,
[4685] Arising from fully projecting,
[4686] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4687] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4688] Thus said, and:
[4689] Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
[4690] Field: separate from obscuration-doer;
[4691] Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.
[4692] Thus it was said.
[4693] Second: from three main-points—gate,
[4694] Field,
[4695] And wind-awareness.
