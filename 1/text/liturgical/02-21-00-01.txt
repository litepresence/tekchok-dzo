[9308] <prose> Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.</prose>
[9309] <prose> These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:</prose>
[9310] <tantra> From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:</tantra>
[9311] <verse> Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,</verse>
[9312] <verse> The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.</verse>
[9313] <verse> Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.</verse>

[9321] <verse> Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,</verse>
[9322] <verse> The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.</verse>
[9323] <tantra> The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.</tantra>
[9324] <prose> To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body</prose>
[9325] <prose> Should be introduced.</prose>
[9326] <prose> In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.</prose>
[9327] <prose> That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa, || 160 ||</prose>
[9328] <prose> The teacher holds a single clear mirror,</prose>
[9329] <prose> Shows the student,</prose>

[9331] <verse> "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,</verse>
[9332] <verse> "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.</verse>
[9333] <verse> "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.</verse>
[9334] <verse> "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.</verse>

[9339] <tantra> Thus it is said.</tantra>
[9340] <prose> Though five lights are clear to outer eye,</prose>

[9342] <prose> Nature:</prose>
[9343] <prose> White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.</prose>
[9344] <prose> Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,</prose>
[9345] <prose> By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within.</prose>
[9346] <prose> Then demonstrating delusion-base:</prose>
[9347] <prose> Extend crystal to sun-ray, || 180 ||</prose>
[9348] <prose> Demonstrate outer two interior lights,</prose>
[9349] <prose> Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.</prose>
[9350] <prose> Field possessing five colors,</prose>
[9351] <prose> Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.</prose>
[9352] <prose> That beginning move arises together with light,</prose>

[9362] <tantra> Thus spoken from Manjushri.</tantra>
[9363] <prose> Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.</prose>
[9364] <prose> Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in samsara now also arise from space.</prose>
[9365] <prose> That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear,</prose>
[9366] <prose> Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.</prose>
[9367] <tantra> Thus, || 200 ||</tantra>
[9368] <prose> Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.</prose>
[9369] <prose> That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,</prose>
[9370] <prose> Or placing each white light on each white color etc.</prose>
[9371] <prose> There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.</prose>

[9380] <tantra> Make all thus spoken understood, well apply sign meaning.</tantra>
[9381] <prose> Sign meaning of liberating deluded sentient beings:</prose>
[9382] <tantra> From Lamp Blaze:</tantra>
[9383] <verse> Base itself, wisdom making fruit ripen.</verse>
[9384] <verse> By ripening in wisdom-body,</verse>

[9395] <prose> That example introduction of mind and wisdom two is suitable.</prose>
[9396] <prose> Intermediate introduction: sound, light, ray three,</prose>
[9397] <prose> And Vajra-Mind heart-interval nadi path introduction etc. appropriate all, produce certain knowing in crystal. || 230 ||</prose>
[9398] <prose> Yogin applying essence and knowing, making confidence, should be diligent in experience.</prose>
[9399] <ornament> Liberation manner as fruit:</ornament>
[9400] <prose> Though above interior-clear primordially pure liberation base is clear as self-arise essence-itself body,</prose>
[9401] <prose> Called outer-clear,</prose>
[9402] <prose> Give introduction to mixing five lights and white two.</prose>
[9403] <prose> This has great essential point if wisdom exists.</prose>
[9404] <prose> Path wisdom or</prose>

[9408] <prose> Arising without ceasing two bodies.</prose>
[9409] <prose> Wisdom must exist in space,</prose>

[9411] <prose> Example of white arising separately, emanation-body emanating from enjoyment-body.</prose>
[9412] <prose> Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.</prose>
[9413] <prose> Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvana":</prose>

[9422] <prose> However, like sun obscured by cloud,</prose>
[9423] <prose> From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,</prose>
[9424] <prose> Beginning base and</prose>
