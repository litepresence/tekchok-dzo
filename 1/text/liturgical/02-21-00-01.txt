[9293] <prose> Though there are many forms of showing examples, among examples, that which becomes supreme is called the precious crystal.
[9294] <prose> Through showing by means of the crystal, naturally completely pure, clear without outside or inside,
[9295] <prose> Recognize the dharmakāya.
[9296] <prose> Relying on the inner light of the crystal,

[9307] <prose> Through showing the nature of the crystal itself, recognize the single abiding nature. || 140 ||
[9308] <prose> Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.
[9309] <prose> These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:
[9310] <prose> <tantra> From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:
[9311] <verse> Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,
[9312] <verse> The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.
[9313] <verse> Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.

[9318] <verse> Through prajñā arising from conditions,
[9319] <verse> Through ripening in the manner of fruit,
[9320] <verse> The darkness of non-recognition is cleared.
[9321] <verse> Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,
[9322] <verse> The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.
[9323] <prose> <tantra> The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.
[9324] <prose> To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body
[9325] <prose> Should be introduced.
[9326] <prose> In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.
[9327] <prose> That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa, || 160 ||
[9328] <prose> The teacher holds a single clear mirror,
[9329] <prose> Shows the student,
[9330] <prose> And speaks these words:
[9331] <verse> "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,
[9332] <verse> "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.
[9333] <verse> "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.
[9334] <verse> "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.
[9335] <verse> "rigpa abiding in direct penetration is like crystal.
[9336] <verse> "rigpa, thought-free and clear, is like crystal.
[9337] <verse> "rigpa abiding in spontaneous presence is like crystal. || 170 ||
[9338] <verse> "rigpa, unceasing and direction-free, is like crystal."
[9339] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is said.
[9340] <prose> Though five lights are clear to outer eye,
[9341] <prose> Possessing nature of clear from within,
[9342] <prose> Nature:
[9343] <prose> White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.
[9344] <prose> Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,
[9345] <prose> By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within.
[9346] <prose> Then demonstrating delusion-base:
[9347] <prose> Extend crystal to sun-ray, || 180 ||
[9348] <prose> Demonstrate outer two interior lights,
[9349] <prose> Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.
[9350] <prose> Field possessing five colors,
[9351] <prose> Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.
[9352] <prose> That beginning move arises together with light,
[9353] <prose> Arises as knowable's obscuration: co-arising ignorance.
[9354] <prose> By wisdom's sense-power transcending from All-Good base, separate distinction in one moment,
[9355] <prose> Complete Buddha in one moment,
[9356] <prose> Is before Buddha as great-grandfather without common of all Buddhas.
[9357] <prose> By this liberation manner, || 190 ||
[9358] <prose> Should know all first Buddha's arising manner and arising manner.
[9359] <verse> First Buddha without cause,
[9360] <verse> Buddha without beginning or end,
[9361] <verse> One wisdom eye without stain.
[9362] <prose> <tantra> Thus spoken from Manjushri.
[9363] <prose> Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.
[9364] <prose> Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in saṃsāra now also arise from space.
[9365] <prose> That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear,
[9366] <prose> Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.
[9367] <prose> <tantra> Thus, || 200 ||
[9368] <prose> Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.
[9369] <prose> That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,
[9370] <prose> Or placing each white light on each white color etc.
[9371] <prose> There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.
[9372] <prose> Entering body's interior,
[9373] <prose> Manner of four-holding awareness abiding in heart center,
[9374] <prose> Give introduction to manner pervading all sentient beings.
[9375] <prose> That is also introduction of nature's delusion manner.
[9376] <verse> Delusion arising from condition like crystal light.
[9377] <verse> Various things appearing like crystal light. || 210 ||
[9378] <verse> Appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal.
[9379] <verse> Without exhaust, without increase, like crystal light.
[9380] <prose> <tantra> Make all thus spoken understood, well apply sign meaning.
[9381] <prose> Sign meaning of liberating deluded sentient beings:
[9382] <prose> <tantra> From Lamp Blaze:
[9383] <verse> Base itself, wisdom making fruit ripen.
[9384] <verse> By ripening in wisdom-body,
[9385] <verse> That essence-itself Dharma-body
[9386] <verse> Ripens in wisdom Dharma-body.
[9387] <prose> <tantra> From thus speaking. || 220 ||
[9388] <prose> From heart center, wisdom three-stack lung wind and wisdom's two tones meeting,
[9389] <prose> Power becoming mind,
[9390] <prose> Example of abiding unmoving dissolving in base manner.
[9391] <prose> Example of white mind, interior light emanating outer.
[9392] <prose> Called sixth mind.
[9393] <prose> Example of five lights wisdom.
[9394] <prose> Awareness holding base.
[9395] <prose> That example introduction of mind and wisdom two is suitable.
[9396] <prose> Intermediate introduction: sound, light, ray three,
[9397] <prose> And Vajra-Mind heart-interval nadi path introduction etc. appropriate all, produce certain knowing in crystal. || 230 ||
[9398] <prose> Yogin applying essence and knowing, making confidence, should be diligent in experience.
[9399] <ornament> Liberation manner as fruit:
[9400] <prose> Though above interior-clear primordially pure liberation base is clear as self-arise essence-itself body,
[9401] <prose> Called outer-clear,
[9402] <prose> Give introduction to mixing five lights and white two.
[9403] <prose> This has great essential point if wisdom exists.
[9404] <prose> Path wisdom or
[9405] <prose> Desiring wisdom without extremely not abiding middle,
[9406] <prose> Or desiring wisdom without in our great perfect primordially pure,
[9407] <prose> Though delusion pure from root, || 240 ||
[9408] <prose> Arising without ceasing two bodies.
[9409] <prose> Wisdom must exist in space,
[9410] <prose> That mixing of five lights and white is mirror wisdom.
[9411] <prose> Example of white arising separately, emanation-body emanating from enjoyment-body.
[9412] <prose> Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.
[9413] <prose> Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvāṇa":
[9414] <prose> Emanation-body and enjoyment-body dissolving into Dharma-body,
[9415] <prose> By being free from crystal sun's condition,
[9416] <prose> Abiding undeluded having seized stable ground at beginning's primordially pure base,
[9417] <prose> Though liberated like that, essence not separate, || 250 ||
[9418] <prose> By distinction of aware and not-aware,
[9419] <prose> Called all-knowing: all abiding only in wisdom-body.
[9420] <prose> Mainly possessing two wisdoms.
[9421] <prose> Existing as interior-clear, that essence delivering to cease ground and first human's common-base self-arise essence-itself body are not separate.
[9422] <prose> However, like sun obscured by cloud,
[9423] <prose> From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,
[9424] <prose> Beginning base and
[9425] <prose> End liberation ground two—very great distinction.
[9426] <prose> Great essential point.
[9427] <verse> Wisdom swirling in space like crystal light. || 260 ||
[9428] <verse> Dharma-body arising clear-pure like crystal itself.
[9429] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9430] <prose> That Dharma-body of knowing self-essence, self itself abiding in self-bed,
[9431] <prose> If desiring to hold stable ground of undeluded Dharma-body now also,
[9432] <prose> Great essential point is keeping undistracted, clear, snap in manner of great open naked self-clear,
[9433] <prose> <tantra> From glorious holy guru protector of beings' mouth:
[9434] <verse> Dharma-body of knowing self-essence is self-bed itself,
[9435] <verse> All who desire to hold stable undeluded ground,
[9436] <verse> Essential point is doing not-wrong, not-deluded, not-distracted,
[9437] <verse> Let wisdom-possessing know intention like ocean. || 270 ||
[9438] <prose> <tantra> Thus well spoken.
[9439] <prose> At time of all this introduction, relaxing freshly, self also producing uncommon new confidence, should demonstrate to others.
[9440] <prose> <tantra> Also from World Sun Dharma-Lord Guru's mouth:
[9441] <prose> <tantra> Should carefully give introductions in sequence.
[9442] <ornament> Ha-le!
[9443] <ornament> Ho-le!
[9444] <prose> Without portion of what exists.
[9445] <prose> Not introduction.
[9446] <prose> Not introduced, do not.
[9447] <prose> Do not declare non-Dharma action. || 280 ||
[9448] <prose> Do not follow for delusion.
[9449] <prose> Do not do bad non-Dharma actions taking guru etc.'s name.
[9450] <prose> <tantra> Thus making instruction: need to make name and meaning together.
[9451] <prose> Respectfully place in mind thus all who have entered this Dharma in future times.
[9452] <ornament> Second meaning: extensively demonstrating mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction has two aspects:
[9453] <prose> Mind's introduction of delusion reversing manner from root awareness,
[9454] <prose> And self-appear wisdom's introduction of awareness with self-appear.
[9455] <ornament> First:
[9456] <prose> <tantra> From Introduction Ornament:
[9457] <ornament> E-ma-ho! || 290 ||
[9458] <verse> Manner of coming to mind by giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9459] <verse> Reach expanding bliss of empty by giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9460] <verse> Giving introduction of empty as awareness,

[9462] <prose> In this, three:
[9463] <list> Establishing inner mind by outer field's essential point,
[9464] <list> Establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point,
[9465] <list> Establishing supreme awareness itself by secret space's essential point.
[9466] <prose> First, demonstrating deluded baseless appearance field,
[9467] <prose> From two: demonstrating self-mind empty of appearance-holding. || 300 ||
