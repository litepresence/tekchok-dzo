[1463] From ten complete, some abandoned life-killing, that time life year twenty increase.
[1464] Likewise abandoned not-given taking, forty,
[1465] Abandoned misconduct, hundred,
[1466] Abandoned divisive-speech, two-hundred,
[1467] Abandoned idle-speech, five-hundred,
[1468] Abandoned harsh-speech, thousand,
[1469] Abandoned covetousness, two-thousand,
[1470] Abandoned harmful-intent, ten-thousand,
[1471] Abandoned wrong-view, twenty-thousand,
[1472] Abandoned ignorant desire attachment, forty-thousand,
[1473] Abandoned wrong dharma practice, eighty-thousand became.
[1474] Life increase like, form and enjoyment also increase,
[1475] Prosperous spread.
[1476] Then again eighteen decrease-and-increase each section, called eighteen intermediate gap.
[1477] Third upward increase one:
[1478] From similar calculation custom after complete intermediate gap.

[1479] Called not-begin long, went to countless endure, suddenly like decrease.
[1480] Between these, from beings' merit light:
[1481] Virtue,
[1482] Buddha,
[1483] Dharma,
[1484] Sangha,
[1485] Dwell countless completely-white dharma enumerations,
[1486] From not-merit:
[1487] Suffering, wrong direction go,
[1488] Perverted teacher,
[1489] Philosophical view enumeration,
[1490] Action, afflictions etc.,
[1491] Six beings,
[1492] Four birth,
[1493] Individual light object,
[1494] Enjoyment,
[1495] Engage various pleasure-pain to light.
[1496] Then twenty intermediate eons destruction:
[1497] From complete abiding, change light arisen,
[1498] That also: nineteen intermediate eons essence destroy,
[1499] One vessel destroy, twenty pass.
[1500] Beings destroy manner:
[1501] Begin from hell place this not become birth to new forest,
[1502] Transferred life old hell preta animal this land,
[1503] Empty new not born, lower-realms destroyed.
[1504] That also: certain birth to new lower-realms by misdeed performed, exist this, go other land lower-realms, empty not-born here.
[1505] Then humans destroy: gradually decrease life year, die by disease eon at ten life year,
[1506] Passed three small eons harm by weapon famine,
[1507] One human obtained concentration two without taught by anyone this Jambu continent,
[1508] From arose that, said speak extremely bliss this joy arisen from seclusion,
[1509] Effortless all heard, equipoise accomplished, born light god,
[1510] Like Jambu continent empty,
[1511] Body-elevated continent and cow-enjoyment also became that-like.
[1512] Sound-not-heard thirty-three born.

[1513] From four Great Kings to Great Brahma, likewise.
[1514] Vessel destroyed: sun one extremely hot arisen in sky, burned grass trees.
[1515] Two arisen, dried rivers streams ponds.
[1516] Three arisen, dried great rivers streams.
[1517] Four arisen, dried never-warm lake.
[1518] Five arisen, dried great ocean.
[1519] Six arisen, dried great land with snow-mountain.
[1520] Seven arisen, burned all hundred ten-million spontaneously-arisen seven mountains etc.,
[1521] From swirling blazing fire-flame,
[1522] Below reached hell place gold ground,
[1523] Above thoroughly blaze between Brahma world.
[1524] Seven times burn by all thoroughly blaze, not even ash.
[1525] Seven suns and seven blazes, seven fires.
[1526] Then below base clear pure water disturbed scattered, pervaded seven times extent of concentration two,
[1527] Destroyed with measureless-palace like dissolved salt water.
[1528] That water seven.
[1529] Then below base wind vajra-cross arose, all scattered, destroyed below concentration three, became one sky.
[1530] Thus after form abiding destruction, one nature sky empty.
[1531] That also: common vehicle likewise, twenty-eight tens intermediate eons regarded one great eon.
[1532] Pure: birth aging sick dying four, join inner form destroy empty.
[1533] From result-transmission,
[1534] Meaning: destroy and form,
[1535] Abiding itself and empty,
[1536] Birth aging sick dying,
[1537] Existence illusion-wheel itself.
[1538] Said, join.
[1539] That also: from first measureless to end ten, twenty with first final gap,
[1540] Upward birth downward decrease, not-decrease end ten that much only,
[1541] Disease weapon famine small eon each exist.


### PAGE 48

[1542] Such is the final end.
[1543] From that point, all vessels and essences are utterly destroyed.
[1544] These as well—the three abodes of destruction and emptiness—
[1545] In this uncommon vehicle, the intermediate eons are counted as equal: sixty by sixty, comprising the first great eon of one hundred eighty duration-measures.
[1546] The duration-eon of one hundred eighty is termed the "intermediate eon, the second."
[1547] The intermediate eon of one hundred eighty is considered the "single great eon."
[1548] These also arise from the very nature of transformation.
[1549] This transformation of time unfolds as follows:
[1550] From the primordial measureless beginning,
[1551] Through the ten terminal intervals,
[1552] There is ascent and descent, birth and diminishment.
[1553] Disease, famine, weapons, and strife—
[1554] Three lesser eons bridge the intervals.
[1555] The sixty are exhausted by fire,
[1556] Seven by fire, seven by water.
[1557] Thus fourteen are completed,
[1558] And the remainder is dissolved by wind.
[1559] Thus the sixty abide,
[1560] And the duration of destruction is of similar measure.
[1561] The interval of sixty abides as emptiness.
[1562] Thus from one hundred eighty,
[1563] The first duration-eon is established.
[1564] Thus one hundred eighty
[1565] Constitute the second intermediate eon.
[1566] Thus that which is joined together is
[1567] The single great eon.
[1568] Thus it is taught.
[1569] These detailed explanations with their definitive meanings are
[1570] As extensively taught in the extensive tantra of the wish-fulfilling tree.
[1571] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1572] The presentation of the world of vessels and essences, in two volumes.
[1573] Thus having instructed and shown the sequence of vessels and essences,
[1574] Now, regarding the enumeration of phenomena and aggregates existing in the elements of those three vajra-states:
[1575] From the tantra of the union of sun and moon:
[1576] The elements, the aggregates,
[1577] The sense-sources, the powers,
[1578] The objects and the awarenesses possessed of duration—
[1579] How they abide shall be definitively set forth.
[1580] Thus the meaning has five aspects:
[1581] The joy of the element-objects.
