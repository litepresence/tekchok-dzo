[15629] Third, etc., gather.
[15630] That also water wind by-means-of water-yellow impure and purify.
[15631] Water earth by-means-of blood and flesh pure and impure.
[15632] Water fire by-means-of water-block work gather and separate.
[15633] Water water by-means-of saliva and eye-water move and not-move.
[15634] Earth earth by-means-of flesh produce,
[15635] That by-means-of fat and
[15636] Bone and
[15637] Marrow and
[15638] Bodhicitta sequence five produce.
[15639] Earth water by-means-of bindu work,
[15640] Mercury piece like become, son not-come.
[15641] Rta-rnga knot like, daughter and
[15642] Eye-corner small like from son ripen.
[15643] Earth fire by-means-of heat produce,
[15644] That by-means-of vessel and
[15645] Object and
[15646] Phur shib make,
[15647] Birth aging disease death four work.
[15648] Earth wind by-means-of strength and complexion and
[15649] Trembling-movement and
[15650] Paralysis etc. doing.
[15651] Fire nadi wind by-means-of vaporized, ripening-essence scent-water variety.
[15652] Scent-water thickening and
[15653] Coagulating and
[15654] Scattering and
[15655] Drawing four from,
[15656] Male sense-organ rising capacity not,
[15657] Always numb and
[15658] Month one times-some flows.
[15659] The moon waxing, on the second or third day, if the menstrual flow is unstained, a son develops.
[15660] In the middle of the month, around the fifteenth, if it flows, a daughter develops.
[15661] If it wanes and always flows, both son and daughter mixed ripening occurs.
[15662] If menstruation is prolonged and blood is excessive, either twenty-two or five always flows, no child arises.
[15663] Earth wind by means of sense organs and sense bases produces,
[15664] And by means of that, actions and many thoughts arise.
[15665] Wind fire by means of consciousness produces power: lightness and heaviness, spreading and humming, fullness and emptiness.
[15666] Wind wind by means of breath moving outside and inside,
[15667] For females, liver disease arises when a child is conceived,
[15668] And for males, wine disease arises.
[15669] Wind water by means of thought ceases and non-thought arises.
[15670] Thus section five part two is complete.
[15671] Third, etc., gather.
[15672] That also: water wind by means of water-yellow, impurity and purification.
[15673] Water earth by means of blood and flesh, purity and impurity.
[15674] Water fire by means of water-block, work gathers and separates.
[15675] Water water by means of saliva and eye-water, movement and non-movement.
[15676] Earth earth by means of flesh produces,
[15677] That by means of fat and
[15678] Bone and
[15679] Marrow and
[15680] Bodhicitta, five sequences produce.
[15681] Earth water by means of bindu works,
[15682] Like a mercury piece, the son does not come.
[15683] Like the knot of the horse-tambourine, the daughter and
[15684] Like the small corner of the eye, the son's ripening work arises.
[15685] Earth fire by means of heat produces,
[15686] That by means of vessel and
[15687] Object and
[15688] The phurbu making,
[15689] The four works of birth, aging, sickness, and death.
[15690] Earth wind by means of strength and complexion and
[15691] Trembling-movement and
[15692] Paralysis, etc., arise.
[15693] Fire nadi wind by means of vaporization produces the ripening essence's scent-water variety.
[15694] Scent-water thickening and
[15695] Coagulating and
[15696] Scattering and
[15697] Drawing, four arise.
[15698] For males, the rising capacity of the sense organs is absent,
[15699] Always numb and
[15700] If the seed flows at the wrong time and
[15701] If the object is not contacted, it rises; if contacted, it does not rise, and
[15702] If it rises and contacts, and
[15703] For females, menstruation not flowing becomes disease and
[15704] If it flows at the wrong time and
[15705] The moon once, sometimes it flows.
[15706] The moon waxing, on the second or third day, if the menstrual stain does not flow, a son develops.
[15707] In the middle of the moon, around the fifteenth, if it flows, a daughter develops.
[15708] If it wanes and always flows, son and daughter mixed ripening occurs.
[15709] If menstruation is prolonged and blood is much, twenty-two or five always flows, no child at all arises.
[15710] Earth wind by means of sense organs and sense bases produces.
[15711] By means of that, actions and many thoughts arise.
[15712] Wind fire by means of consciousness power produces lightness and heaviness, spreading and humming, fullness and emptiness.
[15713] Wind wind by means of breath moving outside and inside,
[15714] For females, when a child is conceived, liver disease arises,
[15715] For males, it becomes wine disease.
[15716] Wind water by means of thought ceases and non-thought arises.
[15717] Earth wind by means of limbs extends, gathers, etc.
[15718] Fire wind by means of defilements' various powers arises.
[15719] Wind wind and fire mixing produce
[15720] Various wisdom powers and
[15721] Wonderful separating from examples and
[15722] Skilled in the words and meanings of Dharma and
[15723] Skilled in service for females and
[15724] Skillful in body-speech mental displays.
[15725] That also: the arising sequence of the four elements.
[15726] From the changes of the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter—
[15727] The arising sequence transforms.
[15728] Sickness and
[15729] Heat and
[15730] Death and
[15731] The differences of body-speech-mind actions are demonstrated.
[15732] That also: the arising sequence's impairment and
[15733] Corruption and
[15734] Decline and
[15735] Change.
[15736] At the time of going, impairment and
[15737] Corruption and
[15738] Decline and
[15739] Change arise.
[15740] That also: at the time of passing, if long, change eliminates and abides, so changes are certain.
[15741] At the time of future, if long, passing eliminates and abides, so it is certain as the state of abiding.
[15742] In the present, if short, the work of exertion and calculation by change is known.
[15743] The internal passing's certain measure:
[15744] That also: when the person reaches prime age, for one day and one night, the wind's number is twenty-one thousand six hundred.
[15745] That also: combining with water measures and the abacus calculation,
[15746] One day has eight periods.
[15747] Each period has thirty-two moments.
[15748] Each moment has sixty-four breaths.
[15749] The passing is sixteen.
[15750] Each passing has one thousand three hundred fifty breaths.
[15751] Each breath has three hundred thirty-seven and a half.
[15752] Each period has twenty-seven hundred.
[15753] That way, one day's twelve functions produce twenty-two and a half shilugs.
[15754] Thus the twelve winds increase and decrease as demonstrated.
[15755] Their increase and decrease: the sun moving north and south, and
[15756] The days and nights becoming long and short in that manner.
[15757] From the commentary of the White Lotus:
[15758] "When going north and south, add and subtract."
[15759] The sun moving north each month: by two water-clocks the sun becomes long
[15760] And the night becomes short.
[15761] When going south, those two reverse: the day becomes short and the night becomes long.
[15762] That way, the wind's six hundred seventy-five passing elements increase and decrease as follows:
[15763] By the measure of each water-clock.
[15764] That also: one year has twelve months.
[15765] Three hundred sixty days.
[15766] Seven hundred meals and twenty meals calculated.
[15767] For one day and night, by the twelve times, nine thousand three hundred fifty and two thoughts move suddenly.
[15768] Nine thousand twenty-eight, by the measure of pure wisdom wind, it is held.
