[5928] Tenth: obtaining Dharma-Cloud-Like Ground.
[5929] That is obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-seeing.
[5930] Those persons who abandon the shell obtain thus.
[5931] Vision ceasing delusion-vision, dawning as heap-vision is eleventh: obtaining All-Light Ground.
[5932] Then, not attaching to that vision also, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas is
[5933] Twelfth: obtaining Non-Attaching Lotus-Possessing Ground.
[5934] Then, from self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner:
[5935] Thirteenth: obtaining Great Collection Wheel of Letters Ground.
[5936] Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is fourteenth: obtaining Great Samadhi Ground.
[5937] Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is fifteenth: obtaining Vajra-Holder Ground. || 10 ||
[5938] Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that, is
[5939] Sixteenth: obtaining Wisdom-Guru Ground.
[5940] Those are applied through similar aspects of vision manner, not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.
[5941] Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness luminosity without purifying or traversing.
[5942] In meaning, it is one awareness ground.
[5943] For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed,
[5944] For they are applied thus to different entry-doors of path vitals.
[5945] The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and
[5946] Mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification.
[5947] From that itself: || 20 ||
[5948] Therefore, although inconceivable beings exist, there is not more than one wisdom essence.
[5949] "Ground" and "path" do not exist separately.
[5950] Know that there is no need to purify or traverse ground and path.
[5951] From the Kun byed:
[5952] Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified.
[5953] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[5954] Showing the summary of the Luminous Vajra Essence Path, the eighteenth chapter.
[5955] Thus, having shown the actual path,
[5956] Now, regarding the path's difference: for great powers, the supreme means of freeing without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of cutting (Trekcho)—has three parts:
[5957] Cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point, || 30 ||
[5958] Binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point,
[5959] Clearing obstacles through cutting freedom-confidence at the point.
[5960] First has three:
[5961] Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort in the nature of great perfection.
[5962]
