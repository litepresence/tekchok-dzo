[9223] First, the essence of mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of great perfect nature, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[9224] When realizing that by sense-power,
[9225] When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, thus twelve portions.
[9226] From Power-Perfect:
[9227] At the time when mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[9228] Reach the end of great perfect view.
[9229] For best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three views arise.
[9230] For best sense-power, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising
[9231] Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[9232] At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean.
[9233] Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting sky-spear.
[9234] Fruit is seeing appearance of birthless self-arising.
[9235] The view of middle sense-power
[9236] Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[9237] Intention is free from concept portions, like flags attaching to ocean.

[9249] Second, the essence of wisdom's general filling intention:
[9250] Realizing awareness's power-empowerment perfected from the beginning.
[9251] Different manners of realizing by three sense-powers:
[9252] From that same source:
[9253] At the time when wisdom's general filling intention arises,
[9254] Also, by best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, three view manners arise.
[9255] Best sense-power realizes only by demonstrating birthless fruit as self-nature through empowerment.
[9256] Intention:
[9257] Through wisdom practice, spreading to bindu, unmoving from sky-equal great bliss intention.
[9258] Conduct:

[9278] Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[9279] Buddha-hood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[9280] Different by distinction of person's sense-power.
[9281] From that:
[9282] At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises,
[9283] Also, for best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three view-signs arise.
[9284] The view of best sense-power:

[9316] Separated individually by sense-power.
[9317] From Power-Perfect:

[9372] Third, summarizing meaning by aspect:
[9373] These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[9374] Arising of yogin's experience:
[9375] By mountain general meaning, transcending view of great perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[9376] By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding Dharma-nature in that manner.
[9377] By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[9378] By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.

### PAGE 219

[9385] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9386] The intention of mountain's general meaning
[9387] Is like lion's play.
[9388] The intention of wisdom's general filling
[9389] Is like empowerment from king's head.
[9390] The intention of bindu's range-penetration is like peacock chick emerging from egg.
[9391] The intention of sun-moon equal gap is like entering equality without sun and moon two.
[9392] The intention of ocean's expanse-penetration
[9393] Is like sun arising from mountain's neck. Thus it is spoken.
[9394] Thus, dividing each of the five aspirations into three sense-powers makes fifteen; dividing each of these into view, intention, conduct, and fruit fours makes sixty Dharma enumerations—purifying sixty enumerations of eon's increase-decrease, sentient beings' affliction, and view.
[9395] Demonstrated as pure complete nature of wisdom experience, spoken by Vajra-Holder.
[9396] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[9397] The twentieth chapter establishing the essential point of taking experience of spontaneous leap-over wisdom.
[9398] Thus having demonstrated all methods of taking experience through guidance method,
[9399] Now, extensively explaining the sequence of how to take experience through introduction, has two aspects:
[9400] Establishing all Dharmas by general introduction sequence,
[9401] And extensively explaining mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction.
[9402] First, the preparation preceding introduction:
[9403] From two actual introductions,
