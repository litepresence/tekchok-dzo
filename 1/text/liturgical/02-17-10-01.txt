[3307] First clear A, then that also not-existing, other thought not-changing, arise clear half-essence, meditate in that state.
[3308] These very important points by experience, with very great effort do.
[3309] Fifth, transference: three aspects.
[3310] Great: clear-light transference.
[3311] Medium: illusory-body transference.
[3312] Finally: body-speech transference.
[3313] That is not three transference places.
[3314] Three capacities of the transference-doer.
[3315] Some apply three transference, others do.
[3316] Here, if self masters clear-light, at death-time from that state extract awareness to the Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu.
[3317] If master illusory-body, at death-time from illusory-body state project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmata meaning deity-form, hold bardo illusory-body, buddha.
[3318] If those two not mastered, depend upon body-speech-mind three points channel-wind, transference to Brahma-aperture, and.

[3340] <tantra> If immediately do mind transference.
[3341] <tantra> Day like kill Brahmin, and.
[3342] <tantra> Also do five borderless.

[3344] Thus it is.
[3345] Sixth, two: union bardo instruction.
[3346] Point of union realization by practicing this life, and.
