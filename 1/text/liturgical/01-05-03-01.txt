[4671] EIGHT: EXPERT RITUAL TANTRAS
[4672] Relying on the one hundred eight chapters of the glorious black wrathful tantra:
[4673] Protects the supreme teachings.
[4674] These too, from the Pearl Garland:
[4675] Ah! Thus all tantras—
[4676] Supreme wonder, great!
[4677] Thus all meanings explained.
[4678] The tantra sequence:
[4679] The two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence.
[4680] The two explanatory mother and child tantras explain as leaves spreading.
[4681] The two limb tantras explain like planets and stars arising from oceans.
[4682] The two scripture-logic clear tantras explain like flowers opening.
[4683] The four upadesha tantras explain as ripening results.
[4684] The three intention-self-abiding tantras explain as seeing the peak.
[4685] The two entering-self-liberation tantras explain as mindful basis and heart.
[4686] The expert ritual tantras explain like a dog that does the messenger's work.
[4687] Thus,
[4688] The Reason for Establishing Eight Sections:
[4689] If the two root tantras are lacking:
[4690] Like a trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise.
[4691] If the two explanatory mother and child tantras are lacking:
[4692] Like no leaves from that—no flowers arise.
[4693] If the two limb tantras are lacking:
[4694] Like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls.
[4695] If the two entering-self-liberation tantras are lacking:
[4696] Like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others.
[4697] If the two scripture-logic clear tantras are lacking:
[4698] 
[4699] 
[4700] 
[4701] 


### PAGE 126

[4702] If no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time—like so.
[4703] If the four upadesha tantras are lacking:
[4704] If no results, agriculture is meaningless—like so.
[4705] If the three intention-self-abiding tantras are lacking:
[4706] Like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city.
[4707] If the expert ritual tantra is lacking:
[4708] Like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves.
[4709] Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete.
[4710] If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight.
[4711] If more than that: not needed.
[4712] The Name and Meaning of the Eight Sections Explained:
[4713] Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into rigpa.
[4714] Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings.
[4715] Branch: coiled like a trunk—intends non-duality of space and awareness.
[4716] Scripture-logic:

[4721] Expert ritual: complete upadesha scripture—intends protecting the holy teachings and abiding long.
[4722] Examining their letters: called "root"—dharma's root gathered into rigpa.
[4723] Rigpa's root: emptiness, nature, grasped and freed.
[4724] Holding that tantra: rigpa meets its own face.
[4725] Worn: samādhi abides in itself.
[4726] Read: expressed meanings appear in mind.
[4727] Explained: supreme and common siddhis obtained.  Meditated: samsara expelled.

[4748] Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual.
[4749] Self-liberated—uncontrived.

[4847] That also, from the manner of explanation method's two definite branches:
