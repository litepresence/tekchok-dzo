[2873] First: through reasoning that examines and dissects, when nothing is established as dharma-nature, wisdom that realizes all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature.
[2874] As the Two Truths state:
[2875] "Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate,
[2876] And thinking also accordant purpose."
[2877] When all elaborations of arising cease and peace is attained,
[2878] This is termed "the ultimate."
[2879] Thus.
[2880] Second:
[2881] Phenomena, primordial from the very beginning, transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence; their sphere of existence is pure by its very nature.
[2882] As the Root Wisdom states:
[2883] "Peace that is not known from elsewhere,
[2884] Conceptuality is nothing, meaning is not differentiated.
[2885] Non-elaboration through all elaborations."
[2886] This is its characteristic.
[2887] Thus.
[2888] Second: the stages of knowing and practicing.
[2889] Whether the bodhisattva householder has taken the vow of the lay practitioner or not, it is suitable.
[2890] If fully ordained, one enters the ten places of novice discipline.
[2891] The bhikshu discipline consists of two hundred and fifty.
[2892] Based upon the bhikshuni discipline of three hundred and sixty-three,
[2893] Generating the mind of great Vehicle aspiration and entering,
[2894] Abiding in the eighty-five training sutras,
[2895] The four establishments of mindfulness in the small path of accumulation,
[2896] The four correct abandonments in the medium path,
[2897] The four miraculous feet in the great path,
[2898] The five faculties of heat and peak in the path of preparation,
[2899] The five strengths of patience and supreme dharma in the peak path,
[2900] The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment in the path of seeing,
[2901] The eight aspects of the superior paths in the nine grounds of meditation,
[2902] Completing with complete signs of heat in the great joy of the ground-paths.



[2903] Manifesting the path of the non-learner.
[2904] Third: the fruit of complete perfection.
[2905] Upon the ground of all-illumination, for self-purpose, the dharma-body,
[2906] Having obtained the two supreme form-bodies for the benefit of others,
[2907] Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms,
[2908] Working for the benefit of beings until samsara is emptied.
[2909] As the Entrance states:
[2910] "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
[2911] Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought,
[2912] Working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained.
[2913] This is appearance free from elaboration."
[2914] Thus it is taught.
[2915] The manner of these, extensively:
[2916] From self-appearing awareness.
[2917] The bodhisattva vehicle:
[2918] The doors of entry are the two truths: the ultimate and the conventional.
[2919] The manner of protection: the limbs of discipline—
[2920] Eighty-four vows,
[2921] View and wisdom of emptiness.
[2922] The ultimate and conventional are thus:
[2923] The conventional is conceived in two aspects: the false and the truly correct.
[2924] The false conventional is thus: all imputed appearances.
[2925] They appear in accord but possess the power to function.
[2926] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence;
[2927] Meaning appears as if non-existent.
[2928] This is the false conventional.
[2929] The truly conventional is thus: the actions of the ten virtues,
[2930] The thoughts that become white,
[2931] The thoughts of faith to whatever extent—
[2932] Conceived as the truly conventional great:
[2933] Generosity, discipline, and so forth,
[2934] And concentration and so forth.
[2935] The truly conventional great.
[2936] The ultimate also has two aspects:
[2937] The nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate,
[2938] The truly mental ultimate.
[2939] By the nominal ultimate, all are refuted and debated.
[2940] That also is the reasoning of valid cognition:
[2941] Whatever that nature is, it appears as such.
[2942] The great emptiness of words—
[2943] The meaning is empty, yet not realized.
[2944] The nominal ultimate.
[2945] The truly mental ultimate:
[2946] Emptiness utterly without anything, one thinks to meditate—
[2947] Like the empty sky,
[2948] The meaning of emptiness is just suchness itself.
[2949] Emptiness is unceasing, limitless.
[2950] Thus one acts and attaches.
[2951] The path is thus conceived,
[2952] One thinks to purify upon the ground.
[2953] That also has heat, patience arises—
[2954] Peak, world, supreme dharma.
[2955] 
[2956] 
[2957] 
[2958] 
[2959] 



[2960] Through three aspects of heat, it is taught.
[2961] The outer, the inner, and both together.
[2962] The outer heat arises thus:
[2963] The second: from the stainless.
[2964] Entities appear as empty.
[2965] That is the practice of concentration.
[2966] It is taught to arise in the two pure grounds.
[2967] The inner heat is the sixth.
[2968] Understanding the pure knowable as empty.
[2969] The heat of both is thus.
[2970] Seventh: it is taught to arise from the pure.
[2971] Eighth: patience is attained.
[2972] Ninth: the peak is reached.
[2973] Tenth: supreme dharma of the world.
[2974] Similarly, the ten grounds are obtained.
[2975] This is the vehicle of enlightenment.
[2976] Emptiness beyond words and letters.
[2977] Utterly without, one thinks emptiness.
[2978] Thus it is said.
[2979] Second: The explanation of established tenet views, divided into two.
[2980] The explanation of the mind-only and middle-way traditions.
[2981] First: All these appearing as white and red various appearances with consciousness, asserted by the mind-only school as truly real in the aspect of one's own mind—the true aspect of mind-only.
[2982] The false aspect of consciousness asserted by mind-only as false—these two.
