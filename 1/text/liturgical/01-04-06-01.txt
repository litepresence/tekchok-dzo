[2873] First: through direct recognition that examines nothing and dissects nothing, when nothing is established as dharma-nature, wisdom that realizes all as primordially dwelling shines forth spontaneously.
[2874] As the Two Truths states:
<tantra> "Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate,
<tantra> And thinking also accordant purpose."
[2877] When all elaborations of arising cease into their own place and peace is recognized,
[2878] This is termed "the ultimate"—your own face, never hidden.
[2879] Thus it is pointed out.
[2880] Second:
[2881] Phenomena, primordial from the very beginning, transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence; their sphere is pure by its very nature—nothing ever obscured, nothing to purify.
[2882] As the Root Wisdom states: || 10 ||
<tantra> "Peace that is not known from elsewhere,
<tantra> Conceptuality is nothing, meaning is not differentiated.
<tantra> Non-elaboration through all elaborations."
[2886] This is its essential characteristic—rigpa's own state, never departing.
[2887] Thus it is taught.
[2888] Second: the recognition journey—not stages to traverse but recognition unfolding.
[2889] Whether one has taken formal vows or not, the path opens to those who recognize.
[2890] The discipline is not constraint but spontaneous virtuous conduct arising from recognition.
[2891] The precepts are not rules to follow but natural expressions of wisdom's play.
[2892] Recognition itself is the bodhisattva vow—|| 20 ||
[2893] The mind of Great Vehicle is already complete, never needing to be generated.
[2894] The trainings are not practices to accumulate but descriptions of recognition's unfolding.
[2895] The four establishments of mindfulness are direct seeing of rigpa's display.
[2896] The four correct abandonments are spontaneous self-liberation of confusion.
[2897] The four miraculous feet are the effortless play of awareness.
[2898] The five faculties and strengths are recognition's natural maturation.
[2899] The path is not traversed—it is recognized as already complete.
[2900] The seven limbs of enlightenment are rigpa's own qualities, spontaneously present.
[2901] The eightfold path is not a method but a description of how recognition functions.
[2902] All grounds and paths are recognized as the display of primordial perfection. || 30 ||
[2903] The non-learner's path is simply recognition without confusion.
[2904] Third: the fruition of self-perfection—nothing to attain.
[2905] The ground of all-illumination is rigpa's own nature, never other than what is.
[2906] The form-bodies are spontaneous display for beings' benefit, not results to achieve.
[2907] Beholding all with the two wisdoms is simply how rigpa functions, never departing from its own state.
[2908] Working for beings is spontaneous compassion, the natural display of recognition.
[2909] As the Entrance to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states:
<tantra> "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
<tantra> Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought,
<tantra> Working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained. || 40 ||
<tantra> This is appearance free from elaboration."
[2914] Thus it is taught.
[2915] The manner of these, extensively:
[2916] From self-appearing awareness—this alone.
[2917] The bodhisattva vehicle:
[2918] The doors of entry are recognition of the two truths as the play of rigpa.
[2919] The manner of protection: natural discipline of awareness—
[2920] No vows to keep, only recognition to maintain.
[2921] View and wisdom of emptiness are your own face, never hidden.
[2922] The ultimate and conventional are thus: || 50 ||
[2923] The conventional is conceived in two aspects: the false and the truly correct.
[2924] The false conventional: look—appearances are illusory display, never substantial.
[2925] They appear while being empty—this is the play.
[2926] When you look directly, nothing is found—empty by its very nature.
[2927] Meaning appears as if non-existent, yet clarity is never lost.
[2928] This is the false conventional—spontaneous display, nothing to reject.
[2929] The truly conventional: the actions of virtue arise naturally from recognition.
[2930] White thoughts are not cultivated—they arise spontaneously as wisdom's play.
[2931] Faith is recognition of your own nature—not something to develop.
[2932] Conceived as the truly conventional great: || 60 ||
[2933] Generosity, discipline, and so forth—
[2934] And concentration and so forth—all are spontaneous expressions.
[2935] The truly conventional great.
[2936] The ultimate also has two aspects:
[2937] The nominal ultimate—conceptual understanding,
[2938] And the truly mental ultimate—direct recognition.
[2939] By the nominal ultimate, all are refuted and debated—merely intellectual.
[2940] That also is the reasoning of valid cognition:
[2941] Whatever that nature is, it appears as such.
[2942] The great emptiness of words— || 70 ||
[2943] The meaning is empty, yet not realized through thinking.
[2944] The nominal ultimate—conceptual approximation.
[2945] The truly mental ultimate:
[2946] Emptiness utterly without anything—look now, this very moment.
[2947] Like the empty sky, yet clarity is unceasing.
[2948] The meaning of emptiness is just suchness itself—your own rigpa.
[2949] Emptiness is unceasing, limitless—spontaneous perfection.
[2950] Thus one recognizes and is liberated in the same instant.
[2951] The path is thus conceived—not to be traversed but recognized.
[2952] One thinks to purify upon the ground—yet the ground was never stained. || 80 ||
[2953] That also has heat, patience arises—
[2954] Peak, world, supreme dharma—all are spontaneous unfoldings of recognition.
[2955] Ultimate meaning signs are made—pointing to what is already complete.
[2956] Thus it is.
[2957] Second:
[2958] Phenomena, primordially beyond existence and non-existence elaborations, the expanse primordially pure by nature—recognize this as your own face.
[2959] From the Root of Wisdom:
[2960] Through three aspects of heat, it is taught.
[2961] The outer, the inner, and both together.
[2962] The outer heat arises thus: || 90 ||
[2963] The second: from the stainless ground of rigpa.
[2964] Entities appear as empty—look and see, nothing to find.
[2965] That is the practice of concentration—not something to do but to recognize.
[2966] It is taught to arise in the two pure grounds—recognition's unfolding.
[2967] The inner heat is recognition's deepening.
[2968] Understanding the pure knowable as empty—not understanding but seeing directly.
[2969] The heat of both is thus—outer and inner are never two.
[2970] Seventh: it is taught to arise from the pure—recognition maturing.
[2971] Eighth: patience is attained—not patience developed but patience recognized.
[2972] Ninth: the peak is reached—not a peak to reach but the natural state. || 100 ||
[2973] Tenth: supreme dharma of the world—complete recognition.
[2974] Similarly, the ten grounds are obtained—not obtained but recognized as spontaneously present.
[2975] This is the vehicle of enlightenment—not a vehicle to enter but what is already complete.
[2976] Emptiness beyond words and letters—look directly, this very moment.
[2977] Utterly without, one recognizes emptiness—never empty of clarity.
[2978] Thus it is said.
[2979] Second: The explanation of established views as recognition, divided into two.
[2980] The explanation of the mind-only and middle-way traditions.
[2981] First: All these appearing as white and red various appearances with consciousness—recognize them as the play of your own rigpa, never other than the true aspect of mind. || 110 ||
[2982] The false aspect of consciousness—recognize even confusion as wisdom's display, never truly separate.
