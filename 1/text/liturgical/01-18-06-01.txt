[4696] Like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others.
[4697] If the two scripture-logic clear tantras are lacking:
[4702] If no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time—like so.
[4703] If the four upadesha tantras are lacking:
[4704] If no results, agriculture is meaningless—like so.
[4705] If the three intention-self-abiding tantras are lacking:
[4706] Like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city.
[4707] If the expert ritual Tantra is lacking:
[4708] Like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves.
[4709] Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete.
[4710] If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight.
[4711] If more than that: not needed.
[4712] The Name and Meaning of the Eight Sections Explained:
[4713] Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into Rigpa.
[4714] Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings.
[4715] Branch: coiled like a trunk—intends non-duality of space and awareness.
[4716] Scripture-logic:
[4717] Clear like a flower—intends holding and showing the lamp's self-face.
[4718] Upadesha: ripening like results—intends making Three Kāyas into paths.
[4719] Intention self-abiding: liberation path seeing—intends making results into paths.
[4720] Entering self-liberation: mindfulness-awareness path cultivated, courageous ones—intends showing the lamp's very self-face.
[4721] Expert ritual: complete upadesha scripture—intends protecting the holy teachings and abiding long.
[4722] Examining their letters: called "root"—Dharma's root gathered into Rigpa.
[4723] Rigpa's root: emptiness, nature, grasped and freed.
[4724] Holding that Tantra: Rigpa meets its own face.
[4725] Worn: Samādhi abides in itself.
[4726] Read: expressed meanings appear in mind.
[4727] Explained: supreme and common siddhis obtained.  Meditated: samsara expelled.
[4728] Listening, exercising the wisdom of the state.
[4729] Upadesha elaboration, word-upadesha cast into words—meaning does not reach immediately.
[4730] Essence-gathered meaning-upadesha, without depending on words—buddhahood.
[4731] Upadesha expression depending:
[4732] Inexpressible awareness-meaning arises in Tantra.
[4733] Explanation words:
[4734] Depending on elaboration of words—demonstrates wisdom free of elaboration.
[4735] Intention:
[4736] Dharmatā transcending intervals, without gap.
[4737] That self-abiding, not arising from other.
[4738] Scripture:
[4739] Unchanging, stable—confidence arises.
[4740] Awareness:
[4741] Depending on that meaning—liberates to the Buddha level.
[4742] Clarity:
[4743] Knowledge clear—abides nowhere.
[4744] Faculty clear—distinguishes Dharma and non-Dharma.
[4745] Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble.
[4746] Holding those—transcend the Three Realms.
