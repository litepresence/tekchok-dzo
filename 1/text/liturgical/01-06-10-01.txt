[8841] <list> First—the spontaneous recognition of four kayas:
[8842] The four kayas are naturally recognized, not bestowed from outside.
[8843] Elaborate: recognize body aggregate as Dharmakāya—never other than awareness.
[8844] Speech: recognize mantra as spontaneous sound—no speaker, no spoken.
[8845] Mind: recognize samādhi as natural presence—no meditation, no meditator.
[8846] Consciousness: recognize dharmatā as your own face—never obscured.
[8847] Unelaborate: appearance outside, illusion-empty—this very perception is the kaya.
[8848] Very unelaborate: four activities join in spontaneous recognition.
[8849] Utterly unelaborate: body—bliss of natural awareness;
[8850] Speech—clarity, unobstructed; || 10 ||
[8851] Mind—not-think, yet perfectly knowing;
[8852] Consciousness—union, power-possessing, naturally doing.
[8853] <list> Second—four kayas naturally recognized, mind changes not:
[8854] Capable mind recognizes: this very thought is Dharmakāya.
[8855] Inside enters: recognition shows the method is no method.
[8856] Mind-change thought purifies—recognition joins with itself.
[8857] Utterly unelaborate: non-dual meaning obtained—not found, but recognized.
[8858] <list> Third—four kayas action-limit spontaneously liberates:
[8859] Elaborate action, verse, syllable, thought—body, speech, mind, consciousness four bliss gives.
[8860] Recognition arises, || 20 ||
[8861] Conduct self-arises from nowhere,
[8862] Meaning self-arrives—dharmatā never goes, never comes.
[8863] Emptiness enters as maṇḍala—three doors, three realms: pure recognition.
[8864] Six collections purify: this very recognition is the purification.
[8865] <list> Fourth—four kayas naturally recognized, utterly certain:
[8866] Whatever attachment-aversion—self-liberates in recognition.
[8867] Nirmāṇakāya recognized: aggregates, elements, sense-sources—empty yet appearing.
[8868] Saṃbhogakāya recognized: mind come-go not, meaning realizes itself.
[8869] Dharmakāya prophecy—Saṃsāra-Nirvāṇa attachment, knowledge, obscuration: subtle recognition purifies all. || 30 ||
[8870] <list> Second, self-face naturally recognized—four kayas of awareness.
[8871] <list> These are not empowerments given—they are kayas recognized, your own nature from the beginning.
[8872] The four kayas are not achievements. They are recognition of what already is.
