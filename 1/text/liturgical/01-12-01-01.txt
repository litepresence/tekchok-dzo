[13831] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[13832] <tantra> "From channels the bindus—
[13833] <tantra> Subtle and quick, essence-possessing,
[13834] <tantra> By light rays themselves made beautiful.
[13835] <tantra> These three parts:
[13836] <tantra> Right, left, and middle."
[13837] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.

[13838] Here explained are those meanings.

[13839] The three chief channels are:
[13840] <list> Roma,
[13841] <list> Rkyangma,
[13842] <list> Kun'darma.

[13843] First, regarding Roma:
[13844] Taking all tastes, like salt—
[13845] Depending on bindu-bliss, uncommon enjoyment arises;
[13846] Thus called "taste" (*ro*).
[13847] From desire-attachment as cause it arose;
[13848] Thus called "ma" (mother).
[13849] The desire-attachment possessor, depending on that, becomes Buddha.

[13850] Alternatively: Taste performs few actions,
[13851] Depending on bindu-confusion, experience difficult to express;
[13852] Thus called "ma."

[13853] From within that, the relative bindu moves—
[13854] Method's nature-possessing.

[13855] Rkyangma is:
[13856] Not crooked, without branches,
[13857] Straight hollow—thus called.
[13858] From the nature of both ultimate bindu and relative bindu as cause,
[13859] Ultimate elements and
[13860] Relative elements mature and separate—thus it causes.
[13861] Straight, thus unchanging.
[13862] All's basis, thus called "mo."
[13863] Depending on this, without effort one becomes Buddha.

[13864] Kun'darma is called:
[13865] Gathering all,
[13866] Depending on this, bindu and
[13867] Channel-bliss and
[13868] Wind-bliss all arise—thus "ku" (all).
[13869] Pervading the general, thus called "darma."

[13870] Regarding their locations:

[13871] Roma:
[13872] From the navel's left, coils,
[13873] All from the right moves.

[13874] Rkyangma:
[13875] From the heart peak's left exits,
[13876] From the throat channel-net exits,
[13877] From the cranium's inside returns and enters,
[13878] The left eye's door opens.

[13879] Roma:
[13880] From the right eye.

[13881] Kun'darma:
[13882] Abides straight in the center,
[13883] Three peaks branched,
[13884] Door at the central crown Brahma-aperture making light,
[13885] Then awareness thought-free body arises.

[13886] The right peak: right ear light,
[13887] Karma wind moves.
[13888] Its branch, subtle, two nostrils pierce,
[13889] Karma wind doing and together moves—
[13890] Wind enters Avadhuti and wind-concentration meditation support does.

[13891] Left ear one peak pierced,
[13892] From that wisdom wind arises.

[13893] Left channel: nature bindu.
[13894] Right channel: conventional bindu.

[13895] Depending on right conventional bindu,
[13896] Body ripening does.
[13897] That itself: body bliss and suffering and equanimity and
[13898] Elements growing and deteriorating—such action does.

[13899] Upon that, four subtle knots exist:
[13900] <list> Navel,
[13901] <list> Heart,
[13902] <list> Throat,
[13903] <list> Crown—four.

[13904] First, the cause-producing channel produced.
[13905] Channel's inside: father's cause bindu,
[13906] White mustard-seed ten-divided portion only abides.
[13907] Depending on that, body upward growing born;
[13908] Thus "cause" called.

[13909] From blood comes flesh,
[13910] From flesh comes tendon,
[13911] From tendon comes lymph,
[13912] From lymph comes bile,
[13913] From bile comes fat,
[13914] From fat comes bone,
[13915] From bone comes marrow,
[13916] From marrow comes nerves,
[13917] From nerves comes conventional bindu—thus maturation.

[13918] Regarding Rkyangma's knot:
[13919] Like this it generates:
[13920] Far-reaching water lamp's seed,
[13921] Pupil very shining, two abodes.

[13922] Regarding recollection:
[13923] Wisdom self-arisen lamp's support,
[13924] Fire bindu very radiating abides.

[13925] Regarding tastes-all:
[13926] Increasing wisdom lamp's support,
[13927] Earth bindu very gathering abides.

[13928] Regarding Avadhuti:
[13929] Abiding butter lamp's support,
[13930] Wind bindu very moving abides.

[13931] Thus lamps four support.
[13932] Three channels' bindu.

[13933] From Rkyangma three bindus separate,
[13934] From three channels' bindus,
[13935] Upper body above from heart gathering,
[13936] Lower body below from navel gathering.

[13937] White smooth surface lamp heart-in located,
[13938] White smooth surface support-from Avadhuti five lights very gathering.

[13939] Lamp increasing wisdom appearances navel-in located,
[13940] Lamp increasing support-from Roma and Rkyangma gathering-from fire bindu radiating.

[13941] Far-reaching water lamp throat-in located,
[13942] Far-reaching support-from Roma and Kun'darma gathering-from water bindu moving.

[13943] Abiding butter lamp crown-in located,
[13944] Abiding support-from three channels gathering-from wind bindu moving.

[13945] Regarding explanation:
[13946] Heart's center five colors' bindu,
[13947] White, red, black three inside,
[13948] Five colors five directions abiding,
[13949] This also eye's pupil-in located,
[13950] Very shining, far-reaching water lamp called.

[13951] The same bindu mother-and-son mixed,
[13952] Mother prajna, son means,
[13953] From their mixing Avadhuti's top-in very white,
[13954] Crown aperture light very radiating,
[13955] Abiding butter lamp called.

[13956] Earth and wind gathering navel-in very gathering,
[13957] Increasing wisdom lamp called.
[13958] Thus support called.
[13959] Channels three thus lamps four thus.

[13960] First, regarding channels' distinctions—
[13961] Principal and minor two.

[13962] Regarding principal channels:
[13963] <list> Avadhuti,
[13964] <list> Roma,
[13965] <list> Rkyangma,
[13966] <list> Kun'darma.

[13967] Regarding minor channels:
[13968] All body-pervading.
[13969] Principal four minor 72,000.

[13970] Their functions explained:
[13971] Avadhuti all body upper lower pervades,
[13972] Wind and mind dwelling place.
[13973] Eighty-four thousand doors of love etc.
[13974] Concern-love-doing wind 84,000,
[13975] Principal one Avadhuti and minor two.
[13976] These branches to smallest finger-tip pervade.

[13977] All body-pervading.
[13978] Avadhuti life-sustaining wind support-from mind basis-of-consciousness causes.
[13979] Mind basis-of-consciousness Avadhuti body-pervades.
[13980] Life-sustaining and Avadhuti equal,
[13981] Wind and mind non-separate,
[13982] Thus body ceases when separate.

[13983] Mind's mounts wind five.
[13984] Those Avadhuti and others depending,
[13985] Avadhuti principal,
[13986] Branch-roots minor channels.

[13987] Avadhuti winds' mansion is.
[13988] Without that wind not-arise,
[13989] Roma etc. that on depends.
[13990] That from branches pervading.

[13991] Regarding general location:
[13992] Chakras four,
[13993] Channels groups or wheels said.
[13994] Upper navel,
[13995] Lower secret,
[13996] At navel dharma wheel sixty-four petals,
[13997] Center bindu triangle.

[13998] Above heart wheel eight petals,
[13999] At center bindu called dharmata.

[14000] Above throat wheel sixteen petals,
[14001] Center bindu called enjoyment.

[14002] Above head wheel thirty-two petals,
[14003] Center bindu called spontaneous presence.

[14004] Thus chakras four.
[14005] Others from those four emanated.

[14006] Regarding principal and minor channels explanation,
[14007] From four elements body originated,
[14008] From body channels originated,
[14009] From channels wind originated,
[14010] From wind mind originated.
[14011] Thus basis six elements.

[14012] Regarding knot locations:
[14013] Avadhuti knots four at,
[14014] Navel and heart and throat and crown.
[14015] Roma knot right navel-in,
[14016] Rkyangma left.
[14017] Knots thus six.
[14018] From those emanated branches.

[14019] Regarding Avadhuti's knot explanation:
[14020] Avadhuti knot heart-in,
[14021] Knot two channel-walls holding.
[14022] Wind knots-in enters not-able,
[14023] There light bindu gathering.
[14024] White smooth surface lamp's support-called.

[14025] Thus knots four.
[14026] First navel's knot:
[14027] That Roma and Rkyangma very wind moving,
[14028] Avadhuti's wall pressing,
[14029] Navel's channel-wall at three channel-knot made.

[14042] From that light bindu emanating,
[14043] Abiding butter lamp called.
[14044] Thus knots five.

[14045] Regarding knot manner explanation,
[14046] Those knots two ways:
[14047] Nature knot and temporary knot.

[14048] Nature knot:
[14049] First navel's knot,
[14050] Second heart's knot,
[14051] These two nature knots.

[14052] Temporary knot:
