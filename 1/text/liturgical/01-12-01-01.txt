[13831] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[13832] <verse> "From channels the bindus,
[13833] <verse> Subtle and quick, essence-possessing,
[13834] <verse> By light rays themselves made beautiful."

[13835] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.

[13836] Here explained are those meanings.

[13837] The three chief channels are:
<list> [13838] Roma,
<list> [13839] Rkyangma,
<list> [13840] Kun'darma.

[13841] First, regarding Roma:
[13842] Taking all tastes, like salt—
[13843] Depending on bindu-bliss, uncommon enjoyment arises;
[13844] Thus called "taste" (ro).
[13845] From desire-attachment as cause it arose;
[13846] Thus called "ma" (mother).
[13847] The desire-attachment possessor, depending on that, becomes Buddha.

[13848] Alternatively: Taste performs few actions,
[13849] Depending on bindu-confusion, experience difficult to express;
[13850] Thus called "ma."

[13851] From within that, the relative bindu moves—
[13852] Method's nature-possessing.

[13853] Rkyangma is:
[13854] Not crooked, without branches,
[13855] Straight hollow—thus called.
[13856] From the nature of both ultimate bindu and relative bindu as cause,
[13857] Ultimate elements and
[13858] Relative elements mature and separate—thus it causes.
[13859] Straight, thus unchanging.
[13860] All's basis, thus called "mo."
[13861] Depending on this, without effort one becomes Buddha.

[13862] Kun'darma is called:
[13863] Gathering all,
[13864] Depending on this, bindu and
[13865] Channel-bliss and
[13866] Wind-bliss all arise—thus "ku" (all).
[13867] Pervading the general, thus called "darma."

[13868] Regarding their locations:

[13869] Roma:
[13870] From the navel's left, coils,
[13871] All from the right moves.

[13872] Rkyangma:
[13873] From the heart peak's left exits,
[13874] From the throat channel-net exits,
[13875] From the cranium's inside returns and enters,
[13876] The left eye's door opens.

[13877] Roma:
[13878] From the right eye.

[13879] Kun'darma:
[13880] Abides straight in the center,
[13881] Three peaks branched,
[13882] Door at the central crown Brahma-aperture making light,
[13883] Then awareness thought-free body arises.

[13884] The right peak: right ear light,
[13885] Karma wind moves.
[13886] Its branch, subtle, two nostrils pierce,
[13887] Karma wind doing and together moves—
[13888] Wind enters Avadhuti and wind-concentration meditation support does.

[13889] Left ear one peak pierced,
[13890] From that wisdom wind arises.

[13891] Left channel: nature bindu.
[13892] Right channel: conventional bindu.

[13893] Depending on right conventional bindu,
[13894] Body ripening does.
[13895] That itself: body bliss and suffering and equanimity and
[13896] Elements growing and deteriorating—such action does.

[13897] Upon that, four subtle knots exist:
<list> [13898] Navel,
<list> [13899] Heart,
<list> [13900] Throat,
<list> [13901] Crown—four.

[13902] First, the cause-producing channel produced.
[13903] Channel's inside: father's cause bindu,
[13904] White mustard-seed ten-divided portion only abides.
[13905] Depending on that, body upward growing born;
[13906] Thus "cause" called.

[13907] Memory is:
[13908] Mother's condition bindu red,
[13909] Mustard-seed's tenth portion abide from
[13910] Memory-by-means-of various-to become's support-to abide from memory called.

[13911] Taste all-in:
[13912] Wind's bindu mustard-seed's tenth portion-to abide,
[13913] That-by-means-of pure impure separate make,
[13914] Impure bile precious bile etcetera out throw and
[13915] Pure-by-means-of body's radiance and glow produce from taste called.

[13916] Peak-in:
[13917] Mind's nature light's bindu mustard-seed's tenth portion-to abide from tip called.
[13918] That conventional-of support called.

[13919] That move from body mind two separate become.
[13920] Conventional-of cause that from blood-to ripen and

[13921] Blood-from flesh,
[13922] Flesh-from tendon,
[13923] Tendon-from lymph,
[13924] Lymph-from fat,
[13925] Fat-from bone,
[13926] Bone-from marrow,
[13927] Marrow-from sinew,
[13928] Sinew-from relative's bindu-to mature is.

[13929] Regarding Rkyangma's knot:
[13930] Like this it generates:
[13931] Far-reaching water lamp's seed,
[13932] Pupil very shining, two abodes.

[13933] Regarding recollection:
[13934] Wisdom self-arisen lamp's support,
[13935] Fire bindu very radiating abides.

[13936] Regarding tastes-all:
[13937] Increasing wisdom lamp's support,
[13938] Earth bindu very gathering abides.

[13939] Regarding Avadhuti:
[13940] Abiding butter lamp's support,
[13941] Wind bindu very moving abides.

[13942] Thus lamps four support.
[13943] Three channels' bindu.

[13944] From Rkyangma three bindus separate,
[13945] From three channels' bindus,
[13946] Upper body above from heart gathering,
[13947] Lower body below from navel gathering.

[13948] White smooth surface lamp heart-in located,
[13949] White smooth surface support-from Avadhuti five lights very gathering.

[13950] Lamp increasing wisdom appearances navel-in located,
[13951] Lamp increasing support-from Roma and Rkyangma gathering-from fire bindu radiating.

[13952] Far-reaching water lamp throat-in located,
[13953] Far-reaching support-from Roma and Kun'darma gathering-from water bindu moving.

[13954] Abiding butter lamp crown-in located,
[13955] Abiding support-from three channels gathering-from wind bindu moving.

[13956] Regarding explanation:
[13957] Heart's center five colors' bindu,
[13958] White, red, black three inside,
[13959] Five colors five directions abiding,
[13960] This also eye's pupil-in located,
[13961] Very shining, far-reaching water lamp called.

[13962] The same bindu mother-and-son mixed,
[13963] Mother prajna, son means,
[13964] From their mixing Avadhuti's top-in very white,
[13965] Crown aperture light very radiating,
[13966] Abiding butter lamp called.

[13967] Earth and wind gathering navel-in very gathering,
[13968] Increasing wisdom lamp called.
[13969] Thus support called.
[13970] Channels three thus lamps four thus.

[13971] First, regarding channels' distinctions—
[13972] Principal and minor two.

[13973] Regarding principal channels:
<list> [13974] Avadhuti,
<list> [13975] Roma,
<list> [13976] Rkyangma,
<list> [13977] Kun'darma.

[13978] Regarding minor channels:
[13979] All body-pervading.
[13980] Principal four minor 72,000.

[13981] Their functions explained:
[13982] Avadhuti all body upper lower pervades,
[13983] Wind and mind dwelling place.
[13984] Eighty-four thousand doors of love etc.
[13985] Concern-love-doing wind 84,000,
[13986] Principal one Avadhuti and minor two.
[13987] These branches to smallest finger-tip pervade.

[13988] All body-pervading.
[13989] Avadhuti life-sustaining wind support-from mind basis-of-consciousness causes.
[13990] Mind basis-of-consciousness Avadhuti body-pervades.
[13991] Life-sustaining and Avadhuti equal,
[13992] Wind and mind non-separate,
[13993] Thus body ceases when separate.

[13994] Mind's mounts wind five.
[13995] Those Avadhuti and others depending,
[13996] Avadhuti principal,
[13997] Branch-roots minor channels.

[13998] Avadhuti winds' mansion is.
[13999] Without that wind not-arise,
[14000] Roma etc. that on depends.
[14001] That from branches pervading.

[14002] Regarding general location:
[14003] Chakras four,
[14004] Channels groups or wheels said.
[14005] Upper navel,
[14006] Lower secret,
[14007] At navel dharma wheel sixty-four petals,
[14008] Center bindu triangle.

[14009] Above heart wheel eight petals,
[14010] At center bindu called dharmata.

[14011] Above throat wheel sixteen petals,
[14012] Center bindu called enjoyment.

[14013] Above head wheel thirty-two petals,
[14014] Center bindu called spontaneous presence.

[14015] Thus chakras four.
[14016] Others from those four emanated.

[14017] Regarding principal and minor channels explanation,
[14018] From four elements body originated,
[14019] From body channels originated,
[14020] From channels wind originated,
[14021] From wind mind originated.
[14022] Thus basis six elements.

[14023] Regarding knot locations:
[14024] Avadhuti knots four at,
[14025] Navel and heart and throat and crown.
[14026] Roma knot right navel-in,
[14027] Rkyangma left.
[14028] Knots thus six.
[14029] From those emanated branches.

[14030] Regarding Avadhuti's knot explanation:
[14031] Avadhuti knot heart-in,
[14032] Knot two channel-walls holding.
[14033] Wind knots-in enters not-able,
[14034] There light bindu gathering.
[14035] White smooth surface lamp's support-called.

[14036] Thus knots four.
[14037] First navel's knot:
[14038] That Roma and Rkyangma very wind moving,
[14039] Avadhuti's wall pressing,
[14040] Navel's channel-wall at three channel-knot made.
[14041] That also knot-in wind enters not-able,
[14042] There light bindu gathering,
[14043] Increasing wisdom lamp called.

[14044] Third heart's knot:
[14045] From heart right left Roma and Rkyangma,
[14046] Avadhuti's wall pressing,
[14047] White smooth surface lamp's knot called.

[14048] Fourth throat's knot:
[14049] Similarly throat-in three channel-knot.
[14050] From that abiding butter lamp called.

[14051] Fifth crown's knot:
[14052] Avadhuti and Roma etc. crown's aperture touching,
[14053] From that light bindu emanating,
[14054] Abiding butter lamp called.
[14055] Thus knots five.

[14056] Regarding knot manner explanation,
[14057] Those knots two ways:
[14058] Nature knot and temporary knot.

[14059] Nature knot:
[14060] First navel's knot,
[14061] Second heart's knot,
[14062] These two nature knots.

[14063] Temporary knot:
[14064] Throat and crown knots,
[14065] Breaking possible.

[14066] Thus distinctions.

[14067] Regarding channel origins:
[14068] From four elements body originated,
[14069] From body channels originated,
[14070] From channels wind originated,
[14071] From wind mind originated.
[14072] Thus body-mind six elements.

[14073] Regarding channel functions:
[14074] Roma body action does,
[14075] Rkyangma speech action does,
[14076] Kun'darma mind action does.

[14077] These three channels:
[14078] Body basis, speech basis, mind basis.
[14079] From these all body functions.

[14080] Three channels three bindus:
[14081] Roma conventional bindu,
[14082] Rkyangma ultimate bindu,
[14083] Kun'darma both.

[14084] These three:
[14085] Method, wisdom, non-dual.
[14086] Thus three channels essence.

[14087] From body, channels arise.
[14088] From channels, winds arise.
[14089] From winds, bindus arise.
[14090] From bindus, bliss arises.

[14091] Body-bliss, speech-bliss, mind-bliss.
[14092] These three, ultimate bliss door.

[14093] From three channels three bindus,
[14094] From three bindus four lamps,
[14095] From four lamps four visions,
[14096] From four visions four kayas.

[14097] Thus channels-winds-bindus
[14098] Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—
[14099] Three kayas spontaneously present.

[14100] Channels essence empty,
[14101] Winds nature clear,
[14102] Bindus quality bliss.
[14103] Thus three natures one taste.

[14104] Empty-clear-bliss:
[14105] Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya.
[14106] Thus three kayas spontaneously present.

[14107] Channels thus explained.

[14108] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[14109] <verse> "Body's vital point is channel,
[14110] <verse> Abode and arrangement, movement and
