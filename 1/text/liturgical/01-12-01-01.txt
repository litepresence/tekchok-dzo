[13831] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[13832] <tantra> "From channels the bindus—
[13833] <tantra> Subtle and quick, essence-possessing,
[13834] <tantra> By light rays themselves made beautiful.
[13835] <tantra> These three parts:
[13836] <tantra> Right, left, and middle."
[13837] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.

[13838] Here explained are those meanings.

[13839] The three chief channels are:
[13840] <list> Roma,
[13841] <list> Rkyangma,
[13842] <list> Kun'darma.

[13843] First, regarding Roma:
[13844] Taking all tastes, like salt—
[13845] Depending on bindu-bliss, uncommon enjoyment arises;
[13846] Thus called "taste" (*ro*).
[13847] From desire-attachment as cause it arose;
[13848] Thus called "ma" (mother).
[13849] The desire-attachment possessor, depending on that, becomes Buddha.

[13850] Alternatively: Taste performs few actions,
[13851] Depending on bindu-confusion, experience difficult to express;
[13852] Thus called "ma."

[13853] From within that, the relative bindu moves—
[13854] Method's nature-possessing.

[13855] Rkyangma is:
[13856] Not crooked, without branches,
[13857] Straight hollow—thus called.
[13858] From the nature of both ultimate bindu and relative bindu as cause,
[13859] Ultimate elements and
[13860] Relative elements mature and separate—thus it causes.
[13861] Straight, thus unchanging.
[13862] All's basis, thus called "mo."
[13863] Depending on this, without effort one becomes Buddha.

[13864] Kun'darma is called:
[13865] Gathering all,
[13866] Depending on this, bindu and
[13867] Channel-bliss and
[13868] Wind-bliss all arise—thus "ku" (all).
[13869] Pervading the general, thus called "darma."

[13870] Regarding their locations:

[13871] Roma:
[13872] From the navel's left, coils,
[13873] All from the right moves.

[13874] Rkyangma:
[13875] From the heart peak's left exits,
[13876] From the throat channel-net exits,
[13877] From the cranium's inside returns and enters,
[13878] The left eye's door opens.

[13879] Roma:
[13880] From the right eye.

[13881] Kun'darma:
[13882] Abides straight in the center,
[13883] Three peaks branched,
[13884] Door at the central crown Brahma-aperture making light,
[13885] Then awareness thought-free body arises.

[13886] The right peak: right ear light,
[13887] Karma wind moves.
[13888] Its branch, subtle, two nostrils pierce,
[13889] Karma wind doing and together moves—
[13890] Wind enters Avadhuti and wind-concentration meditation support does.

[13891] Left ear one peak pierced,
[13892] From that wisdom wind arises.

[13893] Left channel: nature bindu.
[13894] Right channel: conventional bindu.

[13895] Depending on right conventional bindu,
[13896] Body ripening does.
[13897] That itself: body bliss and suffering and equanimity and
[13898] Elements growing and deteriorating—such action does.

[13899] Upon that, four subtle knots exist:
[13900] <list> Navel,
[13901] <list> Heart,
[13902] <list> Throat,
[13903] <list> Crown—four.

[13904] First, the cause-producing channel produced.
[13905] Channel's inside: father's cause bindu,
[13906] White mustard-seed ten-divided portion only abides.
[13907] Depending on that, body upward growing born;
[13908] Thus "cause" called.

[13909] From blood comes flesh,
[13910] From flesh comes tendon,
[13911] From tendon comes lymph,
[13912] From lymph comes fat,
[13913] From fat comes bone,
[13914] From bone comes marrow,
[13915] From marrow comes sinew,
[13916] From sinew comes relative bindu—thus maturation.

[13917] Regarding Rkyangma's knot:
[13918] Like this it generates:
[13919] Far-reaching water lamp's seed,
[13920] Pupil very shining, two abodes.

[13926] Earth bindu very gathering abides.

[13927] Regarding Avadhuti:
[13928] Abiding butter lamp's support,
[13929] Wind bindu very moving abides.

[13930] Thus lamps four support.
[13931] Three channels' bindu.

[13932] From Rkyangma three bindus separate,
[13933] From three channels' bindus,
[13934] Upper body above from heart gathering,
[13935] Lower body below from navel gathering.
