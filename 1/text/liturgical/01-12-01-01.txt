[13831] <prose><tantra>THE NATURE OF CHANNELS: General Exposition
[13832] <prose><tantra>Particular Classifications Explained
[13833] <prose><tantra>How to Apply in Practice
[13834] The first:
[13835] <prose><tantra>From the Pearl Garland:
[13836] From the channels come the bindus,
[13837] Of radiance and vibrating nature,
[13838] <prose><tantra>Adorned with rays of light.
[13839] <prose><tantra>Moreover, they are of three parts:
[13840] <prose><tantra>Right, left, and central. || 10 ||
[13841] <prose><tantra>Thus it is stated.
[13842] Here, when explaining their meaning:
[13843] The three principal channels are:
[13844] Roma,
[13845] Kyangma,
[13846] And Kundarma.
[13847] Moreover, Roma:
[13848] Since it extracts the flavor of all, it is like salt—
[13849] Experiencing the bliss of bindu generates uncommon experience, hence "flavor."
[13850] Since it arises from desire, it is called "ma" (mother)— || 20 ||
[13851] Relying on the desirous one, one becomes a Buddha.
[13852] Alternatively, "ro" (flavor) means few activities—depending on the illusion of bindu, the experience is difficult to express, hence "ma."
[13853] Within it, the relative bindu moves, being of the nature of means.
[13854] Kyangma:
[13855] Without crookedness or branches, it is called "straight hollow."
[13856] From the cause of both ultimate and relative bindus,
[13857] The ultimate arising,
[13858] And the relative arising are ripened and separated.
[13859] Being straight, it is unchanging.
[13860] Being the foundation of all, it is called "mo" (female). || 30 ||
[13861] Relying on this, one becomes Buddha without effort.
[13862] Kundarma:
[13863] The gathering of all—
[13864] Relying on this, bindu,
[13865] Channel bliss,
[13866] And wind bliss all arise, hence "ku."
[13867] Pervading all generally, it is called "darma."
[13868] Moreover, Roma:
[13869] From the left of the navel it coils, circulating to the right.
[13870] Kyangma: || 40 ||
[13871] Emerging from the left of the heart's tip,
[13872] Emanating from the throat channel network,
[13873] Entering inward through the skull, opening the gate at the left eye.
[13874] Roma:
[13875] From the right eye.
[13876] Kundarma:
[13877] Resides straight in the center,
[13878] Branching into three tips, making visible the central gate at Brahma's aperture at the crown.
[13879] From there, the body of awareness without thought dawns.
[13880] The right tip enters the right ear, || 50 ||
[13881] Moving the karma wind.
[13882] Its two subtle branches pierce both nostrils, moving together with the karma wind,
[13883] Wind enters Avadhuti, serving as the support for meditating on wind samadhi.
[13884] One tip enters the left ear, from there causing the wisdom wind to dawn.
[13885] In the left channel is the natural bindu,
[13886] In the right is the relative bindu.
[13887] Moreover, the right relies on the relative bindu to ripen the body.
[13888] Through that very means, the body performs the activities of bliss, suffering, equanimity,
[13889] And the increase and decrease of elements.
[13890] There are four subtle knots in it: || 60 ||
[13891] The navel,
[13892] Memory,
[13893] Flavors,
[13894] And the tip.
[13895] The first generates the root of production—within the channel resides the father's white causal bindu, the size of a mustard seed divided into ten parts.
[13896] Relying on that, the body develops upward, hence "growth."
[13897] Memory:
[13898] The mother's red conditional bindu,
[13899] Residing the size of a tenth of a mustard seed,
[13900] Serves as the support for memory's manifold activity, hence "memory." || 70 ||
[13901] In the flavors resides the wind bindu, the size of a tenth of a mustard seed,
[13902] Which separates pure from impure,
[13903] Expelling impurities such as precious bile outward,
[13904] The pure generates the body's radiance and splendor, hence "flavors."
[13905] At the tip:
[13906] Resides the light bindu, the nature of mind, the size of a tenth of a mustard seed, hence "tip."
[13907] These are called the supports of the relative.
[13908] When these move, body and mind separate.
[13909] From that relative cause ripens into blood,
[13910] From blood comes flesh, || 80 ||
[13911] From flesh comes lymph,
[13912] From lymph comes serum,
[13913] From serum comes fat,
[13914] From fat comes bone,
[13915] From bone comes bone marrow,
[13916] From bone marrow comes regenerative fluid,
[13917] From regenerative fluid ripens the relative bindu.
[13918] Similarly, the four knots of Kyangma generate:
[13919] Two flickering water-lamp seeds, like rabbit eyes, reside there.
[13920] At memory: || 90 ||
[13921] Resides the blazing fire bindu, support of self-arisen wisdom lamp.
[13922] At flavors:
[13923] Resides the five-colored light bindu, size of a mustard seed with aura, support of pure space.
[13924] At the tip:
[13925] Resides the light bindu, the support of the bindu of emptiness, each with their own colors.
[13926] Relying on that, ultimate undefiled wisdom directly dawns.
[13927] Relying on that, one naturally becomes a Buddha.
[13928] Therefore, it is called the natural bindu.
[13929] When the gates are pure, they become the four lamps.
[13930] When impure, they become the four elements. || 100 ||
[13931] The central Kundarma:
[13932] Is the gathering of the nature of all channels.
[13933] Moved by wind's attraction and expulsion, it quivers.
[13934] Being the ground of samsara and nirvana, it is called "ma."
[13935] From there moves the ultimate bindu of dharmata.
[13936] Its four knots:
[13937] At generation:
[13938] Resides the support of all bodies, the body the size of a mustard seed with clear light face and arms.
[13939] At memory:
[13940] The support of wisdom, the celestial palace with four gates, || 110 ||
[13941] Four archways,
[13942] And each deity's body color and hand implements, clear on a mustard seed,
[13943] Each one's mandala perfected according to one's affinity.
[13944] Through its essential point, the attainment of the flower-struck mandala is close.
[13945] At the tip:
[13946] Resides the support of all lights, the wrathful mandala.
[13947] Moreover, from the central channel without blood or serum, the empty wind activity,
[13948] From the right circulate water, blood, and bodhicitta, the activity of bindu,
[13949] From the left circulate element essences and wisdom, the channel's own activity.
[13950] The second: Detailed explanation of classifications has two parts: || 120 ||
[13951] General exposition of the nature of the three principal channels,
[13952] And particular explanation of the four wheels.
[13953] The first:
[13954] <prose><tantra>From the Definitive Meaning:
[13955] <prose><tantra>The body's essential point is the channel,
[13956] <prose><tantra>Location, arrangement, and movement,
[13957] <prose><tantra>Support of wheels and body life-force,
[13958] <prose><tantra>Name, particularity, cause and condition,
[13959] <prose><tantra>Active function and characteristic,
[13960] <prose><tantra>Afflictive activity and wisdom activity, || 130 ||
[13961] <prose><tantra>Depending on activity, they manifest,
[13962] <prose><tantra>Illness and element particularities,
[13963] <prose><tantra>Resting as agitation, distinguished by extent,
[13964] <prose><tantra>Cutting stops, pressing binds,
[13965] <prose><tantra>Pressing vital point, pulling clarifies,
[13966] <prose><tantra>Pulling crosses, drawing knows,
[13967] <prose><tantra>Pushing emptiness, fierce seizes,
[13968] <prose><tantra>Thus also through the channel's essential point,
[13969] <prose><tantra>The Buddha's abode is indicated.
[13970] <prose><tantra>Thus it was taught. || 140 ||
[13971] Explaining its meaning has eight parts:
[13972] Channel names,
[13973] Purifiers,
[13974] Indicators,
[13975] Generation methods,
[13976] Activities performed,
[13977] Essence,
[13978] Dharmata,
[13979] And oral instructions on how to train.
[13980] The first: || 150 ||
[13981] Generally, if one body is not established, nothing is established.
[13982] Once established, channels are established.
[13983] From channels, winds and wisdoms are established.
[13984] Through their essential point, liberation occurs,
[13985] Hence recognizing channels.
[13986] Generally, 72,000 channels reside in the body.
[13987] Particularly at generation: sixty-four.
[13988] At memory: sixteen, making eighty.
[13989] At flavors:
[13990] Thirty-two, making one hundred twelve. || 160 ||
[13991] At the tip:
[13992] Three hundred sixty,
[13993] Making 472 when the four wheels are combined—the particular summary.
[13994] The three channels emerge straight like life-trees from the centers of the four wheels without crookedness,
[13995] Outwardly serving as the support of body, speech, and mind,
[13996] Inwardly connecting through the three vajras of body, speech, and mind,
[13997] Secretly serving as the ground for the arising of the three kayas.
[13998] The three channels are:
[13999] Roma,
[14000] Kyangma, || 170 ||
[14001] And Kundarma.
[14002] Within these three reside OM, AH, and HUM,
[14003] When pure, serving as the ground for ripening into the three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[14004] When impure, serving as the ground for ripening into body, speech, and mind.
[14005] When impure, serving as the ground for ripening into body, speech, and mind.
[14006] Through perversion, opening the door for the arising of the three poisons.
[14007] Moreover, "Roma" means:
[14008] Through cutting, it tastes the supreme food-like flavor,
[14009] When left in its nature, like a corpse's flavor, unable to function.
[14010] This resides in the male's right, the female's left. || 180 ||
[14011] Some tantras show the reverse—this is merely a different intention.
[14012] Kyangma:
[14013] Through pulling, dharmas free of thought-experience arise, hence Kyangma,
[14014] When left in its nature, unrelated to others, remaining hollow.
[14015] This resides in the male's left, the female's right.
[14016] Kundarma:
[14017] Resides in the center of both male and female,
[14018] Through pressing, the experience of clear wisdom arises,
[14019] When left in its nature, performing the activity of sustaining body, speech, and mind.
[14020] Since these three channels are the mother-ground of all channels, they are called "ma." || 190 ||
[14021] Roma entering the male's right:
[14022] Generates bodhicitta.
[14023] Arising in the female's left:
[14024] Bodhicitta gathers, without satisfaction in desire.
[14025] Kyangma entering the male's left:
[14026] Holds the power of blood's attractive force,
[14027] Through the activity of dripping blood from the nose, determining the time of wisdom.
[14028] Entering the female's right:
[14029] From that, branching into the five-family channels, manifesting as indications of illnesses and race differences not found in males.
[14030] Moreover, of bluish color, short stature, beautiful teeth, round face, deer-type—the principal deer-channel, || 200 ||
[14031] For example, like the deer's anaya muscle, thick at the root, greatly desirous,
[14032] Fine at the tip, unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14033] Here, the essential point of making the bindu's vital point into the path is chief—the oral instruction of moving channels.
[14034] Also, pale complexion, straight yellow hair, thin body, prominent navel,
[14035] Round eyes, thin limbs is the elephant-trunk type.
[14036] Like the elephant's trunk channel, the channel-nose looks upward from the navel,
[14037] Unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14038] Lesser desire:
[14039] Arises from burst channels.
[14040] Here, the oral instruction of straightening channels is chief. || 210 ||
[14041] Also, black color, coarse limbs, rough face, unpleasant appearance:
[14042] Lotus-possessor,
[14043] Having a channel like an open lotus,
[14044] Round channel-mouth, unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14045] Being long, great bliss.
[14046] Here, opening the channel-mouth is chief.
[14047] Also, blue-green color,
[14048] Sharp teeth,
[14049] Long eyes and face,
[14050] Yellow hair, some thin, || 220 ||
[14051] Thin limbs, prominent navel, slow gait is the line-marked type.
[14052] Like a drawn-line channel, located in the place of joy, initially great bliss of flavor.
[14053] Abundant channel-branches, unable to actually produce bodhicitta.
[14054] Many channel-branches, whatever is touched generates production.
[14055] Here, the oral instruction of gathering channels is chief.
[14056] Also, yellow color,
[14057] Short stature,
[14058] Thin teeth,
[14059] Clear brow-space,
[14060] Short limbs, || 230 ||
[14061] Wide fingers is conch-possessor.
[14062] Like a conch coiling to the right,
[14063] Unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14064] Coiled channel, not finding the flavor of desire.
[14065] Here, the oral instruction of splitting channels is chief.
[14066] Thus, the five-family channels coming to females arise from the five poisons being particularly coarse,
[14067] From that, thirty-two different movements and deceptions arise,
[14068] Existing are thirty-two different types of illness—arising from race channels.
[14069] Moreover, from 101 wisdom-race channels,
[14070] The five races also exist within the fetus-consuming worm's own illness in females, || 240 ||
[14071] Arising from the five-race ayatanas.
[14072] Besides that, ten different illness types exist in the menses,
[14073] Five illnesses of engagement,
[14074] Five illnesses of the vessel's holding,
[14075] Seven illnesses of the abiding seed,
[14076] Making thirty-two particularly existing in females, not found in males.
[14077] Moreover, contextually, females surpass males in the vessel womb,
[14078] Non-flowing of seeds,
[14079] And activities of many worms, etc.
[14080] Generally, many illnesses enter from the vessel womb, || 250 ||
[14081] Not existing in males, hence fewer are taught.
[14082] Race channels,
[14083] Vessel,
[14084] And entry—arising from the child's body's generation.
[14085] Kundarma residing unchanging in the center of both:
[14086] Indicates Dzogchen, the unfabricated actual ground, for all.
[14087] The second: the purifiers of the three special channels:
[14088] Proficient in Roma's essential point, all bodily activities are purified.
[14089] Kyangma purifies speech,
[14090] Kundarma purifies mental activities. || 260 ||
[14091] The third: what these channels indicate:
[14092] Roma indicates bliss as thought-free; through dependent origination's wheel, memory exhausts, becoming like the aspect of taste, hence "Roma."
[14093] Kyangma:
[14094] Indicates clarity as non-dual with flavor, abiding in the meaning of singular bindu, hence "Kyangma."
[14095] Kundarma indicates union without difference, means-bliss and wisdom-emptiness united,
[14096] Relative object-possessor and ultimate non-object-possessor both united,
[14097] Called the view of pure non-dual beyond extremes without difference.
[14098] Moreover, the right indicates means, the left indicates wisdom.
[14099] The center indicates non-dual.
[14100] The fourth: how these channels generate: || 270 ||
[14101] Roma generates the body—initially body-forming from the four elements' activity,
[14102] Arising from father's cause and water, ripening in co-emergent karmic mechanism, taking the body's ground,
[14103] From mother's condition, fire and wind's ripening mechanism, separating the body's pure and impure,
[14104] Generating body—the support of bindu drops of regenerative fluid and blood, each the size of a mustard seed, reside at the four wheels' navel.
[14105] Thus, the four wheels reside as eight causes and conditions,
[14106] Gathering and expanding the aggregates of eight consciousnesses,
[14107] Connecting the places.
[14108] Relatively, the mind's ripening place exists at the twenty-first vertebra of the born,
[14109] At the female's thirteenth, at the lotus channel's pistil tip.
[14110] Its branches gather at the breast tips. || 280 ||
[14111] Their sixteen branches exist at the intersection.
[14112] The male's exists between the ribs.
[14113] They perform the activities of body-forming, abiding, and dissolving.
[14114] Kyangma generates:
[14115] Speech.
[14116] If without crookedness and straight, speech is pleasant, signs clear.
[14117] If subtle branches exist, voice cracks, short,
[14118] Or unclear signs, stuttering comes.
[14119] Naturally without branches or crookedness.
[14120] When these channels go to the ten, voice goes gag-gag, abandoning comes. || 290 ||
[14121] If that channel has upper-lower thick-thin narrowness, voice has many peaks,
[14122] Obstructions come.
[14123] If that channel has lapping, voice comes trembling and quivering.
[14124] If channel is empty, voice comes loud, devouring others.
[14125] Yogis, through channel oral instructions, can transform these,
[14126] Split,
[14127] And press to correct.
[14128] If Roma's channels contract, body comes to the ten, etc., as before.
[14129] Residing straight, body's characteristics complete, possessing form and youth,
[14130] Is good channels bringing body's good qualities. || 300 ||
[14131] Kundarma generates mind—if many crookednesses in that channel, always distracted, not reaching one-pointedness.
[14132] If branches exist in it, sharp mind, forgetfulness.
[14133] If thick-thin exists, much mental fluctuation, not abiding one-pointedly.
[14134] Beginning many activities, no stability.
[14135] If that channel is empty, whatever is thought becomes virtue, possessing wisdom, bright mind.
[14136] If that channel has no thick-thin and is straight, stable mind without fluctuation.
[14137] If on the right, much thought.
[14138] If on the left, always dwelling in doubt and hesitation.
[14139] If that tip moves, always much suffering, unhappy mind.
[14140] If that channel smooths, always peaceful mind, diligent in virtue. || 310 ||
[14141] If that channel-mouth large, always great diligence, completing endeavors.
[14142] Moreover, body generates channels,
[14143] Channels generate speech,
[14144] Speech generates mind,
[14145] Mind generates dharmata,
[14146] Dharmata generates yoga, hence "generation."
[14147] The fifth: what activities these channels perform:
[14148] Roma shows the pure essence's lamp-radiance,
[14149] Impure performs the activity of dripping bile.
[14150] Kyangma, attracting pure upward, shows the lamp's self-appearance, || 320 ||
[14151] Causing experience and increase.
[14152] Its impure, moving downward, discards as precious bile.
[14153] Kundarma, attracting pure upward,
[14154] Actually shows ultimate bodhicitta,
[14155] Impure dripping downward,
[14156] Causes relative bodhicitta bindu to flow.
[14157] Moreover, males actually release it,
[14158] Meeting bliss called "contact-destruction"—
[14159] Experiencing, before bindu falls, destroying bliss.
[14160] Females, the five families gathering and abiding, called "increasing contact," bliss expands, unsatisfied. || 330 ||
[14161] Females' menses flowing:
[14162] Arises from the nose-channel's movement,
[14163] Actual blood flowing.
[14164] Moreover, through the element's essential point, untimely menses flow indicates illness-agitation.
[14165] Flowing twice or thrice in one month indicates womb-change.
[14166] Always flowing in the month's upper half indicates male increase.
[14167] Always flowing in the lower half indicates female increase.
[14168] Interrupted, making large and small, children don't come.
[14169] Yellow blood flow and color indicates few children.
[14170] Black color becoming precious bile, many sons and daughters increase; if odorless and unnoticed flowing, male-female twins come. || 340 ||
[14171] The sixth: the essence of these channels:
[14172] Roma's essence is bliss—possessing special means, liberating into the nature of dharmata, the pure object of apprehension.
[14173] Kyangma's essence:
[14174] Is emptiness—
[14175] Through pure wisdom, liberating apprehending mind's thought into dharmata.
[14176] Kundarma's essence is bliss-emptiness non-dual, union without two, revealing free wisdom liberated from apprehension and apprehender.
[14177] The seventh: the dharmata of these channels:
[14178] Roma's dharmata is taking food and separating food's pure and impure.
[14179] If its passage wide, that person's belly large.
[14180] If narrow, belly small. || 350 ||
[14181] If crooked, always vomiting, not taking food.
[14182] Many sudden various illnesses.
[14183] Kyangma:
[14184] Performs the activity of bodily heat's fluctuation.
[14185] If this channel narrow, body naturally has great heat.
[14186] If wide, small, always cold.
[14187] Crookedness, movement, etc., as before.
[14188] Kundarma:
[14189] Shows the dharmata of thirst's varieties and non-thirst.
[14190] If this narrow, never thirsty. || 360 ||
[14191] If wide, great thirst.
[14192] If crooked, shows various uncertain activities.
[14193] If immediately tangled, various illnesses of body, speech, and mind without autonomy arise.
[14194] Moreover, proficient in Roma's essential point, cutting food attachment, becomes samadhi-food.
[14195] Kyangma, cutting clothing attachment, becomes endowed with heat.
[14196] Central channel, cutting thirst attachment, dream-continuum ceases,
[14197] Acting in clear light's meaning.
[14198] These three's essential points are great.
[14199] The eighth: oral instructions on how to train these channels:
[14200] Body and Roma joined, body-forming is sambhogakaya. || 370 ||
[14201] Abiding is nirmanakaya.
[14202] Dissolving, liberating into dharmakaya, body's three-kaya mandala.
[14203] Kyangma with speech's abiding is samadhi.
[14204] Speech's expression is meditation.
[14205] Speech's exhaustion shows these dharmatas,
[14206] Sound syllables of secret mantra's self-sound.
[14207] Kundarma with mind's movement, memory-thought pure dharmata joined, thoughts before and after self-cease, self-liberated self-arisen wisdom joined, objects and conditions liberate into dharmata,
[14208] Memory-thought self-exhausted, dharmata's intention dawns.
[14209] Thus:
[14210] <prose><tantra>Body is the three-kaya mandala body, || 380 ||
[14211] <prose><tantra>Whatever is spoken is mantra speech,
[14212] <prose><tantra>However contemplated is meditation itself,
[14213] <prose><tantra>As taught in the Pearl Garland Tantra.
[14214] Moreover, stirring the channel's ripening place, the channel's own characteristic is determined.
[14215] Seeking the place, dharmata arising from channels is recognized.
[14216] Knowing the channel's leap time, death-transference and birthplace are recognized.
[14217] Channel's nature immersed, mind's samadhi wheel is not separated.
[14218] Grasping the warmed channel's heat measure, always becomes food yoga.
[14219] Following channel movement calculation, becomes clothing yoga.
[14220] Following the channel pushing essential point, for cutting latency continuum, the channel's essential point is extremely profound. || 390 ||
[14221] The second: the classification of the four wheels has two parts:
[14222] The establishment of the four wheels,
[14223] And explanation of their individual classifications.
[14224] The first:
[14225] Though the body of a single being is established depending on many dharmas depending on wheels,
[14226] And not depending on wheels,
[14227] Like external existence's attachment-habit depending on wind, then water,
[14228] Then depending on water, earth, etc.,
[14229] Wind-mind gathering in pure essence, water unifying into one, internal body forming,
[14230] The first wheel is established from water's activity, || 400 ||
[14231] Arising in the ripening place of blood, serum, saliva, tears, etc.
[14232] The body's increase and decrease is performed by blood.
[14233] When elements heat, blood dries, becoming body illness.
[14234] Increasing blood eliminates illness.
[14235] When cold, blood freezes, becoming illness.
[14236] Warming eliminates illness.
[14237] Thus, earth depending on such water,
[14238] The second wheel is chief in earth's activity.
[14239] Earth: body's muscle meat,
[14240] Organ meat, || 410 ||
[14241] And meat-varieties spreading from the heart, depending.
[14242] These, cutting,
[14243] Patching,
[14244] Pounding,
[14245] And piercing cause life-time,
[14246] Moxibustion, through dependent origination, liberates from illness.
[14247] Thus, earth generating wood, etc., becomes fire's cause at the egg's empower-place,
[14248] The third wheel is chief in fire's activity.
[14249] When heat great, becomes the fire element,
[14250] Causing body illness and death condition, || 420 ||
[14251] When heat small, becomes cold illness condition, causing illness and death condition, balanced elements' dharmata dependent origination performs liberation.
[14252] Moreover, like fire generating heat, wind agitating, greatly blazing,
[14253] The fourth wheel performs wind's activity,
[14254] Breath moving outer and inner,
[14255] Performing ascending and descending activity,
[14256] Karma wind performs samsara's root,
[14257] Latency and hostility activity agitating body elements' individual activities, causing illness and death condition—
[14258] Through dependent origination of placing elements at the vital point, liberation.
[14259] Moreover, depending on water, flesh forms, body's flesh increases.
[14260] Depending on space-emptiness nature, water forms, blood increases. || 430 ||
[14261] Depending on earth, ripening into fire, body's heat and pure increase.
[14262] Depending on fire, forming into wind, breath, radiance, splendor, and strength increase.
[14263] Moreover, generation transforms into male and female.
[14264] Memory transforms long and short life.
[14265] Flavors transform great and small enjoyment.
[14266] Tip transforms pure and impure sense powers and migrators' friendliness-hostility.
[14267] Generation's attraction manifests large body, coarse limbs, great strength.
[14268] Its gathering makes small form, weak strength.
[14269] From gathering, large form but weak strength, thin limbs.
[14270] From gathering-leap, small form but possessing strength. || 440 ||
[14271] Memory's attraction makes bright mind, clear senses, no coarse thought.
[14272] From gathering, great thought and forgetfulness.
[14273] From gathering, clear senses, bright mind, forgetful.
[14274] Attraction-leap makes great thought but quick samadhi generation.
[14275] Flavors' pure attraction makes pleasant speech, clear words, skilled sound.
[14276] Gathering makes unpleasant speech.
[14277] Increase-impure makes pleasant speech, great eloquence, but speech without power.
[14278] Tip's pure attraction makes pure mind, accomplishing thought.
[14279] Increase-impure makes mind's good accomplished, but virtue not increasing.
[14280] Gathering makes mind's desire unaccomplished, wrong memory-thought. || 450 ||
[14281] Pure gathering makes mind's desire unaccomplished, but virtue increases.
[14282] This is the certainty of attraction and gathering.
[14283] Moreover, the reason for four wheels' certainty:
[14284] One and two don't ripen empowerment, path, and final result fruit; three also doesn't ripen, reverse certainty also makes four certain.
[14285] Through connection sequence of what is to be connected and connector, agreement certainty also makes four certain:
[14286] Outer four elements,
[14287] Inner four wisdoms,
[14288] Secret four lamps,
[14289] Supreme four kayas' certainty also makes four wheels certain.
[14290] Also, body, speech, mind, and consciousness four, || 460 ||
[14291] Four purifiers,
[14292] Four result fruits' certainty also makes their ground the four wheels.
[14293] The second: explanation of individual classifications of the four wheels has four parts:
[14294] Navel nirmanakaya wheel,
[14295] Heart dharmacakra wheel,
[14296] Throat sambhogakaya wheel,
[14297] Crown great bliss wheel.
[14298] The first has four:
[14299] General classification exposition,
[14300] Individual limb explanation, || 470 ||
[14301] Particular essential point exposition,
[14302] Definite correction method explanation.
[14303] The first:
[14304] Root channel, six petals, from four water-channels branching, countless petals,
[14305] Particularly, inner channel certainty:
[14306] <prose><tantra>Element,
[14307] <prose><tantra>Mind,
[14308] <prose><tantra>Ignorance,
[14309] <prose><tantra>Mind,
[14310] <prose><tantra>Lethargy-gathering classification, || 480 ||
[14311] <prose><tantra>From small wheel petals, thirty-eight, eightfold transformation,
[14312] <prose><tantra>Divided, 2,432 exist.
[14313] <prose><tantra>Moreover, root and limb classification:
[14314] <prose><tantra>Channels residing in wheels,
[14315] <prose><tantra>Nirmana wheel sixty-four petals,
[14316] <prose><tantra>Element, etc., sequence division:
[14317] <prose><tantra>Earth channels in five aspects
[14318] <prose><tantra>Perform body's ground holding.
[14319] <prose><tantra>Water channels in five aspects
[14320] <prose><tantra>Gather body's pure essence. || 490 ||
[14321] <prose><tantra>Fire's pure essence gathering.
[14322] <prose><tantra>Wind channels in five aspects
[14323] <prose><tantra>Gather wind's pure essence.
[14324] <prose><tantra>Mind channels in five aspects
[14325] <prose><tantra>Gather breath's pure essence.
[14326] <prose><tantra>Ignorance channels in five aspects
[14327] <prose><tantra>Show individual body fluid connections.
[14328] <prose><tantra>Space mind channels in two
[14329] <prose><tantra>Gather breath and consciousness pure essence.
[14330] <prose><tantra>Lethargy-gathering channels six || 500 ||
[14331] <prose><tantra>Gather objects and ignorance.
[14332] <prose><tantra>These channel aspects
[14333] <prose><tantra>Fifteen go upward,
[14334] <prose><tantra>Fifteen go downward,
[14335] <prose><tantra>Eight certainly transform horizontally.
[14336] <prose><tantra>Thus it is.
[14337] The second: explanation of outer channel limbs:
[14338] <prose><tantra>From that:
[14339] <prose><tantra>From this nirmana wheel,
[14340] <prose><tantra>Aspects transforming outward, || 510 ||
[14341] <prose><tantra>These channel aspects
[14342] <prose><tantra>From its right-left petals,
[14343] <prose><tantra>Great garland-like channels
[14344] <prose><tantra>Transform with color-possessing aspects.
[14345] <prose><tantra>Behind the knee depressions,
[14346] <prose><tantra>Black light-possessing, one each.
[14347] <prose><tantra>To these two, ten each.
[14348] <prose><tantra>From their petals,
[14349] <prose><tantra>Gold-color like channels,
[14350] <prose><tantra>At calf center, one each. || 520 ||
[14351] <prose><tantra>To these two, five each.
[14352] <prose><tantra>Then to wheel petals,
[14353] <prose><tantra>Great transforming channels,
[14354] <prose><tantra>Two mist-like channels
[14355] <prose><tantra>Certainly transform in elephant marrow.</tanqua>
[14356] <prose><tantra>To these two also, five each.
[14357] <prose><tantra>To bliss wheel's mud,
[14358] <prose><tantra>Extremely subtle great channels
[14359] <prose><tantra>At ankle-joint, two each.
[14360] <prose><tantra>To these two, four each. || 530 ||
[14361] <prose><tantra>Thus it is.
[14362] Thus, outer channel, inner, karma and wisdom movement, etc.:
[14363] <prose><tantra>From that:
[14364] <prose><tantra>These channel aspects
[14365] <prose><tantra>Reside in wheel body.
[14366] <prose><tantra>To nirmana nature wheel,

[14369] <prose><tantra>These channel aspects
[14370] <prose><tantra>Gathering channels ten reside, || 540 ||
[14371] <prose><tantra>Performing agitation and holding activities.
[14372] <prose><tantra>Among these,
[14373] <prose><tantra>Gathering pure essence one each,
[14374] <prose><tantra>Sometimes agitating elements,
[14375] <prose><tantra>Sometimes latency,
[14376] <prose><tantra>Sometimes resting in their place.
[14377] <prose><tantra>Wisdom channels in eight aspects
[14378] <prose><tantra>Merely reside holding consciousness portion.
[14379] <prose><tantra>Remainder karma and affliction channels,
[14380] <prose><tantra>Fifty reside, || 550 ||
[14381] <prose><tantra>Karma channels are ten.
[14382] <prose><tantra>Remainder becomes affliction channels.
[14383] <prose><tantra>From forty affliction channels,
[14384] <prose><tantra>Ignorance channels are ten.
[14385] <prose><tantra>Mind channels also that many.

[14410] <prose><tantra>Two are bile serum channels. || 580 ||
[14411] <prose><tantra>Remainder are gathering channels.
[14412] <prose><tantra>Wisdom itself is self-clarity.
[14413] <prose><tantra>That is navel channel.
[14414] <prose><tantra>Thus it is.
[14415] The third: particular essential point exposition:
[14416] <prose><tantra>From Lumpy Segments Essential Point:
[14417] <prose><tantra>From elaboration channels among these,
[14418] <prose><tantra>Sixty-eight nirmana channels,
[14419] <prose><tantra>From these channel aspects
[14420] <prose><tantra>Five suitable-for-cutting channels exist. || 590 ||
[14421] <prose><tantra>Uncut, five defects occur.
[14422] <prose><tantra>Cut, these become defects.
[14423] <prose><tantra>Twelve leaping channels exist.
[14424] <prose><tantra>Seven death channels if bled.

[14433] Moreover, explained as sixty-eight:
[14434] Root Roma-Kyangma-Kundarma three, light channels four, gold great channels combined.
[14435] Naturally sixty-four.
[14436] Some count the root three, saying so,
[14437] Combined with the four light channels, thus they assert.
[14438] The fourth: definite illness correction methods:
[14439] <prose><tantra>From Lumpy Segments Essential Text,
