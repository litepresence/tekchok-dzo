[16025] The karmic winds, pure and stainless, release themselves from the domain of the wisdom-wind, far-snared and liberated at a distance.


### PAGE 384

<list>
[16027] Through the wisdom-wind, the elements are cast far into the distance.
[16028] The four virtues and so forth arise from this.
[16029] From the subtle and detailed aspect of the wind, appearances emerge.
[16030] Even the smallest supports, such as mountains and houses, appear vast and great.
[16031] This is the actual casting-far.
[16032] The pure light-root holds the appearances of wisdom.
[16033] Through seeing the delusive appearances of that support, one understands the supporter and the supported.
[16034] Through examining these two aspects by means of wisdom, realization should occur.
[16035] These are also the Four Lamps.
[16036] The delusive appearances of samsara and the deluded mind are different.
[16037] This is the great essential point of holding the aspect that transcends.
[16038] If one knows the difference between these two, my essential point can be understood.
</list>

[16039] This is the lamp of the empty bindu.
[16040] The bindu, round and surrounded by the rim of the five lights, arises from the pure aspect of the karma-wind.
[16041] From that arises the lamp of self-arisen wisdom.
[16042] And from that arise the two lamps of completely pure space.
[16043] The essence of wisdom, the potential, and the tone arise from these three.
[16044] When applying the essential points of the casting-far gaze-posture to the lamp of the empty bindu, the inner awareness experiences pure self-clarity.
[16045] From the potential, outward-clear object-knowledge becomes sharp and quick.
[16046] The meanings of words arise as the expanse.
[16047] The tone is like a golden cord hanging in the appearance of the vajra-chain.

<list>
[16048] If these are not distinguished, confusion arises:
[16049] Sometimes the inner tone is labeled as the lamp of self-arisen wisdom.
[16050] Sometimes the chain is merely labeled, causing confusion.
</list>

[16051] The lamp of space arises from the outer and inner.
[16052] First, in the center of the pure outer sky, a blue-green light-tone appears somewhat.
[16053] From that, it expands and arises.
[16054] The radiance of the five lights is clear as the five colors.
[16055] That is also space, both outer and inner.
[16056] The outer is held in the cloud-free sky.
[16057] The inner is the pure lamp of space.
[16058] Thus it is said.
[16059] Some identify this with the outer sky merely without clouds, but this is not proper.


### PAGE 385

[16060] That sky has no established connection with the person.
[16061] The lamp follows the existence and non-existence of the person as the cause of what to do.
[16062] Here, the blue tone of the inner sky that arises outward is called the outer space.
[16063] By that, from the mere basis of the arising of the open sky, space is not actual.
[16064] The actual is dark-blue.
[16065] The inner space is the inner of the inner.
[16066] Thus, from that space, as appearances arise and appear, these two are called the outer space and the inner space separately.
[16067] Understanding the clear transfer of the rainbow-light load into the house of not-clear, just understand.
[16068] That does not make the inner near and the outer far.
[16069] From that, know the outer and inner as that which arises and appears.
[16070] The five lights are clear, and the mind's self-essence arises as the self-tone of clear light.
[16071] Through that self, the stains of things and the stains of intellectual wisdom are completely pure.
[16072] Through the bad-concept mind's stain, this is the lamp.
[16073] When seeing that appearance, from the clearing of the darkness of karma and habitual tendencies, this is said.
[16074] That gathers the essence of the Four Lamps from the four first chakras.
[16075] Through the first wind, one is propelled upward from below into the mother's womb.
[16076] From afar, it is called casting-far, and from the mother's womb far away, through the cause-conditions and entering the mother's center, it shows.
[16077] Through the cause-conditions of the mindfulness wind-mind, the four gather as one.
[16078] Through binding, it is called the snare.
[16079] Through the six tastes increasing in tastes, and through the essence-eye expanding, it is called the water.
[16080] Through directly realizing the distinction of the five senses' actions and the distinction of the five wisdoms, and through the direct arising of the reality sense's object, it is called the lamp that clears the darkness of samsara.
[16081] From the lamp of the empty bindu, if compared with the relative cause-bindu:
[16082] The bindu is essence-lower by means of posture.
[16083] The le is held secretly by means of the speech-HUM and so forth, and wisdom is identified.
[16084] The empty is the reverse of the bindu, and through bestowing potential and mixing with wind, meditation on emptiness is the action of the mind.
[16085] Through the meaning of that, darkness is cleared by means of the lamp.
[16086] If compared with the ultimate wisdom-bindu, the bindu is the gaze-posture's essence, and the three are the awareness-self's essence not-change.
[16087] The le is.


### PAGE 386

[16089] The appearance of the light's rim arises as round.
[16090] The empty is.
[16091] Through the not-established thing and characteristic, the harm of the four elements does not occur.
[16092] Through self-appearance, it shows, but through other, it is not seen.
[16093] Through clear-light, it is free from the extreme of elaboration and clears the darkness of ignorance.
[16094] This is the lamp.
[16095] The clearing of samsara's darkness.
[16096] From the lamp of self-arising knowledge, when realizing the essence and comparing:
[16097] Knowledge is called by means of the main essential point of the nadi where the wind dwells.
[16098] The excellent is called by means of the main essential point of the number of propel-withdrawal of the wind.
[16099] Through arising from reality and dwelling in reality:
[16100] The self-arising is called by means of the free occasion arising in the three excellent moments.
[16101] Through exhausting the wind and freeing in space, it is called the lamp.
[16102] If compared with clear-light appearance:
[16103] Through inner wisdom, self-tone self-aware arises as the sense-object, and through that, knowledge is called.
[16104] Through the chain of arising-appearance, bindu, bindu-particle, and together with that, the sense-field of all exhaust of delusive appearance is most-transcend excellent called.

<list>
[16105] Within this, various phenomena appear:
[16106] Letters and hand-symbols and form and so forth appear.
[16107] When the ten earth and so forth exhaust time, actually appear.
</list>

[16108] Through that which cannot appear together with delusion to sense, the exhaust of wisdom is called.
[16109] Through that appearance and the basis of that time's reasoning appearing with wisdom and together with other not arising, self arising, it is called self.
[16110] That arises and connection is established.
[16111] From awareness, self-appearance arises as the cause.
[16112] This is the lamp.
[16113] The darkness of mind and mental-events, the mind-from that word is said.
[16114] The lamp of completely pure space arises from directly seeing the essential point.
[16115] That is also the arising-basis of the five lights, and through that, it is called space.
[16116] When the appearance of light arises, through pure together with element impurity, it is called completely pure.
[16117] Through seeing that self, transforming the impure-together light body, and through clearing the darkness of samsara, it is called the lamp.
[16118] If compared with the sequence experience-apply:
[16119] First, through purifying the basis of the three body speech mind, it is called space.


### PAGE 387

<list>
[16120] If the essential point of the body is not pressed, wisdom does not gather under power.
[16121] If the essential point of speech is not pressed, the meaning of the inexpressible is not obtained.
[16122] If the essential point of mind is not pressed, the movement self-continuum is not cut.
[16123] If pressed, these are accomplished.
</list>

[16124] Through the main great path of self-seen directly, it is completely called.
[16125] Through the essential point of the door, seeing space and the pure cause of delusive appearance ceasing.
[16126] Through the essential point of the arise-produce door, seeing the reality of space and arriving at certainty.
[16127] Through the essential point of the appearance object, whatever appears, from reality, grasp-place not.
[16128] Through the vital point bestowing wind's essential point, different conceptual-thought ceases.
[16129] Through the essential point of arise-produce clear-light, subtle-coarse elements reverse.
[16130] Through the essential point of directly seeing reality, through intellectual words, the sequence of view-meditation-conduct-result of reality's meaning is cut.
[16131] Through seeing the appearance of experience progress increase, the impure material-awareness self-ceases of delusive appearance.
[16132] Through seeing the appearance of awareness measure arrive, the two form-bodies are enjoyed.
[16133] Through seeing the exhaust of reality appearance, from the bind of the three-kayas' self-continuum, one is free.
[16134] Thus, making result as path, through from-the-start effort-accomplish cause-result, from all vehicles, one transcends.
[16135] The lamp is like a wall lamp, and the branch of the essential point of experience-in take is shown as the four final support instructions.
[16136] Through having basis on the three not-change, the increase of conceptual-thought exhausts, and from the appearance of reality and self, there is no place to go.
[16137] Through holding all measures of the three dwell, the three body speech mind realms are understood to not return.
[16138] Through obtaining the three vital points hitting, the connection cord of the four cause-condition wind-mind is cut, and hereafter, those four cannot meet together.
[16139] Through grasping the measure of the four free confidences, with no hope-doubt for samsara-nirvana, one has gone to the certainty object of reality's space.
[16140] Thus, if the Four Lamps are not, the connection of samsara-nirvana is not cut.


### PAGE 388

[16141] The four body speech mind and mind always wander from samsara.
[16142] Through understanding and deciding that the Four Lamps exist, taking experience, liberation's enlightenment is obtained.
[16143] Through the Four Lamps existing:
[16144] From purifying the self-continuum through the four basis-ripening empowerments,
[16145] Through arriving at the measure of the four path appearances, the essential points of that which dissolves the four kayas into space arise.
[16146] The self-arisen lamp dwells like the sky in the precious jar of the heart, the precious meaning-heart's jar.
[16147] Through the interval joining the Four Lamps like the connection-cord sky of the middle mouth,
[16148] Like the great outer sky, the mother and son unite in the free-place of primordially-pure space.
[16149] When the measure arrives or the bardo self-clear reality arises, through the impure-together body's jar breaking,
[16150] It penetrates the spontaneously-accomplish precious secret cavity.
[16151] The reality of the Four Lamps arises from taking experience.
[16152] Here also, summarizing, if explaining the enumeration of the Four Lamps:
[16153] The Four Lamps gather to the ultimate element.
[16154] The casting-far is ripened.
[16155] Through seeing the form's aspect from afar, it is called distance.
[16156] Through arising from the self element wind, movement is not hindered.
[16157] Through holding the form from afar, it is called the snare.
[16158] Through engaging color, shape, and so forth, the water aspect of the element is called water.

[16174] That is also through gathering wisdom of abandoning not-possessing reality's extreme-limit and free worldly knowledge.
