[12779] Obtain not-thinking samadhi in dharmata intermediate state, certain to become buddha. That also from Sun-Moon Ga-Union:
[12780] If doing other's benefit,
[12781] For grasping that self by compassion,
[12782] Open door three's doors,
[12783] Breath: hold, inhale, and throw;

[12795] If mind of equal remaining arises,

[12814] Important meditation producing effort in not dying now. Sixth, showing birth-place signs: warmth dissolving to crown, certainly giving breath as excellent primordially-pure, middle intermediate state, last emanation-body. Ordinary birth-beings giving breath by birth in high realms. That also: at death-time, eye doing dust-eye, warmth gathering to genitals, birth toward animal.

[13222] Natural-state action-effort from free confidence obtain-by, door three-of action any not do, and
[13223] All basis not-exist primordial-emptiness great realize-by, any-to entity characteristics-grasp from free, nature-of state-from moment even not-separate meaning vast-expanse from arise.
[13224] Thus yogin those-to death examine and
[13225] Deceive and
[13226] Clarify not need.
[13227] View-meditation from surpass, dharma-by benefit-harm not, and
[13228] Self-appear primordial-pure and spontaneous arise-by, liberation place self-nature as appear.
[13229] Spontaneous primordial-pure expanse-into dissolve-from liberate, because.
[13230] Thus also
[13231] From Sun-Moon Face-Union,
[13232] Yogin this thus examine:
[13233] Inferior faculty inferior is,

[13247] This all elements self finish
[13248] Not-see not-take thus
[13249] Yogin self-of sphere is.
[13250] This-to habituation-of self-momentum obtain.
[13251] Die time this know-by,
[13252] Body mind transference-of characteristics know.
[13253] Thus abide yogin-to,
[13254] Die condition permanent and impermanent not,
[13255] Like-that fear all free and

[13261] Cause and effect-of ripening free.
[13262] Therefore this-to habituation supreme:
[13263] Self-arise self-liberate birth-not-exist expanse.
[13264] Time not-change appear change.
[13265] Spontaneous primordial-pure expanse-into dissolve.
[13266] Hope fear two-of extreme from free.
[13267] Cause effect two-of extreme finish-from,
[13268] Sphere awareness two-not-exist primordial-pure expanse.
[13269] Therefore this meaning realize-by sufficient.

[13295] Earth earth-to dissolve-by power lose,
[13296] Water water-to dissolve-by moist contract,
[13297] Fire fire-to dissolve-by heat small,
[13298] Wind wind-to dissolve-by breath draw difficult,
[13299] Space space-to dissolve-by consciousness clear lose-from memory not clear.
[13300] Second also outer inner two-from:
[13301] Outer elements four is,
[13302] Inner elements first outer elements-to dissolve, and
[13303] Very clear secret elements-to dissolve-from.
