[8810] Behold—the spontaneous sound of awareness, self-arisen, self-liberated.
[8811] Not fabricated, not sought: this very sound resounds without a source.
[8812] Elaborate? It is the play of unborn emptiness.
[8813] Unelaborate? The same play, naturally free.
[8814] Very unelaborate? Awareness recognizing itself in every echo.
[8815] Utterly unelaborate? Neither sound nor silence—pure recognition, naked and immediate.
[8816] Do you hear it? This is not hearing with ears.
[8817] The person capable of recognition enters thus: appearances not cut, naturally pure.
[8818] Consciousness not ceased—self-liberated upon arising.
[8819] Outer: wind-mind, father-mother—all are the spontaneous display of awareness.
[8820] Inner: body-wheel, channel-difference—your own nature, naturally perfect. || 10 ||
[8821] Secret: lamp four appearances—self-showing, self-recognized.
[8822] Unsurpassed: no face to show, no path to clear—recognition itself is the four certainties.
[8823] <list> Second, showing the spontaneous ripening:
[8824] When recognition dawns, ripening-appearance: pure and impure, sky and space—all included in awareness.
[8825] Desire-destruction dwell in three times—all included in this instant of recognition.
[8826] Body, speech, mind—this very recognition liberates.
[8827] Saṃsāra-Nirvāṇa—conditioned and unconditioned become one in recognition.
[8828] Appearance-control: aggregates, elements, sense-sources—spontaneously pure, never stained.
[8829] Existence-control: afflictions—self-liberated in their own ground. || 20 ||
[8830] Recognition enters through body, speech, mind, consciousness—action spontaneously shows.
[8831] Elaborate recognition: obtain, dwell, stabilize, near-realize—four aspects of one taste.
[8832] Very unelaborate: body, speech, mind, consciousness—fourfold bliss of natural awareness.
[8833] Utterly unelaborate: three doors, deity body-speech-mind—beyond expression, beyond dwelling.
[8834] <list> Third, the nature of recognition—fourfold spontaneous perfection:
[8835] The field is good: awareness itself, stainless and vast.
[8836] The seed faultless: recognition, never separate from you.
[8837] Elaborate recognition planted, unelaborate sprout arises.
[8838] Very unelaborate: the flower of awareness shines.
[8839] Utterly unelaborate: four kayas certain—this is the ripened result. || 30 ||
[8840] <list> From each recognition—four divisions spontaneously perfect.
