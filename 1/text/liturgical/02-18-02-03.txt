[4406] Where no awareness-continuum exists as such, Meaning's Tantra is imputed—thus established.
[4407] The Essence-Nature Tantra is awareness itself.
[4408] Directly seeing awareness's dharmatā, the continuum of those passed beyond holds the Tantra.
[4409] Without the Guru's oral instruction, unseen—yet transmitted through saṃsāra, thus it is Tantra.
[4410] The Flower-Nature Tantra:
[4411] The Four Lamps—whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is Rigpa—thus the Flower-Tantra.
[4412] Not seeing that, transmitted through the class of karma and kleśas—thus also Tantra.
[4413] The Quintessence-Nature Tantra:
[4414] That essence, practiced, condenses into quintessence—thus called.
[4415] Seeing wisdom's appearance: since indestructible throughout the Three Realms, it is Tantra.
[4416] That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is explained elsewhere among the seventeen definitive tantras of Great Secret.
[4417] <tantra>From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras</tantra>:
[4418] All Buddhas' essence gathered,
[4419] Placed within the hearts of all beings.
[4420] That essence: the intestine-continuum.
[4421] Since clarity is gathered, called "quintessence."
[4422] Thus,
[4423] <tantra>From the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra</tantra>:
[4424] All teachings' supreme essence: dharmatā's direct path.
