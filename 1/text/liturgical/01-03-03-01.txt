[1751] Fifth: The afflictions as un-recognized wisdom—
[1752] These are not defilements to be abandoned but wisdom temporarily obscured.
[1753] When rigpa fails to recognize its own nature, it appears as ignorance.
[1754] Yet ignorance itself has the nature of primordial knowing.
[1755] The six root afflictions are wisdom's dynamic energy when unrecognized:
[1756] Attachment is the portion of discernment fixating on its own display.
[1757] Hatred is the clarity of wisdom reacting to its un-recognized state.
[1758] Delusion is wisdom's natural luminosity temporarily veiled by confusion.
[1759] Pride is the sovereignty of awareness grasping at a self where none exists.
[1760] Jealousy is the unobstructed play of wisdom comparing its own aspects.
[1761] Doubt is the natural questioning of the inconceivable before recognition dawns. || 10 ||
[1762] The twenty secondary afflictions are variations of this same pattern—
[1763] Aggression, resentment, concealment, spite, jealousy, avarice, deceit, hypocrisy,
[1764] Pridefulness, harmfulness, non-shame, non-embarrassment, lethargy, excitement,
[1765] Lack of faith, laziness, non-introspection, distraction, and forgetfulness.
[1766] All arise when the five wisdoms fail to recognize themselves.
[1767] When mirror-like wisdom does not recognize itself, it appears as delusion.
[1768] When wisdom of equality does not recognize itself, it appears as pride and jealousy.
[1769] When discriminating wisdom does not recognize itself, it appears as attachment.
[1770] When all-accomplishing wisdom does not recognize itself, it appears as aggression. || 20 ||
[1771] When dharmadhatu wisdom does not recognize itself, it appears as fundamental ignorance.
[1772] Yet these afflictions have never strayed from their nature—
[1773] Like clouds never straying from the sky's expanse.
[1774] They are temporary adventitious stains, not inherent to mind's nature.
[1775] As the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra proclaims:
[1776] "The six afflictions are wisdom's unrecognized display—
[1777] Ignorance is dharmadhatu wisdom temporarily veiled.
[1778] Delusion is mirror-like wisdom clouded by confusion.
[1779] Hatred is the clarity aspect reacting to misperception.
[1780] Pride is wisdom of equality grasping at distinction. || 30 ||
[1781] Attachment is discriminating wisdom fixating on its own discernment.
[1782] Jealousy is all-accomplishing wisdom comparing what is non-dual."
[1783] Thus it is taught—the afflictions are wisdom in disguise.
[1784] Regarding the aggregates as kayas' display:
[1785] The form aggregate, when unrecognized, is grasped as solid and real.
[1786] When recognized, it is the unceasing display of nirmanakaya's benefit.
[1787] The feeling aggregate, when unrecognized, cycles through pleasure and pain.
[1788] When recognized, it is sambhogakaya's bliss-emptiness enjoyment.
[1789] The perception aggregate, when unrecognized, distinguishes self from other.
[1790] When recognized, it is the natural discernment of wisdom-mind. || 40 ||
[1791] The formations aggregate, when unrecognized, accumulates karmic latencies.
[1792] When recognized, it is the spontaneous activity of compassionate energy.
[1793] The consciousness aggregate, when unrecognized, grasps at subject and object.
[1794] When recognized, it is dharmakaya's self-arising primordial knowing.
[1795] Thus the five aggregates are the mandala of the five kayas—
[1796] Not transformed but recognized as they are.
[1797] The purification is not a removal but a seeing.
[1798] As the Pearl-Garland Tantra reveals:
[1799] "Like seeing a snake where there is only a rope—
[1800] Grasping what does not exist as if real. || 50 ||
[1801] Outer and inner, vessels and contents, appear as two distinct realms.
[1802] When examined with wisdom, this is merely the rope—the empty nature.
[1803] Vessels and contents are primordially empty of inherent existence.
[1804] They have the form of ultimate and conventional truths.
[1805] Seeing the snake is conventionally true as deluded perception.
[1806] Seeing the rope is ultimately true as wisdom perception.
[1807] Like a bird dwelling on high, seeing the entire landscape."
[1808] Thus aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and afflictions.
[1809] Actions and afflictions are not ultimately real—
[1810] Yet mental activities constantly abide as their display. || 60 ||
[1811] The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind.
[1812] The phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere at all.
[1813] White actions, black actions, mixed actions—all are wisdom-display.
[1814] Virtue is wisdom recognizing its own nature.
[1815] Non-virtue is wisdom failing to recognize itself.
[1816] The ten virtues are the natural expression of recognition.
[1817] The ten non-virtues are confusion temporarily dominant.
[1818] Yet even confusion has never left the nature of mind.
[1819] As the Uttara Tantra teaches:
[1820] "Earth abides in water and wind. || 70 ||
[1821] Wind abides excellently in space.
[1822] Space is not contained in wind, water, nor earth element.
[1823] Thus aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleśas.
[1824] Actions and kleśas are not ultimately real,
[1825] Yet mental activities constantly abide as their display.
[1826] The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind.
[1827] The phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere at all."
[1828] Thus it is taught—all afflictions are wisdom unrecognized.
[1829] When recognition dawns, they are self-liberated in their own place.
[1830] Not rejected, not accepted—simply seen as they are. || 80 ||
[1831] The eighty-four thousand conceptual masses are the play of dharmakaya.
[1832] The root poisons—attachment, hatred, delusion—are the three kayas in confusion.
[1833] When attachment recognizes its own nature, it is discriminating wisdom.
[1834] When hatred recognizes its own nature, it is mirror-like clarity.
[1835] When delusion recognizes its own nature, it is dharmadhatu expanse.
[1836] The vessels and contents of samsara are primordially pure—
[1837] Merely the delusion of clear appearance without ground.
[1838] When the delusion is cleared away,
[1839] It is called "the manifest stainless luminosity" of Dharmakaya.
[1840] These abide by supporting the face of the nature produced by actions and kleśas. || 90 ||
[1841] Through the support of the all-ground consciousness with its incorrect conceptions,
[1842] They abide in the self-arisen wisdom of mind, the thusness of that.
[1843] Since that does not abide anywhere in particular,
[1844] It is called "self-arisen wisdom" beyond location.
[1845] All these are merely the causes and conditions of samsara, not truly real.
[1846] Knowing their empty nature, one enters the ultimate truth—
[1847] The essence of complete purity which leads to nirvana.
[1848] Yet even nirvana is not a place to reach but recognition itself.
[1849] As the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra declares:
[1850] "All of these are merely the causes and conditions of samsara, not truly real. || 100 ||
[1851] Knowing enumerations of confused appearances as they are,
[1852] Those are designated as the definitive limits of established tenets.
[1853] Yet the Great Perfection transcends all philosophical limits—
[1854] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not two but recognition and non-recognition.
[1855] The worldly vehicle accomplishes temporary happiness.
[1856] The transcendent vehicle accomplishes ultimate liberation.
[1857] Yet the supreme vehicle of Ati is beyond both—
[1858] Spontaneously present from the beginning, not achieved through practice.
[1859] The fixated vehicle of gods and humans accumulates merit.
[1860] The mistaken vehicle of views establishes philosophical positions. || 110 ||
[1861] The vehicle of the Great Perfection cuts through all fixation—
[1862] Not establishing anything, not rejecting anything.
[1863] Recognizing all phenomena as one's own display.
[1864] The aggregates, elements, and faculties are the mandala of self-arisen wisdom.
[1865] The afflictions are the dynamic energy of that wisdom.
[1866] Actions are the play of unobstructed compassion.
[1867] All are liberated into the nature of mind through recognition.
[1868] As it is taught in the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[1869] The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter.
[1870] Thus the Abhidharma is elevated to the view of the Great Perfection:
[1871] Every category points back to mind nature. || 120 ||
[1872] From the Great Tantra of Rigpa Rangshar:
[1873] "Hold fast to the secret vajra!
[1874] My vehicle is immeasurable and vast.
[1875] It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
[1876] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—these alone.
[1877] Yet beyond these two, the great sphere of primordial purity
[1878] Transcends both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's limitations.
[1879] This is the sovereign view of Ati Yoga—
[1880] All phenomena are wisdom-display from the beginning."
[1881] Thus the Abhidharma categories are seen as wisdom's dynamic display.
[1882] Faculties are not mechanical senses but recognition's pathways.
[1883] Afflictions are not defilements but un-recognized wisdom.
[1884] Aggregates are not burdens but the kayas' spontaneous presence.
[1885] This is the definitive meaning of the third chapter— || 130 ||
[1886] All pointing back to the recognition of mind nature itself.
