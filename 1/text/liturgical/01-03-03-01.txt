[1732] First, regarding the faculties arising from form:
[1733] The coarse aggregates arise from the first condition of form-possessing embodiment.
[1734] Five faculties: the eye faculty and so forth, which produce the capability of grasping forms as objects.
[1735] Together with the mind faculty, making six, arising from the first condition of form-possessing knowing.
[1736] Second, regarding the faculties arising from wisdom:
[1737] The portion of knowing that arises as wisdom, capable of engaging objects with clear discernment.
[1738] These are the six: faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, and mental peace.
[1739] Thus it is spoken in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
[1740] Regarding the faculties, there are two main categories:
[1741] The faculty arising from the portion of form, being the support of embodied existence, and
[1742] The faculty arising from the portion of wisdom, being the illumination of awareness.
[1743] The faculty arising from the portion of form is sixfold:
[1744] The eye faculty, holding the coarse earth portion, sees forms.
[1745] The ear faculty, holding the moving wind portion, hears sounds.
[1746] The nose faculty, holding the gathering water portion, smells scents.
[1747] The tongue faculty, holding the ripening fire portion, tastes flavors.
[1748] The mind faculty, holding the pervading space portion, knows phenomena.
[1749] The body faculty, holding the gathering of various portions, feels touch.
[1750] The faculty arising from the portion of wisdom is sixfold:
[1751] The faculty of faith, which lifts up and clarifies the mind completely.
[1752] The faculty of effort, which sharpens and focuses the mind upon the path.
[1753] The faculty of mindfulness, which holds word and meaning without interruption.
[1754] The faculty of concentration, which manifests the emptiness of dharmatā and produces engagement.
[1755] The faculty of wisdom, which engages the meaning of view with discernment.
[1756] The faculty of mental peace, which produces the non-conceptual meaning of reality. Thus it is taught.
[1757] Fifth: The aspects of objects and possessors of objects, being the domain of experience.
[1758] These aspects arise from the interaction of grasped objects and the grasping subject.
[1759] If divided: The portion of phenomenon appearing as the grasped object entity, and
[1760] The portion of dharmatā, being the emptiness of that nature.
[1761] The cognition that is object and not object-possessor knows without duality.
[1762] That, although appearing as object, is free from all extreme grasping and fixation.
[1763] The supreme cognition beyond expression that does not appear as object is non-dual wisdom.
[1764] From the previous classification:
[1765] Objects are twofold:
[1766] The object of entities, appearing as substantial things, and
[1767] The object of emptiness, being the nature of reality.
[1768] Regarding the object of entities:
[1769] These include form, being visible and resistant,
[1770] Sound, being audible and informative,
[1771] Odor, being scents that the nose perceives,
[1772] Taste, being flavors that the tongue knows,
[1773] Phenomena, being the objects of mental cognition,
[1774] The appearance of touch, being tangible qualities,
[1775] The appearance of the four great elements, being earth, water, fire, and wind,
[1776] And the various appearances of entering conditions, being all possible objects.
[1777] Regarding the object of emptiness:
[1778] This is all emptiness, free from all cognition of extreme grasping and fixation.
[1779] The non-objects are twofold:
[1780] Those transcending extremes, being beyond all conceptual limits, and
[1781] 
[1782] Those transcending view, being beyond all philosophical positions.
[1783] What is called "transcending extremes" means not grasping any entity as truly existing self.
[1784] What is called "transcending view" means that which is inexpressible through words and concepts.
[1785] Thus it is taught by the Victorious Ones.
[1786] The divisions being thus:
[1787] Like illusion and dream, appearing as entity yet unestablished in reality.
[1788] Empty by nature, non-existing—merely the delusion of clear appearance without ground.
[1789] The essence of awareness itself, self-arisen wisdom, paradoxically arising from ignorance.
[1790] That essence becomes obscuration when not recognized.
[1791] When the delusion of these appearances is cleared away,
[1792] It is called "the manifest stainless luminosity" of dharmakāya.
[1793] Now, these abide by supporting the face of the nature produced by actions and kleśas.
[1794] That, through the support of the all-ground consciousness with its six or seven groups of incorrect conceptions, abides in the self-arisen wisdom of mind, the thusness of that, in the completely pure self-nature.
[1795] Since that does not abide anywhere in particular, it is called "self-arisen wisdom" beyond location.
[1796] From the Uttara Tantra:
[1797] <prose><tantra> Earth abides in water and wind.
[1798] <prose><tantra> Wind abides excellently in space.
[1799] <prose><tantra> Space is not contained in wind, water,
[1800] <prose><tantra> Nor in the earth element.
[1801] <prose><tantra> Thus, aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleśas.
[1802] <prose><tantra> Actions and kleśas are not ultimately real,
[1803] <prose><tantra> Yet mental activities constantly abide as their display.
[1804] <prose><tantra> The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind.
[1805] <prose><tantra> The phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere at all.
[1806] <prose><tantra> Thus it is taught.
[1807] From that nature arise three types of action:
[1808] White actions, being virtuous and meritorious,
[1809] Black actions, being non-virtuous and demeritorious,
[1810] Mixed actions, combining both white and black.
[1811] Specifically, there are three categories:
[1812] Merit, producing pleasant results,
[1813] Non-merit, producing unpleasant results,
[1814] And the three immovable actions producing form realm results.
[1815] Regarding the action of merit:
[1816] This is merit compatible with producing the pleasurable results of saṃsāra—the ten virtues and so forth.
[1817] Non-merit consists of the ten non-virtues and the five uninterrupted offenses.
[1818] The immovable actions are those producing results in the higher form realms, being unmoving in their results.
[1819] The kleśas are sixfold:
[1820] 
[1821] From the Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[1822] <prose><tantra> The six afflictions are these:
[1823] <prose><tantra> Ignorance is the grasping of the confused conceptual basis as real.
[1824] <prose><tantra> Delusion is confusion arising from the portion of wisdom when not recognized.
[1825] <prose><tantra> Hatred is confusion arising from the stage of generation and becoming.
[1826] <prose><tantra> Pride is confusion arising from the portion of view and self-importance.
[1827] <prose><tantra> Attachment is confusion arising from the portion of appearance and desire.
[1828] <prose><tantra> Jealousy is confusion arising from unmanifest effects and comparison.
[1829] <prose><tantra> And so forth for all afflictions.
[1830] The afflictions are the mind that grasps all thoughts as real.
[1831] The memories are the mind that grasps all recollections as permanent.
[1832] The concepts become the basis of all transitional habitual tendencies and doubts.
[1833] The portions that grasp objects and things, and so forth—are called "immeasurable" in their variety.
[1834] If divided, the conceptual masses generate eighty-four thousand distinct aspects.
[1835] Attachment,
[1836] Hatred,
[1837] Delusion—these three root poisons.
[1838] These portions are equally divided into twenty-one thousand, one thousand, and one thousand respectively.
[1839] All of these, although non-existent in reality, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water in a dream, like confusion itself, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope.
[1840] The vessels, contents, and all afflictions, although non-existent, appear as clear luminosity.
[1841] From the Pearl-Garland:
[1842] <prose><tantra> Thus the various appearances of saṃsāra:
[1843] <prose><tantra> Like seeing a snake where there is only a rope.
[1844] <prose><tantra> Grasping that which is not that as if it were real.
[1845] <prose><tantra> Outer and inner vessels and contents are formed as two distinct realms.
[1846] <prose><tantra> When examined with wisdom, that is merely the rope—the empty nature.
[1847] <prose><tantra> Vessels and contents are primordially empty of inherent existence.
[1848] <prose><tantra> They have the form of ultimate and conventional truths.
[1849] <prose><tantra> Seeing the snake is conventionally true as the deluded perception.
[1850] <prose><tantra> Seeing the rope is ultimately true as the wisdom perception.
[1851] <prose><tantra> Like a bird dwelling on high, seeing the entire landscape.
[1852] <prose><tantra> The nature of the two truths:
[1853] <prose><tantra> Merely the conventional world of appearances.
[1854] <prose><tantra> No inherent relation to the ultimate beyond words.
[1855] <prose><tantra> From the expanse of emptiness,
[1856] <prose><tantra> All aspects of that are liberated into their true nature.
[1857] <prose><tantra> Thus it is taught by the Buddha.
[1858] From the previous teachings:
[1859] "Aggregates are like illusory emanations, lacking true existence."
[1860] Thus it is taught.
[1861] Since vessels, contents, realms, aggregates, and so forth are called "phenomena of cyclic existence,"
[1862] 
[1863] 
[1864] Knowing their empty nature, one enters the ultimate truth—the essence of complete purity—which leads to nirvāṇa.
[1865] Here, from the Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[1866] "All of these are merely the causes and conditions of saṃsāra, not truly real."
[1867] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1868] The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter.
[1869] Thus, knowing the enumerations of confused appearances as they are,
[1870] Those are designated as the definitive limits of established tenets and philosophical systems.
[1871] The extensive explanation of vehicle enumerations:
[1872] From the Great Tantra of Rigpa Rangshar:
[1873] <prose><tantra> "Hold fast to the secret vajra!
[1874] <prose><tantra> My vehicle is immeasurable and vast.
[1875] <prose><tantra> It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
[1876] <prose><tantra> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—these alone."
[1877] The meaning of this teaching has two aspects:
[1878] The worldly vehicle, which accomplishes temporary happiness, and
[1879] The transcendent vehicle, which accomplishes ultimate liberation.
[1880] First, regarding the essence of the worldly vehicle:
[1881] Definition,
[1882] Division,
[1883] Purpose,
[1884] And the five results—these aspects.
[1885] The essence is the definite meaning that dwells in the terminology of enumeration, which attains the results of mental investigation of saṃsāra that does not transcend suffering.
[1886] The definition is engaging and establishing merely the excellence and happiness of the world.
[1887] If divided:
[1888] There are the two vehicles of fixated views and mistaken philosophical positions.
[1889] The purpose is accomplishing one's own temporary results of happiness.
[1890] The result is the method by which one's own result manifests at a certain time through practice.
[1891] The fixated vehicle of gods and humans:
[1892] Through accumulating merit and maintaining the ten virtues and ethical discipline, one accomplishes the method for achieving future happiness of gods and humans.
[1893] Since what is entered becomes a basis for further progress, this is called the fixated vehicle.
[1894] From the Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva:
[1895] <prose><tantra> "The earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans, establishing temporary happiness."
[1896] Regarding the mistaken vehicle:
[1897] From Rangshar, the self-arisen wisdom tantra.
[1898] From the Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva:
[1899] <prose><tantra> "The earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans."
[1900] Regarding the mistaken vehicle of philosophical positions:
[1901] From Rangshar, the tantra of self-arisen wisdom.
