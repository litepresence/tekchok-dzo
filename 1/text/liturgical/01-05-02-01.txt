[4283] First is explained: cutting through the basis,
[4284] Through the sequence of instant faculties,
[4285] Which are primordially liberated, again without basis, and so forth.
[4286] Second is explained: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation,
[4287] Through three preliminaries, bringing one to the natural place, directly bringing one to the self-key, until,
[4288] The body key,
[4289] The door key,
[4290] The object key,
[4291] Relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience,
[4292] Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation. || 10 ||
[4293] Also from that same <tantra>:
[4294] Those directly realizing,
[4295] Are called method—also distinction.
[4296] The person's intellect's difference,
[4297] Shows how the sequence must be explained,
[4298] Without effort and striving, self-liberation,
[4299] With effort, experience must be taken.
[4300] The effortless ones are self-pure.
[4301] The key operates through three aspects,
[4302] That meaning indicates taking experience, || 20 ||
[4303] Through body, door, and object.
[4304] The body's key includes these three,
[4305] The lion's manner, the elephant's manner,
[4306] Like a rishi, must be known.
[4307] The door remains that same, unmoved,
[4308] Clarifying two, unmoved,
[4309] The sky itself unmoved.
[4310] The object's key includes three aspects,
[4311] The pure expanse, dwelling,
[4312] Thus awareness's nature, dwelling, || 30 ||
[4313] All appearances, dwelling.
[4314] Mind remains changeless, self-abiding,
[4315] Mind remains changeless, memory clear,
[4316] Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear,
[4317] Mind, mind, slow—the memory stream ceases.
[4318] Body and speech become slack, free from suffering.
[4319] Awareness becomes slack, five bodies arise.
[4320] Awareness arisen, conditions cease.
[4321] Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.
[4322] Thus is indicated the method's tantra. || 40 ||
[4323] The self's tantra, unproduced and perfected.
[4324] Indicating, thus the method is.
[4325] Dwelling in the stream, thus called tantra.
[4326] Thus.
[4327] Second, the nature's tantra:
[4328] The meaning of basis, path, and fruition.
[4329] From that same <tantra>:
[4330] Basis, path, fruition,
[4331] Determined holding, nature's tantra.
[4332] Thus. || 50 ||
[4333] This essence:
[4334] The empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered.
[4335] The definite term pervades all, accomplishing Buddha-nature, thus called nature's tantra.
[4336] Divided into:
[4337] Basis,
[4338] Essence,
[4339] Quintessence nature's tantra—three.
[4340] The basis nature's tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three.
[4341] That too includes: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent,
[4342] Delusion imputed only, not experienced, || 60 ||
[4343] Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear,
[4344] Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing,
[4345] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
[4346] The essence nature's tantra:
[4347] Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—the basis nature's tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen,
[4348] The path's four appearances actually seen.
[4349] The quintessence nature's tantra:
[4350] Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened.
[4351] That too includes: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone,
[4352] Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established, || 70 ||
[4353] Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent,
[4354] Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence,
[4355] That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
[4356] V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING
[4357] Clear three, and so forth: three kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.
[4358] Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.
[4359] Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.
[4360] Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.
[4361] Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.
[4362] Now the three clear aspects: || 80 ||
[4363] When outer realms appear,
[4364] Awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.
[4365] Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.
[4366] Now the three stabilities:
[4367] Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.
[4368] Nose-held: the stability of realm.
[4369] Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.
[4370] Now the three non-returns:
[4371] When samsara itself is known as primordially Buddha,
[4372] Awareness has no continuum—so no return. || 90 ||
[4373] Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.
[4374] Dharmatā appears as manifold.
[4375] That realization's confidence gained—so no return.
[4376] Now the three appearances:
[4377] Dimension: appearance without day or night.
[4378] Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.
[4379] Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.
[4380] Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for samsara.
[4381] That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of samsara cease of themselves.
[4382] Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—samsara's result dissolves of itself. || 100 ||
[4383] Now the three emptinesses:
[4384] At that time:
[4385] Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.
[4386] Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.
[4387] Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.
[4388] Thus, basis, essence, flower-tantra: shown individually even.
[4389] Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.
[4390] How these three tantras proceed:  As for what is shown as the basis-tantra regarding reality's actual state:  Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer tantra or the basis-tantra is established.
[4391] Realizing: entered the Buddha's tantra.
[4392] Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' tantra. Since that tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-tantra is established. || 110 ||
[4393] The method-tantra too is this portion.
[4394] That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-tantra.
[4395] Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever.
[4396] Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the tantra—
[4397] That itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose.
[4398] Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.
[4399] Such meaning: if the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized.
[4400] If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating tantra.
[4401] That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating.
[4402] Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained. || 120 ||
[4403] "Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so.
[4404] Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's tantra is properly imputed.
[4405] The essence-nature tantra is awareness.
[4406] Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the tantra.
[4407] Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through samsara, so it is tantra.
[4408] The flower-nature tantra:
[4409] Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-tantra.
[4410] Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also tantra.
[4411] The quintessence-nature tantra:
[4412] That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called. || 130 ||
[4413] Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is tantra.
[4414] That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.
[4415] From <tantra>the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras</tantra>:
[4416] The Buddha's all essence gathered,
[4417] Placed into all beings' hearts.
[4418] That essence: the intestine-continuum.
[4419] Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."
[4420] Thus,
[4421] From <tantra>the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra</tantra>:
[4422] All teachings' supreme essence: || 140 ||
[4423] Dharmatā direct-path called.
[4424] Thus,
[4425] From <tantra>the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra</tantra>:
[4426] Basis, essence, flower:
[4427] All Buddhas' nature-tantra.
[4428] Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered.
[4429] This to samsara's far shore,
[4430] Like an arrow-shot person.
[4431] Thus,
[4432] From <tantra>the Supreme Golden Light</tantra>: || 150 ||
[4433] Basis, nature, methods:
[4434] Relying, even to the Buddha-field,
[4435] Effortless, easy—so placed as tantra.
[4436] Thus.
[4437] The Determination of These Meanings
[4438] From <tantra>the Pearl Garland</tantra>:
[4439] Nature-tantra is this:
[4440] Basis, essence, quintessence itself.
[4441] Basis: essence, nature,
[4442] Compassion pervading all, arisen, || 160 ||
[4443] Possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms,
[4444] Primordially pure from stains,
[4445] The unique one of indivisibility.
[4446] All Buddhas' great secret.
[4447] Kāya: perfected essence-awareness.
[4448] Kāya's tantra: pervading emptiness.
[4449] Clarity itself is self-appearance.
[4450] Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature.
[4451] Perfect essence's nature-tantra.
[4452] All appearances are tantra, || 170 ||
[4453] All interconnected and clinging.
[4454] In the mandala of natural citta,
[4455] Unproduced, perfected—great essence.
[4456] Thus, gathered: essence,
[4457] Since become life's breath of all.
[4458] Explained as essence-tantra.
[4459] From <tantra>the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret</tantra>:
[4460] All Buddhas gathered into one,
[4461] All essences extracted,
[4462] Essence gathered—thus called essence, || 180 ||
[4463] Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence.
[4464] All Buddhas' great blissful secret,
[4465] Possessing basis, essence, flower,
[4466] The very essence of all self-awareness.
[4467] Called the Great Perfection's essence,
[4468] Renowned among other tantras.
[4469] The secret tantra explained:
[4470] Scripture held by definite ones.
[4471] Nature empty, all-pervading.
[4472] That too: essence's nature. || 190 ||
[4473] Essence gathered, three clarities,
[4474] Three clarities, pervading cognition.
[4475] Three confidences, three non-returns—
[4476] Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.
[4477] Three appearances, three emptinesses:
[4478] Essence: pure nature.
[4479] Established as tantra.
[4480] Basis, path, result—
[4481] Held definitively: nature-tantra.
[4482] Thus explained, tantra established. || 200 ||
[4483] Established through natural descent.
[4484] Thus called nature-itself tantra.
[4485] Thus,  From the single nature of basis-awareness,  Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.
[4486] THE SEVENTEEN TANTRAS
[4487] From nature: basis and essence.
[4488] Three quintessences, though designated with five different names,
[4489] Are not beyond one meaning-essence.
[4490] From that itself:
[4491] From the distinction of the single basis's essence,
[4492] Are called method and nature tantra. || 210 ||
[4493] Though they appear merely as designations,
[4494] The essence: single basis, empty nature,
[4495] Are not different, have no variation.
[4496] For example, a person—
[4497] If many names exist,
[4498] However called, appears so,
[4499] Meaning unchanged, likewise.
[4500] Thus,
[4501] SECOND: THE WORD TANTRAS, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY
[4502] Three: Enumeration, Purpose, Order. || 220 ||
[4503] Enumeration, Briefly Shown
[4504] Purpose, Explained Extensively
[4505] Order, Determined, Entered and Gathered
[4506] First:
[4507] The self-arisen rigpa's tantra: shown deep and vast as an ocean of expressions.

[4510] The glorious letterless tantra of the mountain-king: shown as the unchanging dharmatā.
[4511] The beautiful-auspicious tantra of the wheel: shown cutting the wheel of delusion.

[4513] The universal-goodness mind-mirror tantra of the sword: shown cutting wrong places.
[4514] The blazing-lamp tantra: shown making the lamp's appearance empty yet bright.
[4515] The jewel-spread tantra of gold-purity: shown as gold adorned with turquoise.

[4522] The Treasury Tantra: whatever desired arises from the wealthy treasury—jewel heap. || 240 ||
[4523] The Razor Tantra: razor-edge cuts whatever it touches, striking contradiction—eighteen wrathful black ones.
[4524] These eighteen wrathful black ones are taught to protect the teachings, arisen from the tantra.
[4525] The other sixteen arise from the root of sudden sound.
[4526] From the cause of great sudden sound:
[4527] Twenty-seven refined lights taught.
[4528] Self-arisen, self-liberated,
[4529] Self-arisen essence, complete power,
[4530] Beautiful, pure, subtly arranged,
[4531] Pearl garland, letterless,
[4532] Space, mind-mirror, || 250 ||
[4533] Sun-moon joined, introduction adorned,
[4534] Body-relic intermediate, jewel heap,
[4535] Blazing lamp, six great spaces—
[4536] Thus the sixteen sequences.
[4537] Arisen certainly from sudden sound, appearing to disciples and sentient beings.
[4538] Thus,
[4539] The Abode of These, Determined:
[4540] From <tantra>the Pearl Garland</tantra>:
[4541] Word tantras, clearly divided in sequence.
[4542] To cut elaboration, samsara's || 260 ||
[4543] Meanings become liberated through tantra.
[4544] Ocean, sun,
[4545] Lion, mountain-king,
[4546] Wheel, key,

[4548] Refined gold, mother-son connection,

[4553] Thus divided by types:
[4554] Word tantras clearly divided.
[4555] Thus,
[4556] SECOND: PURPOSE, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY
[4557] Eleven sections:

[4560] Self-liberated, letterless—three.
[4561] Knowing these three, like a king ruling people—
[4562] Rules tantra-general's meaning. || 280 ||
[4563] That too, letterless: shows tantra-general's upadesha.
[4564] Like a minister turning the reins,
[4565] Self-arisen holds view-meditation-conduct's basis.
[4566] Like subjects doing service and tax,
