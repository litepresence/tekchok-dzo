[4283] First:
[4284] Cutting through the basis,
[4285] The sequence of instant faculties,
[4286] Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera.
[4287] Second: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation,
[4288] Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until,
[4289] Body key,
[4290] Door key,
[4291] Object key,
[4292] Relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience,
[4293] Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation.
[4294] Also from that same:
[4295] Those directly realizing,
[4296] Called method—also distinction.
[4297] Person's intellect's difference,
[4298] How the sequence must be explained,
[4299] Without effort and striving, self-liberation,
[4300] With effort, experience must be taken.
[4301] Effortless ones are self-pure.
[4302] Key: through three aspects,
[4303] That meaning: taking experience,
[4304] Body, door, object.
[4305] Body's key: these three,
[4306] Lion's manner, elephant's manner,
[4307] Like a rishi, must be known.
[4308] Door: that same, unmoved,
[4309] Clarifying two, unmoved,
[4310] Sky itself unmoved.
[4311] Object's key: three aspects,
[4312] Pure expanse, dwelling,
[4313] Thus awareness's nature, dwelling,
[4314] All appearances, dwelling.
[4315] Mind changeless, self-abiding,
[4316] Mind changeless, memory clear,
[4317] Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear,
[4318] Mind, mind, slow—memory stream ceases.


### PAGE 116

[4319] Body and speech slack, free from suffering.
[4320] Awareness slack, five bodies arise.
[4321] Awareness arisen, conditions cease.
[4322] Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.
[4323] Thus indicated method's tantra.
[4324] Self's tantra, unproduced and perfected.
[4325] Indicating, thus method is.
[4326] Dwelling in the stream, thus called tantra.
[4327] Thus.
[4328] Second, nature's tantra:
[4329] The meaning of basis, path, and fruition.
[4330] From that same:
[4331] Basis, path, fruition,
[4332] Determined holding, nature's tantra.
[4333] Thus.
[4334] This essence:
[4335] Empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered.
[4336] Definite term: pervading all, accomplishing buddha-nature, thus called nature's tantra.
[4337] Divided:
[4338] Basis,
[4339] Essence,
[4340] Quintessence nature's tantra—three.
[4341] Basis nature's tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three.
[4342] That too: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent,
[4343] Delusion imputed only, not experienced,
[4344] Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear,
[4345] Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing,
[4346] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
[4347] Essence nature's tantra:
[4348] Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—basis nature's tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen,
[4349] The path's four appearances actually seen.
[4350] Quintessence nature's tantra:
[4351] Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened.
[4352] That too: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone,
[4353] Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established,
[4354] Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent,
[4355] Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence,
[4356] That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
[4357] Clarity three and


### PAGE 117

[4358] V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING
[4359] 4358. Clear three, etcetera: three kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.
[4360] 4359. Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.
[4361] 4360. Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.
[4362] 4361. Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.
[4363] 4362. Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.
[4364] Now the three clear aspects:
[4365] 4364. When outer realms appear,
[4366] 4365. awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.
[4367] 4366. Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.
[4368] Now the three stabilities:
[4369] 4368. Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.
[4370] 4369. Nose-held: the stability of realm.
[4371] 4370. Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.
[4372] Now the three non-returns:
[4373] 4372. When samsara itself is known as primordially Buddha,
[4374] 4373. awareness has no continuum—so no return.
[4375] 4374. Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.
[4376] 4375. Dharmatā appears as manifold.
[4377] 4376. That: realization's confidence gained—so no return.
[4378] Now the three appearances:
[4379] 4378. Dimension: appearance without day or night.
[4380] 4379. Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.
[4381] 4380. Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.
[4382] 4381. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for samsara.
[4383] 4382. That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of samsara cease of themselves.
[4384] 4383. Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—samsara's result dissolves of itself.
[4385] Now the three emptinesses:
[4386] 4384. At that time:
[4387] 4385. Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.
[4388] 4386. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.
[4389] 4387. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.
[4390] 4388. Thus, basis, essence, flower-tantra: shown individually even.
[4391] 4389. Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.
[4392] 4390. How these three tantras proceed:  4391. As for what is shown as the basis-tantra regarding reality's actual state:  4392. Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer tantra or the basis-tantra is established.


### PAGE 118

[4393] 4393. Realizing: entered the Buddha's tantra.
[4394] 4394. Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' tantra. Since that tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-tantra is established.
[4395] 4395. The method-tantra too is this portion.
[4396] 4396. That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-tantra.
[4397] 4397. Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever.
[4398] 4398. Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the tantra—
[4399] 4399. That itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose.
[4400] 4400. Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.
[4401] 4401. Such meaning: if the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized.
[4402] 4402. If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating tantra.
[4403] 4403. That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating.
[4404] 4404. Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained.
[4405] 4405. "Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so.
[4406] 4406. Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's tantra is properly imputed.
[4407] 4407. The essence-nature tantra is awareness.
[4408] 4408. Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the tantra.
[4409] 4409. Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through samsara, so it is tantra.
[4410] 4410. The flower-nature tantra:
[4411] 4411. Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-tantra.
[4412] 4412. Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also tantra.
[4413] 4413. The quintessence-nature tantra:
[4414] 4414. That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called.
[4415] 4415. Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is tantra.
[4416] 4416. That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.


### PAGE 119

[4417] From the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras
[4418] 4417. Buddha's all essence gathered,
[4419] 4418. Placed into all beings' hearts.
[4420] 4419. That essence: the intestine-continuum.
[4421] 4420. Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."
[4422] 4421. Thus,
[4423] From the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra:
[4424] 4423. All teachings' supreme essence:
[4425] 4424. Dharmatā direct-path called.
[4426] 4425. Thus,
[4427] From the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra:
[4428] 4427. Basis, essence, flower:
[4429] 4428. All Buddhas' nature-tantra.
[4430] 4429. Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered.
[4431] 4430. This to samsara's far shore,
[4432] 4431. Like an arrow-shot person.
[4433] 4432. Thus,
[4434] From the Supreme Golden Light:
[4435] 4434. Basis, nature, methods:
[4436] 4435. Relying, even to the Buddha-field,
[4437] 4436. Effortless, easy—so placed as tantra.
[4438] 4437. Thus.
[4439] The Determination of These Meanings
[4440] From the Pearl Garland:
[4441] 4440. Nature-tantra is this:
[4442] 4441. Basis, essence, quintessence itself.
[4443] 4442. Basis: essence, nature,
[4444] 4443. Compassion pervading all, arisen,
[4445] 4444. Possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms,
[4446] 4445. Primordially pure from stains,
[4447] 4446. The unique one of indivisibility.
[4448] 4447. All Buddhas' great secret.
[4449] 4448. Kāya: perfected essence-awareness.
[4450] 4449. Kāya's tantra: pervading emptiness.
[4451] 4450. Clarity itself is self-appearance.
[4452] 4451. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature.
[4453] 4452. Perfect essence's nature-tantra.
[4454] 4453. All appearances are tantra,
[4455] 4454. All interconnected and clinging.
[4456] 4455. In the mandala of natural citta,
[4457] 4456. Unproduced, perfected—great essence.
[4458] 4457. Thus, gathered: essence,
[4459] 4458. Since become life's breath of all.
[4460] 4459. Explained as essence-tantra.
[4461] From the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret
[4462] 4460. All Buddhas gathered into one,
[4463] 4461. All essences extracted,
[4464] 4462. Essence gathered—thus called essence,
[4465] 4463. Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence.
[4466] 4464. All Buddhas' great blissful secret,
[4467] 4465. Possessing basis, essence, flower,
[4468] 4466. The very essence of all self-awareness.
[4469] 4467. Called the Great Perfection's essence,
[4470] 4468. Renowned among other tantras.
[4471] 4469. The secret tantra explained:
[4472] 4470. Scripture held by definite ones.
[4473] 4471. Nature empty, all-pervading.
[4474] 4472. That too: essence's nature.
[4475] 4473. Essence gathered, three clarities,
[4476] 4474. Three clarities, pervading cognition.
[4477] 4475. Three confidences, three non-returns—
[4478] 4476. Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.
[4479] 4477. Three appearances, three emptinesses:
[4480] 4478. Essence: pure nature.
[4481] 4479. Established as tantra.
[4482] 4480. Basis, path, result—
[4483] 4481. Held definitively: nature-tantra.
[4484] 4482. Thus explained, tantra established.
[4485] 4483. Established through natural descent.
[4486] 4484. Thus called nature-itself tantra.
[4487] Thus,  4486. From the single nature of basis-awareness,  4487. Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.


### PAGE 120

[4488] THE SEVENTEEN TANTRAS
[4489] 4488. From nature: basis and essence.
[4490] 4489. Three quintessences, though designated with five different names,
[4491] 4490. Are not beyond one meaning-essence.
[4492] 4491. From that itself:
[4493] 4492. From the distinction of the single basis's essence,
[4494] 4493. Are called method and nature tantra.
[4495] 4494. Though they appear merely as designations,
[4496] 4495. The essence: single basis, empty nature,
[4497] 4496. Are not different, have no variation.
[4498] 4497. For example, a person—
[4499] 4498. If many names exist,
[4500] 4499. However called, appears so,
[4501] 4500. Meaning unchanged, likewise.
[4502] Thus,
[4503] SECOND: THE WORD TANTRAS, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY
[4504] Three: Enumeration, Purpose, Order.
[4505] Enumeration, Briefly Shown
[4506] Purpose, Explained Extensively
[4507] Order, Determined, Entered and Gathered

[4524] The Treasury Tantra: whatever desired arises from the wealthy treasury—jewel heap.
[4525] The Razor Tantra: razor-edge cuts whatever it touches, striking contradiction—eighteen wrathful black ones.
[4526] These eighteen wrathful black ones are taught to protect the teachings, arisen from the tantra.
[4527] The other sixteen arise from the root of sudden sound.
[4528] From the cause of great sudden sound:
[4529] Twenty-seven refined lights taught.
[4530] Self-arisen, self-liberated,
[4531] Self-arisen essence, complete power,
[4532] Beautiful, pure, subtly arranged,

[4559] Eleven sections:


### PAGE 122

[4560] FIRST SECTION: TANTRAS' THREE HEART ESSENCES
[4561] Rigpa self-arisen,
[4562] Self-liberated, letterless—three.
[4563] Knowing these three, like a king ruling people—
[4564] Rules tantra-general's meaning.
[4565] That too, letterless: shows tantra-general's upadesha.
[4566] Like a minister turning the reins,
[4567] Self-arisen holds view-meditation-conduct's basis.
[4568] Like subjects doing service and tax,

[4593] The purpose of turning intermediate delusion.
[4594] SEVENTH: LIMBS' TWO TANTRAS  Jewel heap,  Body-relic blazing.


### PAGE 123

[4595] Like a fence around a fort:
[4596] The purpose of wisdom appearing self-manifest, understood: beauty supreme.
[4597] EIGHTH: YOGIC LIBERATION TANTRAS
[4598] Blazing lamp.
[4599] Like a king residing in a palace, all desires accomplished:
[4600] The purpose of accomplishing all meanings through this knowing.
[4601] NINTH: HEART-LIKE TANTRAS
[4602] Six spaces.
[4603] Like a closed door where thieves find no entry:

[4606] Like iron fence surrounding, cutting all doubts—sudden sound arises.
[4607] ELEVENTH: WEAPON-LIKE TANTRAS
[4608] Black wrathful one.
[4609] Like a good doorkeeper allowing no harm to enter:
