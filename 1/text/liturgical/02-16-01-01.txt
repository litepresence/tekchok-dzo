[685] <prose> From threefold expansion:
[686] Completion is this:
[687] From Self-Arisen,
[688] In Three Kayas' pure appearance,
[689] <verse> One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear;
[691] Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating;
[692] In concept-free awareness, pure;
[693] Five light-rays, unceasing and clear;
[694] In non-grasping great self-liberation, || 10 ||
[695] Outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
[696] In action-released awareness,
[697] Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[698] In mind-separated awareness,
[699] All appearance variety complete in single moment.
[700] In self-appearance's great clear purity,
[701] Deluded appearances complete in single moment. || 20 ||
[702] In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[703] Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[704] Such is Three Kayas' completion manner.
[705] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[706] Awakening is being without dualistic-grasping aspect—
[707] From that same nature:
[708] <verse> Without action, delusion awakens;
[709] Without concept, afflictions awakens;
[710] Without grasping, self-arising awakens;
[711] Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens;
[712] Without attachment, ignorance awakens. || 30 ||
[713] Such is Three Kayas' awakening manner.
[714] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[715] By expansion is meant this:
[716] Qualities, primordially spontaneously accomplished, are expansive—
[717] From Self-Arisen,
[718] <verse> In concept-free awareness,
[719] Five lights clear, wisdom expansive;
[720] In actor-acted-separated awareness,
[721] Without perceived object, Three Kayas expand;
[722] In object-free appearing awareness,
[723] Without grasping mind, five lights expand;
[724] In awareness, great wisdom, || 40 ||
[725] Meaning-possessing self-appearance, fruit expands.
[726] Such is Three Kayas' expansion manner.
[727] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[728] Second: place expansive explanation.
[729] <list> Dharmakaya,
[730] <list> Sambhogakaya,
[731] <list> Nirmanakaya—three places' expansive explanations.

[742] <list> Intent—ten in total.
[743] Essence is this:
[744] Empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence— || 60 ||
[745] From that same nature:
[746] <verse> Unchanging, cessation without, three-pervading—
[747] Dharmakaya essence.
[748] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[749] Definition is this:
[750] Expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light Kaya being—essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion—
[751] Naturally spontaneous, clear-light Kaya, great self-abiding—
[752] From that same nature:
[753] <verse> Fearless, empty, and clear,
[754] All actions complete— || 70 ||
[755] This is Dharmakaya's definition.
[756] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[757] Self-body is this:
[758] Freed from all elaboration extremes, without anywhere accomplishment—
[759] From Self-Arisen:
[760] <verse> Without outer, without inner, without within expanse—
[761] This is Dharmakaya's self-body.
[762] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[763] Metaphor is this:
[764] Like sun through clear-light awareness; || 80 ||
[765] Like ocean through depth;
[766] Like lotus, unstained by defects;
[767] Like mountain, unchanging;
[768] Like space, vast without boundary or center;
[769] Like lion, possessing from primordial the confidence surpassing all—
[770] From that same nature:
[771] <verse> Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] These are Dharmakaya's metaphors.
[774] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 90 ||
[775] Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] From Self-Arisen:
[777] <verse> Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] This is Dharmakaya's self-sign.
[779] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[780] Appearance is like sky-expanse's empty-clarity—
[781] From that same nature:
[782] <verse> Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] This is Dharmakaya's appearance.
[784] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 100 ||
[785] Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] From that:
[787] <verse> Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[788] This is Dharmakaya's place.
[789] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[790] Characteristic is this:
[791] Essence, nature, compassion—three inseparable—
[792] From that same nature:
[793] <verse> Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] This is Dharmakaya's characteristic. || 110 ||
[795] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[796] Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[797] Five lights adorned within, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] In expanse-awareness great inseparability, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] From Self-Arisen:
[800] <verse> Clear, luminous, unmixed—three:
[801] This is Dharmakaya's object.
[802] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[803] Intent is this:
[804] View unsevered by direction or side, || 120 ||
[805] Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[806] Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
[807] Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[808] Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[809] Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[810] Moreover from that same nature:
[811] <verse> Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] This is Dharmakaya's conduct.
[813] <verse> Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] This is Dharmakaya's meditation. || 130 ||
[815] <verse> Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] This is Dharmakaya's view.
[817] <verse> Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] This is Dharmakaya's fruition.
[819] <verse> Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] This is Dharmakaya's enlightened activity.
[821] <verse> One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] These are Dharmakaya's excellence-qualities.
[823] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[824] Second: Sambhogakaya's basis—five expansive explanations: || 140 ||
[825] <list> Essence,
[826] <list> Definitive meaning,
[827] <list> Characteristics,
[828] <list> Appearance mode,
[829] <list> Abiding mode—thus.
[830] First: Essence—from Self-Arisen:
[831] <verse> Birth exists, yet death-free, possessing vajra,
[832] Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear;
[833] Possessing five fathers, five fields, five clusters;
[834] Possessing five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations, || 150 ||
[835] Possessing five bases, five paths, five fruitions,
[836] Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[837] This is Sambhogakaya's complete essence.
[838] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[839] Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[840] In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered.
[841] From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[842] Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[843] Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[844] In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear. || 160 ||
[845] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[846] Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, green.
[847] Five kayas:
[848] <list> Essence-expanse Kaya,
[849] <list> Unchanging Vajra-Kaya,
[850] <list> Dharmakaya,
[851] <list> Sambhogakaya,
[852] <list> Nirmanakaya—five.

[863] <list> Five paths, primordially complete,
[864] <list> Five kayas, primordially established,
[865] <list> Rigpa, primordially arisen, || 190 ||
[866] <list> Five lights, primordially resonant,
[867] <list> Defilements, primordially liberated.
[868] Five knowledges:
[869] From realization's extent,
[870] <list> Know as five kayas,
[871] <list> Know as five wisdoms,
[872] <list> Know as five lights,
[873] <list> Know as self-appearance,
[874] <list> Know as duality-free great liberation.
[875] Five realizations: || 200 ||
[876] <list> Realize field as expanse,
[877] <list> Realize beings as kayas,
[878] <list> Realize appearance as light,
[879] <list> Realize arise-liberation category-free,
[880] <list> Realize wisdom as rigpa.
[881] Five bases:
[882] <list> Light-clear basis: rigpa,
[883] <list> Phenomena basis: all-ground,
[884] <list> Delusion basis: mind,
[885] <list> Path basis: lamp, || 210 ||
[886] <list> Thought basis: wisdom.
[887] Five common paths:
[888] <list> Accumulation path,
[889] <list> Application path,
[890] <list> Seeing path,
[891] <list> Meditation path,
[892] <list> No-more-learning path—five.
[893] Five uncommon paths:
[894] <list> Dharmata path: expanse,
[895] <list> Rigpa path: knowledge, || 220 ||
[896] <list> Light-clear path: two lamps,
[897] <list> Trekcho path: arise-liberation,
[898] <list> Thogal path: expanse-rigpa.
[899] Five fruitions:
[900] <list> Wisdom fruition: liberated in rig,
[901] <list> Light fruition: delusion-appearance ceases,
[902] <list> Realization fruition: delusion-thought clears,
[903] <list> Self-appearance fruition: brought to exhaustion,
[904] <list> Final fruition: dissolves into expanse.
[905] Five abodes: || 230 ||
[906] <list> Thigle abode: heart,
[907] <list> Wisdom abode: crown,
[908] <list> Lamp abode: eyes,
[909] <list> Expanse-appearance abode: sky,
[910] <list> Liberation-place abode: primordial purity.
[911] Five fields:
[912] <list> Rigpa's field: expanse,
[913] <list> Lamp's field: sky,
[914] <list> Wisdom's field: bardo,
[915] <list> Light's field: self-appearance, || 240 ||
[916] <list> Sambhogakaya's field: cluster.
[917] Five essences:
[918] <list> Rigpa's essence: primordial purity,
[919] <list> Wisdom's essence: spontaneous accomplishment,
[920] <list> Light's essence: five aspects,
[921] <list> Wisdom's essence: realization,
[922] <list> Lamp's essence: empty-clarity.
[923] Thus in five aspects appearing, some are Sambhogakaya's essence,
[924] Some are the field,
[925] Some are the method, || 250 ||
[926] Some are the appearance,
[927] Some are wisdom itself—thus Sambhogakaya is explained as one unified essence.
[928] Second, the etymology:
[929] Complete with qualities,
[930] Engaging in pure light-clarity,
[931] Both benefits spontaneously complete,
[932] Wisdom arrived at its full measure,
[933] With marks, signs, radiating light-rays body—the term "five" denotes Sambhogakaya.
[934] From Self-Arisen: || 260 ||

[960] Grasping-free, self-clear, essence-abiding—kaya.
[961] Individual colors, marks, characteristics held—kaya.
[962] Vajra-meaning itself, benefit-endowed—kaya.

[970] From Self-Arisen:
[971] <verse> Individual colors unmixed, marks held,
[972] Marks and exemplary features excellent, light-rays blazing,
[973] Father, mother, kaya-form held—
[974] These are Sambhogakaya's characteristics. || 300 ||
[975] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[976] Fourth, appearance manner:
[977] From rigpa's single nature,
[978] From expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates to directions performing benefit;
[979] Rigpa-kaya, unmoving from expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in self-appearance light-clarity field, the inner-outer appearance manner.
[980] From that same nature:
[981] <verse> In one nature, two essences—
[982] This is Sambhogakaya's appearance.
[983] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[984] Fifth, abiding manner: expanse without acceptance or rejection, || 310 ||
[985] Space without duality,
[986] Five complete lights' vast expanse,
[987] Abiding in emanations-radiating great continuity.
[988] From Self-Arisen:
[989] <verse> Correctly produced, without reference,
[990] Without entering or liberation mind,
[991] How could grasping and engaging exist?
[992] Beyond attachment and fixation words,
[993] Beyond object-abandoning and abandoner-two,
[994] Beyond field, mind, intellect. || 320 ||
[995] In reference-free field,
[996] Self-appearance cuts through words—appearance.
[997] Grasping-free, liberated in its own place,
[998] Emanations enacted in ten directions.
[999] In reference-pure field appearance,
[1000] Wisdom arises in one cut.
[1001] In reference-free field appearance,
[1002] Marks liberate in their own place.
[1003] From that, emanations widely arise.
[1004] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 330 ||
[1005] Third: extensively explained, Nirmanakaya ground—five aspects:
[1006] <list> Essence,
[1007] <list> Etymology,
[1008] <list> Characteristic,
[1009] <list> Division,
