[8687] <prose> First, regarding recognition: when one rests without fabrication through any method, this is not the time for ordinary conceptual flow—therefore it is called the time of shifting recognition.
[8688] Without the flow of ordinary conception,
[8689] The recognition depending upon one's own nature arises without mind having power over it.
[8690] Then, as the actual nature extends and recognition is held, at the time when elaboration has not yet dissolved, special recognition arises; yet the display is not separate from one's own continuum, and since emptiness is not other than mind,
[8691] The mind itself is understood merely as empty display,
[8692] At the time when ordinary conceptions do not exist in one's own mind whatsoever, this is called the time of obtaining recognition.
[8693] Then, when recognition is purified and extended to the measure of arrival,
[8694] As the display spreads and the Mahāmudrā of non-duality of appearance and emptiness is recognized—transcending the intellect—this is called the time of stable recognition.
[8695] However this is recognized, through obtaining power over display, there is no change itself.
[8696] <tantra> Also from before: || 10 ||
[8697] Shifting, obtaining, and stability—
[8698] These proceed to the Ground of the Three Kayas.
[8699] Thus it is.
[8700] <prose> Thirteenth: Thus, having recognized the display, arranging the apertures of recognition and mixing with the natural state, the strength of wisdom expands and one joins with ultimate recognition:
[8701] When recognition tires, return to the natural state;
[8702] At this time, holding recognition and turning awareness inward, resting in the natural state without blocking—
[8703] Through holding recognition inside, mixing with the natural state and not grasping, strength of wisdom expands and so forth arises.
[8704] As this mixes with recognition and is not projected outside, it is a sign of non-extension;
[8705] Like the juice of pounded acacia,
[8706] It will not come forth even when rubbed with sesame oil. || 20 ||
[8707] <verse> Seek subsequent recognition regarding this:
[8708] Joining with ultimate recognition.
[8709] <prose> If, not knowing these keys, one makes the path of recognition relying upon fabricated methods,
[8710] The bindus stray in the body and go to confusion—concepts in reverse, unable to release,
[8711] Thinking that after returning to natural state as a sign of non-extension, confusion goes as fire and the mind is unwell.
[8712] The obstacles of this: recognition contracting, gagging, doing empty conceptualization,
[8713] The mind's nature becoming unwell and turning to confusion,
[8714] Pain in the right recognition and display side, the awareness gathering, and recognition drying hard, difficult to release,
[8715] While doing empty conceptualization, confusion drips from the mind as a side effect.
[8716] <verse> The method to dispel this: || 30 ||
[8717] Turn awareness like a firebrand and rest in "Hriṃ Hriṃ" with the recognition,
[8718] Place the mind at the center of the display,
[8719] Abandon fabrication and throw out elaboration,
[8720] Rest in three natural recognitions and liberation is certain.
[8721] <prose> Fourteenth: For the benefit of recognition, turn the display upward three times;
[8722] At this time, emitting the sound "OṂ AḤ HŪṂ" is the key for the blessings of the Three Kayas to enter recognition itself.
[8723] Regarding that, first: mixing with the Guru's recognition, the student's recognition becomes self-natured.
[8724] <ornament> Thus recognition is the maṇḍala of wisdom-display, not an external diagram but the spontaneous self-arisen wisdom.
