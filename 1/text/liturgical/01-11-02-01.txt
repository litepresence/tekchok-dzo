[13432] First, upon mind, gathering by water-mind holds mindfulness' thought-basis,
[13433] By steadiness, mind's collection gathers,
[13434] Radiating by fire-mind radiates to objects,
[13435] Light by wind-mind moves.
[13436] Upon mind-itself:
[13437] Unborn meaning's mind-itself,
[13438] Unceasing mindfulness's mind-itself,
[13439] Unchanging example-meaning-mixed mind-itself,
[13440] Self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated mind-itself.
[13441] Upon mindfulness, mind and
[13442] Mental two from—
[13443] Mind's mindfulness is as explained before.
[13444] Mental's mindfulness six are:
[13445] Thoroughly-searching mindfulness, pure—clear as god's body,
[13446] Impure—thrown into god's migration,
[13447] Perverted—thrown into wrong-attachment body.
[13448] Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, pure—awareness-holder obtained,
[13449] Impure—born as god-asura,
[13450] Perverted—into butcher's lineage.
[13451] Definitively-placing mental mindfulness, pure—space-dweller.


### PAGE 328

[13452] Impure—human,
[13453] Perverted—into desire-possessing
[13454] Migration thrown.
[13455] Mental-consciousness's mindfulness, pure—mudra-yoga,
[13456] Impure—animal,
[13457] Perverted—wrong-view-possessor.
[13458] Affliction-possessing mind's mindfulness, pure—single-syllable yoga, impure—hungry ghost,
[13459] Perverted—wrong-desire migration.
[13460] Moving-maker-grasping mind's mindfulness, pure—wheel-grasping yoga,
[13461] Impure—hell,
[13462] Perverted—suffering-possessing migration.
[13463] That also, thoroughly-investigating mind with wind-horse, from previous-memory following-grasping arises.
[13464] Definitively-settling mind
[13465] With earth-horse, from past-branched memory arises.
[13466] Definitively-grasping mind, arising with water-horse, from present-memory following-grasping arises.
[13467] Mental-consciousness
[13468] From mind-six's knowing-portion gathering arises,
[13469] With mother-horse arises.
[13470] From present-memory near-pointing arises.
[13471] Affliction-possessor
[13472] With water-earth-two-gathered horse, from future-memory following-grasping arises.
[13473] Moving-maker-grasping mind
[13474] Early-late latencies' aggregate gathered, with fire-wind-two horse, from future-memory branching arises.
[13475] Thus by six ripenings, inside consciousness aggregate-six arose.
[13476] By those from individual gathering, eighteen elements growing obtained,
[13477] Obtained, thus abides.
[13478] From those cause-condition, earth-insect eighty-four thousand arose—
[13479] Body by body produces,
[13480] Speech by speech produces,
[13481] Mind by mind produces—
[13482] From Great Arrangement,
[13483] By three productions, migrators
[13484] Individual ripening completed.
[13485] From elements—pure body,
[13486] From syllable—sound voice spoke,
[13487] From memory-life—mind and so forth.
[13488] Thus.
[13489] That also, insect-based syllable and
[13490] That basis body


### PAGE 329

[13491] Each one abiding as certain basis of body-speech-mind,
[13492] When empowerment and creation-completion meditated, liberation-possible person is called—
[13493] From Entry to Yoga:
[13494] From body and speech and mind itself,
[13495] Yoga seed that complete,
[13496] Here empowerment bestowal is certain.
[13497] Thus it is said.
[13498] Thus upon gathering-memory wheel, collection-dharma root sixteen,
[13499] Wisdom sixteen—thirty-two,
[13500] Syllable sixteen—forty-eight,
[13501] Light-mass sixteen—
[13502] Sixty-four,
[13503] Father sixteen, mother sixteen combined—ninety-six,
[13504] Each father-mother, body-speech-mind gods three-three, gods ninety-six combined—one hundred ninety-two,
[13505] Mind and mental's collection twenty—two hundred twelve,
[13506] Mental's moving-maker action eighteen—two hundred thirty,
[13507] Eighteen elements increase eighteen.
[13508] Two hundred sixty-six,
[13509] Five faculties' basis five,
[13510] Faculties' support five,
[13511] Faculties' doors five combined—two hundred eighty-one,
[13512] Mental's experience, afflictions five-five—thirty combined—three hundred eleven,
[13513] Upon each, mindfulness's radiating and
[13514] Gathering two-two—
[13515] Six hundred twenty-two, eighteen thousand eight and five thousand,
[13516] Upon each, that many syllables,
[13517] That many bodies—four hundred thousand, five ten-thousand, one thousand abiding,
[13518] Inside, disease distinctions cause-condition near-far making,
[13519] Outside, one hundred ten thousand and four ten-thousand hairs producing.
[13520] Those all, basis-all consciousness four-group gathered, from those action-collection,
[13521] Like Vishnu-turtle's form,
[13522] No moving wind at clear faculty-doors,
[13523] No moving power at limb-basis repair—wind's changer not fit for action.
[13524] This itself from increase, moment to moment one hundred twenty thoughts moving measure arose.
[13525] Then also, on the fiftieth day's night going, by water-element's action,


### PAGE 330

[13526] Body's two wheels abandoned, collection-dharmas scattered by wind,
[13527] By water's gatherer gathered as one,
[13528] Like well-conceived embryo-change seed abiding,
[13529] By earth's weight pressed, quaking and shifting, strength deteriorated.
[13530] Then by fire's power heat lowered, hot contact experienced,
[13531] Like blazing fire burning those radiations,
[13532] Made minute particles.
[13533] Then on the third channel-night, by wind's power those minute particles all quaking-moving-shifting,
[13534] Wind gathered inside, scattered all directions, individually separated.
[13535] At this time, four sufferings experienced:
[13536] By water cold-contact made—mere suffering,
[13537] By earth's weight pressed—
[13538] Suffering by suffering,
[13539] By fire burned—changing suffering,
[13540] By wind scattered—falling-fear's cause, formation-suffering.
[13541] Thus by four days, four elements' own power exhausted,
[13542] Two elements gathering's power's time,
[13543] Taste-gathering channel-petal thirty-two individually ripened, within each—wisdom and
[13544] Light and
[13545] Wind's tone and
[13546] Syllable and
[13547] Light-mass and
[13548] Samantabhadra father-mother's body each ripened—
[13549] Arisen without anyone doing—thus "self-arisen" is called.
[13550] Thus by elements gathering, channels generated,
[13551] By channels' power, body generated,
[13552] By body's power, faculties generated,
[13553] By faculties' power, limbs generated,
[13554] By limbs' power, flesh-blood-heat-breath generated,
[13555] By those four—bones,
[13556] Marrow,
[13557] Fat generated,
[13558] By those—skin and
[13559] Lymph and
[13560] Spittle etc. generated,
[13561] By that—tendons,
[13562] Veins,
[13563] Arteries generated,
[13564] By that—sinews generated,
[13565] By that—all-complete bindu generated,
[13566] By that—again body's wind-mind gathering four generated—


### PAGE 331

[13567] Generation stage meditated, body's attachment-maker definite action perform complete.
[13568] Thus Taste-Gathering Wheel, twelve sense-bases' growing accomplish—here fire's action chief,
[13569] Food etc.'s taste-essence produces aggregates, elements, sense-bases and so forth,
[13570] Impurity—feces, urine etc.—discards.
[13571] Sweet taste produces complexion,
[13572] Bitter produces radiance,
[13573] Astringent produces majesty,
[13574] Sour produces strength,
[13575] Pungent produces vitality,
[13576] Salt taste for awakened-mind producing—thus "tastes" are called.
[13577] Gathering is
[13578] Six tastes gathered—food yoga complete.
[13579] Six migrations' portion in humans complete—crucial point.
[13580] Wheel is
[13581] Food taste here gathers.
[13582] Year is
[13583] Three years trained, essence extraction complete.
[13584] Therefore Taste-Gathering Wheel thus called.
[13585] Then on day fifty-six, elements' fire heat moves,
[13586] Wind spreads heat, body's ripening like frog-form, sense-power clear but sense-power strength not obtained,
[13587] Limbs arose, moving wind not obtained.
[13588] At this time, eighty-five thousand fire-insects formed—
[13589] To body-possessors, body emanates.
[13590] Thus it is said.
[13591] Thus collection-dharma definitively joined—
[13592] Thirty-two channels, thirty-two syllables—sixty-four,
[13593] Thirty-two light-spheres—ninety-six,
[13594] Samantabhadra father-mother sixty-four—
[13595] One hundred sixty complete.
[13596] Each father-mother, body-speech-mind gods and wisdom-beings four added—
[13597] Four hundred twenty-six,
[13598] Twelve sense-bases action-connection change-recognize number twenty-twenty—
[13599] Two hundred forty,
[13600] Combined—six hundred sixty-six.


### PAGE 332

[13601] From those maturing's certainty distinctions,
[13602] Eighty-five thousand affliction-latencies,
[13603] Their cause—eighty-five thousand fire-insects.
[13604] Each of those, one syllable,
[13605] One body,
[13606] From that body maturing, one wisdom-being
[13607] Abiding in heart-center.
[13608] Thus insect body-increasing and
[13609] Affliction-thought-basis two—three hundred thousand, three ten-thousand half and three,
[13610] Taste wheel etc. dharmas—three hundred thousand, three ten-thousand,
[13611] One hundred sixty-six abode.
[13612] Thus collection measure-not-having—"basis-of-all" called.
[13613] That also, on fifty-seventh day's night, water gathered those as one,
[13614] Earth pressed and steadied,
[13615] Fire burned nine channels,
[13616] Wind individually separated.
[13617] Two months passed, elements pacify-action power exhausted,
[13618] Again two elements gathering does.
[13619] Two months three days, upon Peak-Arranged Wheel, from eight channels, forty-five own-face channels five-five increasing,
[13620] Thirty-eight channel-petals, sixty full, body's outside-inside all spread,
[13621] Distinction channels' spread and
[13622] Common spreads all arose.
[13623] Those channels upward move and
[13624] Downward throw and
[13625] Sideward rise and
[13626] Agitate and
[13627] Coil and
[13628] Straight and
[13629] Thick and
[13630] Thin and
[13631] Branch-possessing all by means of—
[13632] Blood and
[13633] Lymph and
[13634] Breath's support and
[13635] Ride cause-do.
[13636] Change-do and
[13637] Long-short and
[13638] Leap's action do is
[13639] Seventy-two—throw wind's action do.
[13640] Change and
[13641] Shift and
[13642] Increase is
[13643] Disease's gathering-cause various make.
[13644] Change and
[13645] Steal and
[13646] Grasp—affliction self-possessing action do.
[13647] Full and


### PAGE 333

[13648] Empty and
[13649] Clearing—essence-impurity separating action does.
[13650] Trembling and
[13651] Coiling and
[13652] Gapping—
[13653] Bliss and
[13654] Suffering and
[13655] Equanimity's action does.
[13656] Thus channel-wheel gathered center, syllable self-sound and
[13657] Light's tone stirred from,
[13658] Varied white-red light-wheel stirred,
[13659] From five sense-powers individual grasping channels,
[13660] From five sense-power doors, self-syllable lights stirred,
[13661] Varied bliss-suffering branched blazing becomes.
[13662] Those channels all inside, wisdom-nature abiding or path-abiding—not actual,
[13663] Wisdom's tone or potency pervaded, like sesame-oil pervaded or sun-ray spark.
[13664] Channel's self-face wisdom's potency, view-meditation-conduct basis abides.
[13665] Thus two elements gathering action done, body's sense-powers and
[13666] Limbs and
[13667] Skin and
[13668] Hair etc. well produced.
[13669] Then seven-nine and day four passed time,
[13670] By wind's power movement and
[13671] Limbs moving action becomes,
[13672] Mother's flesh-blood essence-food activity arose.
[13673] This time, all-ground consciousness aggregate-basis, pure enjoyment, objects and sense-powers near-taking only became.
[13674] Thus body-tip is head, there channel-enumeration syllable-connection like arranged—Peak-Arranged Wheel thus called.
[13675] Those individual agents aggregate, eighty-five thousand wind-insects,
[13676] By syllable power stirred and
[13677] By wind power moved and
[13678] Food near-takes and
[13679] Body individual going-moving arose, body-existing power, those insects individual consciousness clear arose.
[13680] Previous insects also thus.
[13681] Those insects wind-change and


### PAGE 334

[13682] Emptying and
[13683] Contracting and
[13684] Stabbing and
[13685] Coiling from,
[13686] Body's elements stirred,
[13687] Wind and
[13688] Bile and
[13689] Phlegm and
[13690] Combined diseases take,
[13691] Bliss-suffering ripen.
[13692] Those enumerations divided—sixteen become,
[13693] That itself male-female change divided—thirty-two female diseases become,
[13694] From those change-numbers, four hundred four common diseases branched.
[13695] Thus Peak-Arranged Wheel, three hundred sixty channels inside,
[13696] Ka ka ki ki
[13697] Etc. syllables seven hundred twenty abide,
[13698] Three hundred sixty light-spheres combined—one thousand eighty,
[13699] Samantabhadra father-mother two thousand eight hundred bodies, each body-speech-mind gods three-three,
[13700] From heart-center wisdom-beings hair-drawn form like each,
[13701] Three thousand two hundred forty complete,
[13702] Eight ten-thousand five thousand insects,
[13703] That many syllables, inside each individual wisdom-seed that many,
[13704] Three hundred thousand, three ten-thousand half and three.
[13705] This time, scripture-not-shown afflictions—eight ten-thousand five thousand,
[13706] Four hundred thousand, one ten-thousand.
[13707] Above channel-growing three thousand two hundred forty,
[13708] Three hundred thousand, one ten-thousand, three thousand, two hundred forty complete abode.
[13709] Sense-powers and sense-power basis dharmas, enumeration measure-not gathered—"basis-of-all" called.
[13710] Thus four body-wheels' channels life-tree taste single all-trembling three by means of,
[13711] Outside body-speech-mind three produced,
[13712] Inside body-speech-mind three produced,
[13713] Secret emanation body,
[13714] Enjoyment body,
[13715] Dharma body three produced—pillar-manner straight abides.
[13716] That also father's bindu syllable A-Om Ah-Hung sound emerged, mother's castle dissolves.


### PAGE 335

[13717] Mother's condition also with three seed-syllables' sound,
[13718] Six sounds gathered inside, child's body-speech-mind basis from taste-single all-trembling central channel's inside, Om and light and Samantabhadra father-mother's body three complete,
[13719] Right side Ah and light and three bodies,
[13720] Left side Hung and light and three bodies complete—
[13721] Body-speech-mind three-three's support complete.
[13722] Thus from four wheels, first body etc. basis-of-all produced navel and
[13723] Then consciousness complete, thus memory-gathering heart and
[13724] Memory's taste experienced, speech-maker arose, thus tastes throat and
[13725] All's peak variety-arranged crown—four measure determined.
[13726] That also, channels' inside syllables from wind's sound moved,
[13727] Voice arises,
[13728] Clear syllables are sweet voice.
[13729] Unclear, unpleasant,
[13730] From channel-syllable impure, voice trembles,
[13731] Pure and
[13732] With peak etc. arises.
[13733] From channel's vital point changed,
[13734] Males' thick voice—no caste channel and channel-space wide, thus thick.
[13735] That also wide and
[13736] Very wide and
[13737] 
[13738]

[13752] Male children gaze from mother's right lung inward,
[13753] Female children from the left gaze outward, thus abiding—
[13754] Holding to their own home,
[13755] Going to other's homes, from dependent-origination's action arose.
[13756] Then boys at nine months and ten days are born,
[13757] Girls at nine months born,
[13758] Wind from avadhuti through right-left nose-channels actually moving,
[13759] Afflictions increasingly coarse become,
[13760] Abiding as storehouse of many actions.
[13761] That also, conventional elements four mature the body—
[13762] From earth flesh actually completes,
[13763] From water blood,
[13764] From fire warmth,
[13765] From wind breath actually completes.
[13766] From flesh delusion,
[13767] From blood desire-attachment,
[13768] From heat anger,
[13769] From breath pride,
[13770] Jealousy etc. thoughts different as cause-condition arise.
[13771] From desire-attachment body actually matures—
[13772] First, by desire-attachment all motivated, from that arose.
[13773] From anger blood matures—
[13774] First, depending on anger, speaking sound, from that arose.
[13775] From delusion mind variously matures—
[13776] First, from basis ignorance, confusion, from that arose.
[13777] Thus three also, riding breath's horse, going,
[13778] Three poisons' thoughts different arise.
[13779] That also, delusion's mature-place, sleep arises,
[13780] Desire-attachment's mature-place, laughing when arises,
[13781] Anger's mature-place, various dreams arise.
[13782] Flesh generated by delusion's sign—going flesh all big, sleep big,
[13783] Heat generated by anger's sign—outside moon heat-moisture arriving time, dreams many.
[13784] Anger arising time, body light warmth arises, speech speaking diligent.
[13785] Blood generated by desire-attachment's sign—depending on blood's moving, agitation arises,
[13786] Desire-attachment arising time, moisture dust etc. moist part arises.
[13787] That also, depending on flesh, form's aggregate spreads,


### PAGE 337

[13788] From blood perception,
[13789] From heat consciousness,
[13790] From breath formations,
[13791] Depending on wind outward completing, feeling spreads.
[13792] That also, flesh generates channel,
[13793] Channel generates wind,
[13794] Wind generates both action and wisdom.
[13795] Action gathers samsara,
[13796] Wisdom gathers nirvana.
[13797] That also, depending on blood lymph generates,
[13798] That generates bindu,
[13799] Bindu generates conventional mature-place five faculties,
[13800] Faculties' cause five afflictions,
[13801] Condition five objects,
[13802] Past future present thought-collections gathered, samsara-nirvana's cause arose.
[13803] That-to ultimate elements four—
[13804] From white color greatly spreading,
[13805] Far-lasso water-lamp's cause made,
[13806] From earth channel arose.
[13807] From greatly red, empty bindu lamp's cause made,
[13808] From water channel arose.
[13809] From greatly yellow, pure space lamp's cause made,
[13810] From fire-wind channel arose.
[13811] From greatly green color,
[13812] Self-arisen wisdom lamp's cause made,
[13813] From wind channel arose.
[13814] That also, self-arisen wisdom generates awareness,
[13815] Far-lasso generates light,
[13816] Bindu generates body,
[13817] Space generates wisdom.
[13818] Far-lasso's dharmata direct appearance seen,
[13819] Empty bindu experience increase seen,
[13820] Space awareness measure arrived seen,
[13821] Self-arisen wisdom lamp engages dharmata-exhausted appearance.
[13822] Those also, from door-eye wisdom arose, actually engage.
