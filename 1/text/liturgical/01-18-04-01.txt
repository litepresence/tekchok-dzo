[4468] 4466. The very essence of all self-awareness.
[4469] 4467. Called the Great Perfection's essence,
[4470] 4468. Renowned among other tantras.
[4471] 4469. The secret Tantra explained:
[4472] 4470. Scripture held by definite ones.
[4473] 4471. Nature empty, all-pervading.
[4474] 4472. That too: essence's nature.
[4475] 4473. Essence gathered, three clarities,
[4476] 4474. Three clarities, pervading cognition.
[4477] 4475. Three confidences, three non-returns—
[4478] 4476. Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.
[4479] 4477. Three appearances, three emptinesses:
[4480] 4478. Essence: pure nature.
[4481] 4479. Established as Tantra.
[4482] 4480. Basis, path, result—
[4483] 4481. Held definitively: nature-Tantra.
[4484] 4482. Thus explained, Tantra established.
[4485] 4483. Established through natural descent.
[4486] 4484. Thus called nature-itself Tantra.
[4487] Thus,  4486. From the single nature of basis-awareness,  4487. Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.
[4488] THE SEVENTEEN TANTRAS
[4489] 4488. From nature: basis and essence.
[4490] 4489. Three quintessences, though designated with five different names,
[4491] 4490. Are not beyond one meaning-essence.
[4492] 4491. From that itself:
[4493] 4492. From the distinction of the single basis's essence,
[4494] 4493. Are called method and nature Tantra.
[4495] 4494. Though they appear merely as designations,
[4496] 4495. The essence: single basis, empty nature,
[4497] 4496. Are not different, have no variation.
[4498] 4497. For example, a person—
[4499] 4498. If many names exist,
[4500] 4499. However called, appears so,
[4501] 4500. Meaning unchanged, likewise.
[4502] Thus,
