[9027] <ornament> First:
[9028] <prose> Sitting cross-legged, placing upon red-clear, clear, round light-appearance by thumb-and-finger pressing, taking as experience.
[9029] <prose> Making sessions short, the number many.
[9030] <prose> Releasing thumb-and-finger effort, looking slowly.
[9031] <prose> Seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance.
[9032] <prose> <tantra> From that same source:
[9033] <prose> <tantra> By one's own thumb and finger,
[9034] <prose> <tantra> Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[9035] <prose> <tantra> What arises from that pressing
[9036] <prose> <tantra> Is dharmatā's directly manifest appearance. || 10 ||
[9037] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9038] <prose> Entering clearly:
[9039] <prose> Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] <prose> Like dull illusion,
[9041] <prose> Like hovering clouds,
[9042] <prose> Like emanating fire sparks,
[9043] <prose> Sun and moon,
[9044] <prose> Like star forms,
[9045] <prose> Like intermediate-space rainbow,
[9046] <prose> White clear light, || 20 ||
[9047] <prose> Yellow clear,
[9048] <prose> Red clear,
[9049] <prose> Green clear,
[9050] <prose> Blue,
[9051] <prose> Various,
[9052] <prose> Net pattern,
[9053] <prose> Arising rays,
[9054] <prose> Round gatherings,
[9055] <prose> Bindus,
[9056] <prose> Stupas, || 30 ||
[9057] <prose> God-bodies,
[9058] <list> At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here and there, far and near,
[9059] <prose> By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[9060] <prose> <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[9061] <prose> <tantra> From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[9062] <prose> <tantra> Also of color and shape,
[9063] <prose> <tantra> Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[9064] <prose> <tantra> Certainly expanding from above to above.
[9065] <prose> <tantra> At this time, body-speech bliss signs.
[9066] <prose> <tantra> Join with appearance measure and manner. || 40 ||
[9067] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9068] <prose> Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
