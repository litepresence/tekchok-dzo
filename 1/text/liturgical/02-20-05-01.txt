[9027] First:
[9028] Sitting cross-legged, placing upon red-clear, clear, round light-appearance by thumb-and-finger pressing, taking as experience.
[9029] Making sessions short, the number many.
[9030] Releasing thumb-and-finger effort, looking slowly.
[9031] Seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance.
[9032] <tantra> From that same source:
[9033] <tantra> By one's own thumb and finger,
[9034] <tantra> Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[9035] <tantra> What arises from that pressing
[9036] <tantra> Is dharmatā's directly manifest appearance. || 10 ||
[9037] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9038] Entering clearly:
[9039] Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] Like dull illusion,
[9041] Like hovering clouds,
[9042] Like emanating fire sparks,
[9043] Sun and moon,

[9056] Stupas, || 30 ||
[9057] God-bodies,
[9058] At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here and there, far and near,
[9059] By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[9060] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[9061] <tantra> From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[9062] <tantra> Also of color and shape,
[9063] <tantra> Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[9064] <tantra> Certainly expanding from above to above.
[9065] <tantra> At this time, body-speech bliss signs.
[9066] <tantra> Join with appearance measure and manner. || 40 ||
[9067] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9068] Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
