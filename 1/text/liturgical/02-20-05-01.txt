[9027] First:
[9028] Sitting cross-legged, placing upon red-clear, clear, round light-appearance by thumb-and-finger pressing, taking as experience.
[9029] Making sessions short, the number many.
[9030] Releasing thumb-and-finger effort, looking slowly.
[9031] Seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance.



<tantra> [9032] From that same source:
<tantra> [9033] By one's own thumb and finger,
<tantra> [9034] Press the bindu-empty lamp.
<tantra> [9035] What arises from that pressing
<tantra> [9036] Is dharmatā's directly manifest appearance.
<tantra> [9037] Thus it is spoken.



[9038] Entering clearly:
[9039] Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] Like dull illusion,
[9041] Like hovering clouds,
[9042] Like emanating fire sparks,



[9043] Sun and moon,

[9056] Stupas,
[9057] God-bodies,
[9058] At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here and there, far and near,
[9059] By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.



<tantra> [9060] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [9061] From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
<tantra> [9062] Also of color and shape,
<tantra> [9063] Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
<tantra> [9064] Certainly expanding from above to above.
<tantra> [9065] At this time, body-speech bliss signs.
<tantra> [9066] Join with appearance measure and manner.
<tantra> [9067] Thus it is spoken.



[9068] Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
