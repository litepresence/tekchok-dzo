[9027] First:
[9028] Sitting cross-legged, placing upon red-clear, clear, round light-appearance by thumb-and-finger pressing, taking as experience.
[9029] Making sessions short, the number many.
[9030] Releasing thumb-and-finger effort, looking slowly.
[9031] Seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance.
[9032] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9033] <prose><tantra> By one's own thumb and finger,
[9034] <prose><tantra> Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[9035] <prose><tantra> What arises from that pressing
[9036] <prose><tantra> Is dharmatā's directly manifest appearance.
[9037] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9038] Entering clearly:
[9039] Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[9040] Like dull illusion,
[9041] Like hovering clouds,
[9042] Like emanating fire sparks,
[9043] Sun and moon,
[9044] Like star forms,

[9054] Round gatherings,
[9055] Bindus,
[9056] Stupas,
[9057] God-bodies,
[9058] At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here and there, far and near,
[9059] By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[9060] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[9061] <prose><tantra> From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[9062] <prose><tantra> Also of color and shape,
[9063] <prose><tantra> Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[9064] <prose><tantra> Certainly expanding from above to above.
[9065] <prose><tantra> At this time, body-speech bliss signs.
[9066] <prose><tantra> Join with appearance measure and manner.
[9067] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9068] Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
