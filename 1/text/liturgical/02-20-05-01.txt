[8972] <prose> First indeed</prose>
[8973] <prose> Sitting cross-legged, pressing with thumb and finger upon red-clear, clear, round light-appearance, take as experience.</prose>
[8974] <prose> Make sessions short, the number many.</prose>
[8975] <prose> Releasing thumb-and-finger effort, look slowly.</prose>
[8976] <prose> Seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance.</prose>
[8977] <tantra> From that same source:</tantra>
[8978] <verse> By one's own thumb and finger,</verse>
[8979] <verse> Press the bindu-empty lamp.</verse>
[8980] <verse> What arises from that pressing</verse>
[8981] <verse> Is dharmatā's directly manifest appearance. || 10 ||</verse>
[8982] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[8983] <prose> Entering clearly:</prose>
[8984] <prose> Then from five-light appearance: first like smoke,</prose>
[8985] <prose> Like dull illusion,</prose>
[8986] <prose> Like hovering clouds,</prose>
[8987] <prose> Like emanating fire sparks,</prose>
[8988] <prose> Sun and moon,</prose>
[8989] <prose> Like star forms,</prose>
[8990] <prose> Like intermediate-space rainbow,</prose>
[8991] <prose> White clear light, || 20 ||</prose>
[8992] <prose> Yellow clear,</prose>
[8993] <prose> Red clear,</prose>
[8994] <prose> Green clear,</prose>
[8995] <prose> Blue,</prose>
[8996] <prose> Various,</prose>
[8997] <prose> Net pattern,</prose>
[8998] <prose> Arising rays,</prose>
[8999] <prose> Round gatherings,</prose>
[9000] <prose> Bindus,</prose>
[9001] <prose> Stupas, || 30 ||</prose>
[9002] <prose> God-bodies,</prose>
[9003] <prose> At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here and there, far and near,</prose>
[9004] <prose> By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.</prose>
[9005] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[9006] <verse> From that, wisdom-expanding experience,</verse>
[9007] <verse> Also of color and shape,</verse>
[9008] <verse> Pervading all outer and inner clearly,</verse>
[9009] <verse> Certainly expanding from above to above.</verse>
[9010] <verse> At this time, body-speech bliss signs.</verse>
[9011] <verse> Join with appearance measure and manner. || 40 ||</verse>
[9012] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[9013] <prose> Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:</prose>
