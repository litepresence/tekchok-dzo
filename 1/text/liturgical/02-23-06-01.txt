[13701] At the time of initial extension, awareness proceeds outward;
[13702] At the time of dissolution, these return inward and enter.
[13703] The instruction is thus: like external veils, these lights
[13704] Dissolve into the heart of the Self-Aware Mother, entering the lap as a child—
[13705] Merging into Dharmata, this is called liberation upon the Ground of Primordial Purity.
[13706] These, when joined with definitive scriptural authority,
[13707] <tantra> From the Sun Moon Union:
[13708] "That also, the clear light of the person dissolving into union."</tantra>
[13709] Moreover, these Appearances self-arise as the Appearance of Kāya,
[13710] Those Kāyas neither large
[13711] Nor small,
[13712] Equal in measure, together with ornaments,
[13713] Colors,
[13714] Postures,
[13715] Seats and thrones,
[13716] Each with their own mudrā—
[13717] All those Kāyas pervaded by pairs of fives,
[13718] Each group of five with halos of light,
[13719] The class holding the father's aspect,
[13720] The class holding the mother's aspect,
[13721] Sattvas,
[13722] Sattvīs,
[13723] All maṇḍalas complete in one Realm.
[13724] At that time, from one's own heart center, an extremely subtle light arises,
[13725] That light connecting to the heart of all Kāyas and shining forth.
[13726] By that, one's own awareness is grasped,


### PAGE 323

[13727] Abiding naturally in nonconceptual samādhi.
[13728] This is called entering Awareness into the light.
[13729] All those Appearances become extremely agitated,
[13730] And upon those heart-ray threads, countless subtle bindus arise.
[13731] Then again, from one's own heart center, light-ray threads like twisted silk arise,
[13732] Then the Appearance arises that all those Kāyas dissolve into one's own body.
[13733] This is called entering the light back into Awareness.
[13734] At this time, the person should recall the supreme method, like a child entering the mother's lap, with conviction.
[13735] Third, the Appearance of the Fourfold Yoga of Wisdom is called dissolving into the Wisdom of Union. Regarding the mode of Appearance arising
[13736] And the mode of recollecting the instruction, there are two.
[13737] The Appearance: again, from the heart center, about four finger-widths above, a subtle light of four colors intertwined arises like a horse-hair lute string,
[13738] Appearing to pierce into the space above.
[13739] Looking at that with the eye of prajñā,
[13740] From that subtle Appearance, fully extending, individually distinct and greatly spreading,
[13741] From the essence of that initial subtlety not transforming, the aspect greatly extending—
[13742] A lapis lazuli veil, large and small, to the extent of the scope of one's own faculties,
[13743] Distinct from other colors, appears directly before oneself.
[13744] This is the Appearance of the Wisdom of Dharmadhātu.
[13745] Upon that, the essence of the Wisdom of Dharmadhātu—white bindu-rays,
[13746] Red,
[13747] Yellow,
[13748] And blue, having four,
[13749] Large and small, the measure of a covered mirror-face, the five lights extremely clear,
[13750] Radiant with the light-rays of Wisdom,
[13751] The essence having the self-complete potency of five wisdoms,
[13752] That bindu naturally possessing bindus of five lights,
[13753] Subtle, ornamented by fives of fives in the four directions and center, like a mustard seed amulet.
[13754] This is the essence of the Wisdom of Dharmadhātu.


### PAGE 324

[13755] That essence also comprises knowable phenomena, possessing individual and general characteristics,
[13756] And experienced phenomena manifesting.
[13757] Dhātu also: outer dhātu, empty space without substantial existence,
[13758] And inner dhātu, the clear light lamp of purity directly arising.
[13759] Wisdom: the meaning existent from the beginning manifesting at that time—this is knowing.
[13760] Therefore, the wisdom of holding characteristics,
[13761] Color,
[13762] Kāya,
[13763] And individual characteristics of Dharmatā, holding without abandoning.
[13764] Then again, upon that, without touching but connecting, the mirror-like wisdom deep-glowing white veil,
[13765] Large and small, equal to the scope of faculties, difficult to gaze upon, radiant and distinct from others, upon which
[13766] Clear bindus of five lights, like a covered mirror-face,
[13767] Having white and blue and so forth, five rays,
[13768] Radiant with deep-glowing wisdom in the four directions and center,
[13769] The natural potency of five wisdoms complete, ornamented by five natural bindus like mustard seeds.
[13770] From mirror-like wisdom:
[13771] The mirror causes forms to appear,
[13772] Whatever reflection appears upon it,
[13773] Is not Awareness itself,
[13774] Because it causes the reflection of that itself to appear, the mirror is a metaphor.
[13775] The reflection, self-radiant, knowing itself when present—this is Wisdom.
[13776] Then again, upon the yellow light-ray veil, large and small, equal to the scope of faculties, yellow and distinct from others,
[13777] Again bindus of five lights self-clear,
[13778] Large and small, like a covered mirror-face, white and
[13779] Blue and
[13780] Yellow and
[13781] Red rays spreading,
[13782] Radiant with the deep-glowing of Wisdom itself,
[13783] That bindu itself in four directions and center, as natural bindus like mustard seeds, ornamented by the natural potency of wisdom—this appears as before.
[13784] This arises as the deep-glowing of the Wisdom of Equality.


### PAGE 325

[13785] The cause of equality,
[13786] The condition of equality,
[13787] The time of equality,
[13788] From these four equalities:
[13789] Equal cause—saṃsāra-nirvāṇa phenomena of appearance-existence,
[13790] Equal condition—familiarity with Dharmatā,
[13791] Equal time—realization manifesting,
[13792] Equal self-awareness,
[13793] Dwelling in equality itself—this is established as the recognition.
[13794] Dharmatā cannot be found as fabricated by anything, cannot be superimposed by thought or word.
[13795] Wisdom:
[13796] That abiding equally from the beginning, known at this time,
[13797] Is characteristic certainty.
[13798] Upon that, without touching but connecting, upon the red veil, large and small, to the scope of faculties, extremely clear light,
[13799] The essence of discriminating wisdom—bindu of five lights extremely clear, like a covered mirror-face, five-colored rays spreading,
[13800] Radiant with deep-glowing wisdom,
[13801] That itself in four directions and center, ornamented by natural bindus like mustard seeds—appears as before.
[13802] That also, individually: twenty-one faculties of superior, middling, and lesser,
[13803] Gathered from those, nine,
[13804] Gathered from those, three of superior, middling, and lesser,
[13805] Extremely gathered from those, the two—Awareness self-appearance and
[13806] Referential object-cognizing mind—
[13807] The referential object-cognizing mind realizes the path as subsequent attainment,
[13808] Awareness self-appearance realizes the path of equipoise directly.
[13809] Thus, by direct and subsequent attainment, that meaning existent from the beginning,
[13810] Now, arising from characteristic certainty, is knowing.
[13811] The wisdom of accomplishing activity, from the seed-portion, potency incomplete, completes in Primordial Purity.
[13812] That also, existing merely as the resonance-portion of gathered two lights,
[13813] All five wisdom Appearances explained in universal clarity.
[13814] Here, joining with not yet liberated in Primordial Purity, established as fourfold yoga,
[13815] Those of coarse mind holding that there is no Appearance of accomplishing activity—this is extremely unreasonable.
[13816] If potency incomplete does not appear, then all would not appear—it follows,


### PAGE 326

[13817] Because potency never completes at the time of reaching the end of all potency.
[13818] Therefore, here the fourfold yoga Appearance of one's own ground,
[13819] Not liberated, potency incomplete—understanding this meaning, one should accept as fourfold yoga of Wisdom.
[13820] Then, seeing the Spontaneous Presence jewel-Appearance portion,
[13821] Until the actual result is incomplete, in Appearance as qualities of four wisdoms,
[13822] Five wisdom aspects of accomplishing activity do not appear,
[13823] Seed potency existing, five wisdom aspects arise.
[13824] That also, because the seed of five wisdoms pervades all those.
[13825] Upon the four veils of four wisdoms, upon four bindus, above those, five small bindus like maṇḍala heaps arranged.
[13826] Upon those, a round light like a peacock umbrella is the Appearance of the Dhātu of five wisdoms,
[13827] The center blue, circled by five-colored aureole, appears.
[13828] This arises at this time as the seed of Spontaneous Presence arising.
[13829] These are called the path of Vajrasattva's central channel.
[13830] Second, the mode of recollecting the instruction:
[13831] Knowing all these Appearances as unchanging self-appearance, immediately establishing equality thereupon,
[13832] Like a golden needle drawing heart-blood, relying on the mother's instruction, in the intermediate state, one's own Appearance certain, liberated.
[13833] <tantra> These also, from the Sun Moon Union:
[13834] "Again, from one's own heart center, an extremely subtle light-thread arises,
[13835] That appears to pierce upward into the space above."</tantra>
[13836] Looking at that with one's own eye, undistracted,
[13837] Those Appearances distinctly appear extremely vast,
[13838] That also, upon the lapis lazuli veil,
[13839] Bindu possessing rays, like a covered mirror-face,
[13840] Extremely clear and radiant,
[13841] Ornamented by five natural bindus.
[13842] Again, upon that, upon the white veil, bindu extremely clear appears as before.
[13843] Upon the yellow veil, bindu also appears as before.
[13844] Upon that, upon the red veil, bindu appears as before.
[13845] Upon that, an extremely clear round light appears like an umbrella.
[13846] These also are aspects of five wisdoms,
[13847] The potency of accomplishing activity wisdom incomplete, therefore not appearing.
[13848] This is called the Appearance of the Fourfold Yoga of Wisdom,


### PAGE 327

[13849] Called the path of Vajrasattva's central channel.
[13850] At that time, the supreme method like a golden needle should be recalled.
[13851] Fourth, the Spontaneous Presence jewel-Appearance has six:
[13852] The mode of Spontaneous Presence arising, the mode of recollection arising,
[13853] The mode of clairvoyance arising,
[13854] The mode of obtaining dhāraṇī,
[13855] The mode of samādhi arising,
[13856] The mode of Spontaneous Presence dissolving.
[13857] First:
[13858] At the instant of wisdom dissolving into Spontaneous Presence, when those previous Appearances and one's own Awareness gather into the upper light-bridge, arising from within that,
[13859] Eight modes of arising Appearance:
[13860] Arising like Compassion, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa not severed;
[13861] Arising like light, all Appearances inwardly clear;
[13862] Arising like Kāya, awareness not lost to knowables;
[13863] Arising like Wisdom, all Appearances wide-open;
[13864] Arising like non-duality, one's own Awareness abiding one-pointedly;
[13865] Arising like liberation from extremes, not abiding in any extreme;
[13866] Arising like the impure door of saṃsāra, source of existence not ceased;
[13867] Arising like the pure door of Wisdom, Dharmatā parent-child connection.
[13868] These Appearances also appear above and below:
[13869] Above, Primordial Purity Appearance like sky free of clouds,
[13870] Below that, Sambhogakāya wrathful maṇḍala, vast and majestic,
[13871] Below that, Sambhogakāya peaceful Appearance, well-arranged in clear light,
[13872] At the sides and corners, natural Nirmāṇakāya pure-lands, pleasing to behold,
[13873] Below, the six migrations' deluded Appearance with taming Teacher,
[13874] All those also appear like self-appearance reflections,
[13875] Not recognizing essence, appearing as other.
[13876] These also arise from that previous ground-Appearance appearing at this time.
[13877] <tantra> From the Jewel Mound:
[13878] "From the mode of arising like Compassion..."</tantra>
[13879] As previously explained.
[13880] At this time, like the arrow of immeasurable compassion shot outward, gone without obstruction, not returning,


### PAGE 328

[13881] Instantly wide-openly realizing inner Dhātu,
[13882] The instruction not returning to the body should be recalled.
[13883] <tantra> From the Sun Moon Union:
[13884] "Then one's own awareness dissolving into the upper light,
[13885] Experiencing the eight modes of arising."</tantra>
[13886] At that time, the lower Sambhogakāya wrathful Appearances will also be seen.
[13887] What are the eight modes of arising?
[13888] Arising like Compassion, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa not severed;
[13889] Arising like light, all Appearances inwardly clear;
[13890] Arising like Kāya, the face of knowables not lost;
[13891] Arising like Wisdom, all Appearances wide-open;
[13892] Arising like non-duality, one's own awareness abiding one-pointedly;
[13893] Arising like liberation from extremes, not abiding in any extreme;
[13894] Arising like the impure door of saṃsāra, source of existence not ceased;
[13895] Arising like the pure door of Wisdom, Dharmatā parent-child connection.
[13896] At that time, the supreme method like the arrow of immeasurable compassion not returning should be recalled.
[13897] At this time, at that very time of Awareness having instantly dissolved into Spontaneous Presence, thereafter not returning, having gone to the jewel-king's palace,
[13898] Not exiting the gate—this is the crucial essential instruction.
[13899] That also, now recognizing the clear light Appearance, together with thigle and self-radiant state, not returning to ordinary from that, Direct Crossing familiar at that very time strikes emptiness.
[13900] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[13901] "Moreover, the Dharmatā of Awareness explained,
[13902] Seeing the linked chain as such,
[13903] Discursive recollection of thought-movement ceases.
[13904] Like birds flying in space,
[13905] In Dharmadhātu there is no going.
[13906] Without other, pure Awareness-appearance,
[13907] The cause-conditions of deluded appearance exhausted."</tantra>
[13908] 
[13909] In the intermediate state, having ripened the previous linked chain thigle into Kāya, the essential point of the linked chain not directly appearing—this is that.
[13910] Second, the mode of recollection arising:
[13911] Earlier, through the Guru's Compassion and one's own special accumulation, entering the holy Dharma, training familiarity arising here,


### PAGE 329

[13912] Having obtained empowerment, seeing the river of empowerment flow, and
[13913] Having meditated generation stage, recollecting the deity, and
[13914] Having meditated completion stage, the path, and
[13915] Instruction, and
[13916] Samādhi, and
[13917] Recollecting view,
[13918] Recollecting pure aspiration, the faculties released, recollecting natural Nirmāṇakāya, bestowing breath—
[13919] At this occasion of Spontaneous Presence, through special merit known from before, self-appearance arising is
[13920] Empowerment-ground.
[13921] First, all Tathāgatas bestow empowerment from the space above, offering goddesses immeasurable rain flowers,
[13922] Great Appearance of auspicious song and dance arising.
[13923] At this time, for those with supreme devotion to one's own Guru, the Guru recalled, immediately present in space,
[13924] Instruction introduction arising—without this, no liberation possible.
[13925] For those devoted to Yidam, seeing the deity's face, karmic body not appearing,
[13926] When holding the yidam deity's illusory body,
[13927] Prophecy also arises.
[13928] These two recollections gathered as one:
[13929] Because the supreme deity is the Guru.
[13930] <tantra> From the Wheel of Complete Enjoyment:
[13931] "Guru, great Vajra-holder,
[13932] Supreme deity, please consider me."</tantra>
[13933] 
[13934] Through the power of introduction on the five paths, recollecting that itself,
[13935] Empowering the intermediate Dharmatā Kāya, Wisdom, light, color, and so forth, and
[13936] Recollecting birth-Realm, releasing breath, faculties into natural Nirmāṇakāya's pure-land at this time, born there,
[13937] Recollecting samādhi, naturally abiding in natural samādhi for five days, and
[13938] Recollecting Guru's instruction, knowing self-appearance, engaging Dharmatā, and
[13939] Recollecting view, previously seeing Dharmatā direct view,
[13940] Now recognizing without doubt, like meeting a previously known person,


### PAGE 330

[13941] That also, through transforming previous deluded appearance immediate appearance into direct perception,
[13942] Delusion becoming clear light, without grasping-grasped Awareness inwardly clear, seeing Dharmatā with the eye without thought,
[13943] Carrying to the Ground of Primordial Purity without view-meditation, all appearance-grasping exhausted—this arises from that intention.
[13944] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[13945] "Moreover, Dharmatā Appearance explained,
[13946] Impure is delusion,
[13947] Sense doors not fabricated,
[13948] Resting evenly—this is the essential point.
[13949] Transforming from that is the secret instruction.
[13950] In appearance without grasping,
[13951] Mind without grasping arises.
[13952] Seeing with eye without investigation,
[13953] Drawing from the path of Dharmatā nonexistence,
[13954] Carrying to the Ground without view-meditation,
[13955] Actionless, effortless, result condensed,
[13956] In this, appearance-extreme does not abide."</tantra>
[13957] 
[13958] At this time, six recollections,
[13959] Six clairvoyances,
[13960] Unforgetting form,
[13961] Continuous samādhi—the fourteen are shown as empowered by self-recognition.
[13962] These recollections, though spoken after clairvoyance in the tantra,
[13963] Here, joining with the sequence of arising in the tantra, previously explained.
[13964] <tantra> From the Sun Moon Union Great Commentary, Jewel Golden Garland:
[13965] "Recollection arising later, through the power of previous special karma, these arise before those clairvoyances."</tantra>
[13966] Definitive scriptural authority for recollection:
[13967] <tantra> From the Sun Moon Union:
[13968] "At that time, six recollections also arise:
[13969] Recollecting deity, thereby seeing Yidam deity's face;
[13970] Recollecting paths, thereby empowering the intermediate Dharmatā;
[13971] Recollecting birth-Realm, thereby releasing faculties into natural Nirmāṇakāya's pure-land;
[13972] Recollecting samādhi, thereby abiding in samādhi for five days;
[13973] Recollecting Guru's instruction, thereby engaging self-appearance as non-dual;"</tantra>


### PAGE 331

[13974] <tantra> "Recollecting view, like recognizing a previously known person upon meeting again."</tantra>
[13975] Third, the mode of clairvoyance arising has six:
[13976] Faculties' clairvoyance,
[13977] Mentally serviceable clairvoyance,
[13978] Prajñā-mastered clairvoyance,
[13979] Pure seeing of wisdom clairvoyance,
[13980] Dharmatā unerring seeing clairvoyance,
[13981] Buddha's knowledge unerring seeing clairvoyance.
[13982] Those also, divided by portions: each six, thirty-six.
[13983] First, the six faculties' clairvoyance: first, eye clairvoyance arising,
[13984] From bubble-eye purity,
[13985] Without closing half-opened eyes, seeing phenomena wide-openly, and
[13986] From flesh-eye purity, seeing coarse hidden phenomena five leagues and less,
[13987] From flesh-eye purity, seeing one four-continent world with Sumeru,
[13988] From extremely pure, seeing two and three,
[13989] From extremely thoroughly pure, seeing up to ten thousand and hundred thousand,
[13990] From supremely thoroughly pure, seeing ten million and countless unerringly.
[13991] Then, from wisdom eye, seeing Nirmāṇakāya pure-lands one hundred simultaneously,
[13992] From pure, seeing eight hundred thousand Nirmāṇakāya lands,
[13993] From extremely pure, seeing one hundred thousand Nirmāṇakāya lands,
[13994] From extremely thoroughly pure, seeing nine ten millions,
[13995] From supremely thoroughly pure, seeing ninety-one.
[13996] Then, from all-knowing eye, seeing Sambhogakāya pure-lands one hundred simultaneously,
[13997] From pure, seeing five hundred thousand,
[13998] From extremely pure, seeing fifty ten millions,
[13999] From thoroughly pure, seeing seventy countless simultaneously.
[14000] Then, from mode-of-all-knowing eye, seeing Dharmakāya pure-lands inconceivable simultaneously,


### PAGE 332

[14001] From pure, seeing Sambhogakāya pure-lands inconceivable simultaneously,
[14002] From extremely pure, seeing Nirmāṇakāya pure-lands inconceivable simultaneously,
[14003] From thoroughly pure, seeing the endless Three Kāyas play pure-lands simultaneously.
[14004] Then, ear clairvoyance:
[14005] From divine ear, hearing actually resounding sounds, and hearing sounds of hidden beings beyond that,
[14006] From pure, hearing up to one thousand leagues,
[14007] From extremely pure, five thousand,
[14008] From thoroughly pure, two hundred thousand,
[14009] From flesh ear, hearing lower realm sounds up to one hundred thousand leagues,
[14010] From pure, hearing asura sounds,
[14011] From extremely pure, hearing god sounds,
[14012] From thoroughly pure, hearing simultaneously sounds of beings in inconceivable worlds.
[14013] From liberated ear, hearing śrāvaka and
[14014] Pratyekabuddha sounds, and
[14015] From pure, hearing bodhisattva messenger sounds, and
[14016] From extremely pure, hearing countless Buddhas' Speech, and
[14017] From thoroughly pure, hearing the dialogue of seven countless Buddhas.
[14018] Countless is the name of the number at the end of sixty other number-places.
[14019] Then, nose clairvoyance: from divine nose, smelling invisible scents, and
[14020] From pure, smelling insentient phenomena scents, and
[14021] From extremely pure, smelling formless phenomena scents,
[14022] From thoroughly pure, smelling space-dwelling scents.
[14023] From nose possessing marks, smelling simultaneously six-realm beings' scents, and
[14024] From pure, smelling śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha scents, and
[14025] From extremely pure, smelling bodhisattva scents, and
[14026] From thoroughly pure, smelling perfectly complete Buddhas' scents.
[14027] Tongue clairvoyance: from element tongue purity, tasting divine nectar flavor.
[14028] From pure, tasting seven thousand nectar flavors,


### PAGE 333

[14029] From extremely pure, tasting actual great nectar of ḍākinīs,
[14030] From thoroughly pure, obtaining the hero with nectar-swirling mouth.
[14031] From pure-upholder tongue, tasting samādhi of great arrangement flavor,
[14032] From extremely pure, tasting nectar of five thousand Buddhas' blessings,
[14033] From thoroughly pure, tasting nectar of seven ten-kalpa Buddhas' blessings.
[14034] Body clairvoyance: with subtle dust-end body, touching with gentle melody,
[14035] From pure, touching Maitreya stainless Kāya,
[14036] From extremely pure, equally touching heart ornamented by thousand suns,
[14037] From thoroughly pure, touching Samantabhadra infinite heart maṇḍala.
[14038] With exhaustion-of-stains body, touching past Buddhas' hearts,
[14039] From pure, present, and
[14040] From extremely pure, future, and
[14041] From thoroughly pure, touching three-times-as-one Buddhas' hearts.
[14042] Mind clairvoyance:
[14043] With ordinary self-pure mind, mastering ten samādhis,
[14044] From pure, mastering one hundred,
[14045] From extremely pure, mastering one thousand,
[14046] From thoroughly pure, mastering ten thousand.
[14047] With mind liberated from form-limit, able to transform individually four elements' potency,
[14048] From pure, able to move beings' harmonious abodes,
[14049] From extremely pure, able to transform six migrations' abodes mutually,
[14050] From thoroughly pure, able to seize śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha miracle-power.
[14051] Thus, faculties: eye,
[14052] Ear,
[14053] Nose,
[14054] Tongue,
[14055] Body,
[14056] Mind—the six,
[14057] Successively: eye six,
[14058] Ear three,
[14059] Remaining four each two, seventeen,
[14060] Calculated four-by-four: sixty-eight are faculties' clairvoyance,
[14061] Comprised within six categories.
[14062] Second, six mentally serviceable clairvoyances:


### PAGE 334

[14063] From mind's pure seeing of previous attachment purified, and
[14064] From seeing future arising delusion exhausted, and
[14065] From complete knowledge of trainees' seeing, and
[14066] From seeing non-seeing becoming path, and
[14067] From seeing all beings perfectly complete, and
[14068] From mind's pure seeing liberated from faculties' inversion.
[14069] That also, if thinking here that without body-mind, faculties' and mind's clairvoyance arising is unreasonable,
[14070] The obscurations of body-mind clairvoyance purified at this time by power of appearing—thus spoken.
[14071] As the five afflictions abiding become Wisdom.
[14072] From afflictions purified, wisdom self-clear,
[14073] Afflictions themselves becoming Wisdom is impossible,
[14074] Because virtue and non-virtue as cause-result absolutely impossible.
[14075] However, as merely labeled thus, here also should be known.
[14076] If prajñā exists, there is one crucial essential point here.
[14077] First, from mind's pure seeing previous attachment purified, recollecting previous lives one hundred thousand, and
[14078] From pure, recollecting one thousand simultaneously, and
[14079] From extremely pure, recollecting one hundred thousand, and
[14080] From thoroughly pure, recollecting seventy-two ten-million lives simultaneously, like fresh bilva fruit in the palm.
[14081] From seeing future arising delusion exhausted pure seeing,
[14082] Knowing previous lives' body characteristics, and
[14083] From pure, speech, and
[14084] From extremely pure, mind, and
[14085] From thoroughly pure, seeing body-speech-mind three characteristics simultaneously.
[14086] From mind's seeing complete knowledge of trainees,
[14087] Seeing other beings' body characteristics of countless ten-million lives, and
[14088] From pure, speech, and
[14089] From extremely pure, mind, and
[14090] From thoroughly pure, seeing three characteristics simultaneously.
[14091] From mind's seeing non-seeing becoming path,

[14092] Knowing the number of three-thousandfold great world-system's subtle dust in an instant, and
[14093] From pure, knowing the number of how those beings' minds moved in that many abodes simultaneously, and
[14094] From extremely pure, knowing vessel-contents' natures, and
[14095] From thoroughly pure, seeing Dharmatā emptiness meanings.
[14096] From mind's seeing all beings perfectly complete, seeing in an instant how much wind moved when one's previous body was taken, and
[14097] From pure, seeing simultaneously the number of non-virtuous minds moved at that time, and
[14098] From extremely pure, seeing simultaneously the number of virtuous, and
[14099] From thoroughly pure, seeing simultaneously the number of both virtuous and non-virtuous.
[14100] From mind's seeing liberated from faculties' inversion,
[14101] Seeing previous abodes' characteristics of however many lives one previously took, and
[14102] From pure, seeing others' previous birth-abodes, and
[14103] From extremely pure, knowing body-speech-mind conduct at those times, and
[14104] From thoroughly pure, knowing simultaneously characteristics of both previous birth-abodes and what conduct the three doors performed.
[14105] Thus, six mind clairvoyances divided four-by-four: twenty-four.
[14106] Third, six prajñā-mastered clairvoyances:
[14107] Seeing of prajñā free from conception, and
[14108] Free from word,
[14109] Free from thought,
[14110] Free from investigation,
[14111] Seeing of prajñā investigating characteristics, and
[14112] Clairvoyance of seeing of prajñā free from characteristics.
[14113] That also, free from conception, seeing one's own mind's characteristics instantly, and
[14114] From pure, and from extremely pure, both self and other, and
[14115] From thoroughly pure, seeing all remainder without remainder.
[14116] From prajñā's seeing free from word, seeing words of basket teachings' phenomena simultaneously, and
[14117] From pure, knowing those meanings unerring and erroneous, and
[14118] From extremely pure, knowing those results and liberation-abodes, and
[14119] From thoroughly pure, seeing those individual entries.
[14120] Basket teachings' meaning unerring, uncommon secret, and
[14121] Erroneous, common view-conduct investigations.
[14122] From prajñā's seeing free from thought, knowing all phenomena's nature, and
[14123] From pure, seeing practitioners' sharp-dull faculties, and
[14124] From extremely pure, knowing faculties' liberation-abodes, and
[14125] From thoroughly pure, knowing faculties' concordant phenomena.
[14126] From prajñā's seeing transcending investigation, all general meanings higher seeing, and
[14127] From pure, seeing one's own meaning, and
[14128] From extremely pure, seeing both general and individual characteristics higher, and
[14129] From thoroughly pure, seeing meaning transcending word and letter.
[14130] From prajñā's seeing cutting becoming, seeing saṃsāra phenomena's causes, and
[14131] From pure, seeing those conditions' afflictions' characteristics, and
[14132] From extremely pure, seeing those times and characteristics, and
[14133] From thoroughly pure, seeing liberation from those.
[14134] From prajñā's seeing free from characteristics, grasping one's own mind's movement measure, and
[14135] From pure, seeing directly seeing mind's characteristics there, and
[14136] From extremely pure, seeing other beings' minds' movements, and
[14137] From thoroughly pure, knowing simultaneously other beings' minds' movements of three times,
[14138] Conceptual,
[14139] Nonconceptual,
[14140] Thought distinctions.
[14141] Thus, six prajñā clairvoyances divided four-by-four: twenty-four.
[14142] Fourth, six pure seeing of wisdom clairvoyances:


### PAGE 337

[14143] From clairvoyance of Dharmadhātu wisdom manifesting, knowing future beings' birth-abodes simultaneously,
[14144] From mirror-like, knowing past,
[14145] From equality, knowing present,
[14146] From discriminating, knowing future beings' transmigration,
[14147] From accomplishing activity, knowing past,
[14148] From non-abiding wisdom pure seeing clairvoyance, knowing present beings' transmigration.
[14149] Fifth, six Dharmatā unerring seeing clairvoyances: when these arise, perfecting self-benefit, engaging in other-benefit activity.
[14150] From clairvoyance realizing all phenomena free from elaboration, seeing hell birth-abodes simultaneously, and there emanating countless ten-million manifestations,
[14151] From realizing signless Dharmatā, seeing hungry ghost birth-abodes and life-span and
[14152] Suffering and
[14153] Karma and karmic end, compassion arising, emanating countless three,
[14154] From realizing all phenomena as clear light nature, seeing animal birth-abodes and
[14155] Suffering and
[14156] Life-span and
[14157] Karma and karmic ends, compassion arising, emanating five countless,
[14158] From realizing all phenomena as equality, seeing human birth-abodes and so forth, compassion arising, emanating one hundred hundred ten millions,
[14159] From realizing all phenomena empty of self or by self, seeing asura birth-abodes and characteristics, emanating ninety thousand and nine thousand,
[14160] From realizing all phenomena free from word, knowing gods' birth-abodes and life-span and falling time,
[14161] Therein emanating nine thousand nine hundred.
[14162] Thus, other-benefit knowledge self-arising, different types of beings:
[14163] Twenty-one hells, and


### PAGE 338

[14164] Four hungry ghosts, and
[14165] Two animals, and
[14166] Four humans, and
[14167] Three asuras, and
[14168] Gods with many distinctions, gathered in three realms,
[14169] Gods and six birth-abodes, and
[14170] Form, and
[14171] Enjoyment, and
[14172] Conduct, and
[14173] Perception, and
[14174] Characteristics.
[14175] Those six clairvoyances see and know faculties and powers.
[14176] Thus, thirty with-outflow faculties' clairvoyance seeing modes, and
[14177] Six faculties seeing other shore and so forth, are without-outflow.
[14178] Here, depending on object, with-outflow and without-outflow are spoken thus.
[14179] Object-phenomena deluded appearance with-outflow, and
[14180] Dharmatā free from elaboration non-deluded without-outflow—meeting mind is spoken thus,
[14181] And naturally realizing mind, noble wisdom equal without-outflow, and
[14182] Ordinary beings' with-outflow should be known.
[14183] Sixth, six Buddha-knowledge wisdom extremely without-outflow unerring clairvoyances:
[14184] Thus, completing thirty,
[14185] Abiding samādhi expanded, seeing phenomena's mode unerring, abiding,
[14186] Essence Kāya expanded, seeing Appearances comprised of Three Kāyas,
[14187] Knowledge wisdom expanded, seeing those previous clairvoyances simultaneously,
[14188] Activity enlightened activity expanded, seeing thirty-six signs completing Nirmāṇakāya activity as thirty-six clairvoyances simultaneously,
[14189] Thus expanded, engaging in Dharmatā unceasing wisdom clairvoyance, seeing phenomena's appearance hidden extent,
[14190] Self-liberated sign wisdom natural abiding clairvoyance emptiness Appearance, and
[14191] Non-seeing faculties, and
[14192] Knowing, and
[14193] Mind, and
[14194] Prajñā, and
[14195] Wisdom, and
[14196] From Compassion aspect,
[14197] Hidden Three Kāyas self-continuum attachment bound, and


### PAGE 339

[14198] Previously knowing-all obscurations bound, all knowing—therefore great clairvoyance.
[14199] Thus, in the first of six clairvoyances: sixty-eight.
