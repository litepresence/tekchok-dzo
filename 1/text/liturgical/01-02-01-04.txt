[998] Third: the gods perpetually intoxicated by honey wine. These celestial beings inhabit the third tier of the Thal-ba fields, realms of intoxicating fragrance and divine ambrosia situated in the space above the great snow-mountain Meru. Known as 'Thal-ba, Intoxicated by Fragrance,' these gods continuously experience bliss through the nectar of celestial honey-wine, a divine elixir that arises spontaneously from the wish-fulfilling trees of their realm.

<tantra>As the Supreme Tantra proclaims: 'Above the world of Jambudvīpa, in the third celestial tier, dwell the gods intoxicated by divine fragrance. Their minds are filled with bliss, their bodies radiant with light, and they know no suffering, no anxiety, no fear.'</tantra>

<list>
• The honey-wine that flows from the jewel-trees, golden in color and sweet beyond compare
• The nectar of immortal gods, granting sustained bliss and freedom from aging
• The fragrant waters of sandalwood, sprinkling the golden grounds of their realm
• The celestial intoxication that liberates the mind into states of samadhi and joy
</list>

These gods experience continuous intoxication not of delusion but of divine bliss. The honey-wine they consume does not cloud their awareness but rather heightens their perception of the beauty surrounding them. Their intoxication is a spiritual intoxication, a rapture born of meritorious karma accumulated through countless eons of virtuous conduct.

<tantra>The Tantra of the Perfection states: 'In the Thal-ba fields, the gods who drink the honey-wine of the desire realm experience bliss that transcends the pleasures of Jambudvīpa a hundred thousand fold. Yet this bliss, though great, remains impermanent, for even these exalted gods will one day exhaust their merit and fall to lower states.'</tantra>

The realm of these intoxicated gods is adorned with palaces of gold and jewel, surrounded by pleasure-groves where wish-fulfilling trees continuously produce the nectar of immortal gods. The ground is formed of precious substances, sprinkled with sandalwood water, and covered by divine flowers rising to the knee-level of the celestial inhabitants.

Sun and moon, planets and stars, circle above their realm, each possessing their own divine cities and measureless palaces. The sun's palace, fifty-one leagues in extent, formed from fire-crystal, provides light and warmth. The moon, fifty leagues, self-arisen from water-crystal, cools their intoxication with gentle radiance.

These gods, though intoxicated, are not heedless. Their intoxication is the intoxication of dharma, the rapture of merit, the bliss of positive karma ripening into its result. They dwell in the Thal-ba fields, above the four continents, floating in the sky of forty-thousand leagues, radiating as light-rays throughout the Sahā World.

Thus, the third tier of the Thal-ba fields: the gods perpetually intoxicated by honey wine, dwelling in realms of celestial bliss, surrounded by the splendor of the six desire-god heavens, their existence a testament to the power of accumulated merit and virtuous action.
