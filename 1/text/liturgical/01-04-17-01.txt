[3870] The first:
[3871] At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis,
[3872] Even the mere word of elaboration is not established,
[3873] The elaboration of designation does not exist,
[3874] In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said.
[3875] Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted,
[3876] The ultimate meaning of cessation.
[3877] The second:
[3878] From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur,
[3879] At the time of the three käyas appearing on the path,
[3880] Whatever is not liberated does not exist,
[3881] At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.
[3882] The essence of symbolic instruction: non-deluded, thought-free.



[3883] Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping.
[3884] Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.
[3885] When divided, there are two:
[3886] The oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness,
[3887] The oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.
