[4848] FIRST, GROUNDED BY FIVE TYPES, IS EXPLAINED:
[4849] From the Sun-Moon-Joined Tantra:
[4850] By root meaning: name-identity grasped.
[4851] By yoga meaning: conclusion gate shown.
[4852] By purpose meaning: one's place established,
[4853] By word meaning, the straight line is connected.
[4854] By history meaning, the minds are satisfied.
[4855] Thus it is spoken.
[4856] Thus, when not explained, the defects are:
[4857] From that itself: || 10 ||
[4858] If history meaning is not explained,
[4859] Toward this Secret Great Definite Teaching,
[4860] The defect of mind-not-believing arises.
[4861] If root meaning is not explained,
[4862] Dharmas are not gathered into rigpa—
[4863] The defect of limitless arises.

[4951] Thus explained and heard,
[4952]
[4953] Vajra-holder,
[4954] Vajrasattva visualized:
[4955] Dharma light-rays pervading sky, emanated—

[4957] Ignorance's sleep is awakened, || 110 ||
[4958] Wisdom's meaning obtained,

[4971] For sentient beings and teachings to abide long: dedication:
[4972] May the Buddha's teachings flourish and spread!
[4973] May all sentient beings be blissful and happy!
[4974] May they practice dharma day and night!
[4975] May self and other benefit arise spontaneously!
[4976] Thus to be spoken.
[4977] THIRD TOPIC: ARISEN-BASIS LETTERS' SOUND AND MEANING EXPLAINED—two: || 130 ||
[4978] Letter-cloud's nature generally shown, and
[4979] Abode-definite specifically explained.
[4980] First has four:
[4981] 1. Abode-nature-meaning's letter
[4982] 2. Body-abode-channel's letter
[4983] 3. Expression-sound's letter
[4984] 4. Result's ultimate letter
[4985] First:
[4986] Mind-nature, naturally clear light, self-arisen wisdom—transcending eternalism and nihilism, coming and going—is the nature.
[4987] Called "letter of sphere-ultimate reality," || 140 ||
[4988] From the Secret Essence of Magical Display:
[4989] Mind-nature is letter's nature—
[4990] Letter: wish-fulfilling jewel cloud.
[4991] Thus.
[4992] Second:
[4993] In the body's four channel-wheels' center, within the three heart-channels existing as three pillars—
[4994] OM AH HUM: these self-arisen letters three, colors white-red-blue three, abiding—
[4995] OUTER: body, speech, mind—three.
[4996] INNER: afflictions, poisons—three.
[4997] SECRET: body, speech, mind—three's support. || 150 ||
[4998] With light-rays five's radiance existing:
[4999] In wheels four's channel-petals: father, mother, method, wisdom's letters: vowel letters sixteen and
[5000] Consonants—
[5001] Thirty-four:
[5002] Singles,
[5003] Doubles,
[5004] Prefixes,
[5005] Through branch divisions: all eighty-four thousand abiding.
[5006] OUTER: body's aggregates, elements, sense-fields' support.
[5007] Cause of speech and expression arising. || 160 ||
[5008] INNER: afflictions, thought-collections, eighty-four thousand's support.
[5009] Day and night, conceptions many arisen, support doing.
[5010] Secret: when pure, dharma's gates that many arising, support doing.
[5011] That also: each consonant with vowel letters sixteen's sound nearby abiding.
[5012] Letter's form also that's sound whatever arisen, stacked—for example:
[5013] KA KĀ—
[5014] Within, life A existing: called A Ā.
[5015] From Symbolic Expression:
[5016] A is all letters' supreme—
[5017] Within, arisen, birthless. || 170 ||
[5018] Thus:
[5019] KI KĪ is Ī.
[5020] KU KŪ is Ū.
[5021] KE KAI is E AI.
[5022] KO KAU is O AU.
[5023] KRA KRA is RA RA.
[5024] RI RĪ and LI LĪ: life A existing, KI KĪ gathered—
[5025] AṂ AḤ is KAṂ KAḤ called.
[5026] Those root letters: double-stacked KKA said is great.
[5027] GHA JHA DHA BHA: said like thick. || 180 ||
[5028] Triple-stacked and five-stacked, etc.:
[5029] Called "sphere's single letter."
[5030] Suitable ones read as one.
[5031] Unsuitable ones read separately.
[5032] Channels in thus existing: body, speech, mind, wisdom five, etc., in different spheres.
[5033] Letters and similar: light five's appearance having—just brush-strokes, essence white-red, in wind's center, self-clear existing.
[5034] Now: the clear root letters—
[5035] Memory clear, wisdom great—
[5036] Sense-fields clear and unclear: those reverse.
[5037] Youth: root letters clear, mind sharp, sense-fields clear. || 190 ||
[5038] Old age: root letters unclear, diminished.
[5039] THIRD: SOUND'S LETTER is:
[5040] Speech—speaking ones.
[5041] Cause: root letters, wind-moved, arise.
[5042] Condition: tongue and palate's action, arise.
[5043] That also: within, A-like arises,
[5044] Throat: KA etc. arise,
[5045] Tongue-tip: TA THA etc. arise,
[5046] Tongue-tip and palate two meet: crown arises—called so.
[5047] RA LA-like: tongue and palate strongly joined: ṬA ṬHA arise. || 200 ||
[5048] Lips: PA PHA BA BHA MA said like—
[5049] These sounds: whatever expressed, arise depending on those places.
[5050] FOURTH: ULTIMATE RESULT'S LETTER is:
[5051] Buddha's speech, sixty vowels, appear—
[5052] From enjoyment-body's channels, abodes, pure letters.
[5053] Letters emanated: in sky, dharma-sounds famous.
[5054] Letters emanated: Buddha's body etc. become, sentient beings' benefit performing.
[5055] Enjoyment-body and emanation-body's root letters: wisdom five's appearance adorned.
[5056] This existing: depending, Buddha-time, sūtras and tantras enumerate measureless sentient beings appear.
[5057] Emanation: sentient beings' benefit arising. || 210 ||
[5058] SECOND: ABODES DEFINITE, SPECIFICALLY EXPLAINED—five:
[5059] 1. Root letters briefly shown
[5060] 2. Branch prefixes extensively divided
[5061] 3. Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa explained, manner definite

[5074] Those meanings joined, definite:
[5075] FROM RIGPA RANGSHAR:
[5076] A HO, nearby retinue, listen!
[5077] I explain well—hold in mind. || 230 ||
[5078] Buddhas all's intention is:
[5079] Words and letters not existing—
[5080] Words and letters appear like.
[5081] Yet words' meaning greatly liberates.
[5082] That also gathered in letters' syllables.
[5083] Those meanings explained thus:

[5147] All thus to be known. || 300 ||
[5148] Thus it is spoken.
[5149] SECOND: BRANCH PREFIXES, EXPLAINED, DIVIDED—two:
[5150] ROOT PREFIX EXPLANATION,
[5151] BRANCH PREFIX EXPLANATION.
[5152] FIRST:
[5153] Root letters thirty-four's context made,
[5154] NYA and WA two breaths—one made here.
[5155] Prefix NYA and single WA arranged,
[5156] These long A and
[5157] Not-uniform double-stacked. || 310 ||
[5158] Single appearing, breath great within—meaning double-stacked abiding.
[5159] Separately arranged thus:
[5160] A KṢA KHA GHA DHA
[5161] CCA CHA JA JHA ÑĀ
[5162] ṬṬĀ ṬHĀ ḌṆA ḌHA ÑĀ
[5163] TA THA DA DHA NĀ
[5164] PĀ A PHA KHA BHA BHA MĀ A
[5165] YĀ ṢĀ RA LA MĀ ṢA BHA ṢA HA MĀ
[5166] KṢAḤ: these prefixes with reality joined:
[5167] Appearance-emptiness, || 320 ||
[5168] Method-wisdom,
[5169] Father-mother,
[5170] Sphere-wisdom—
[5171] Pure and spontaneous individually joined explained existing.
[5172] FROM RANGSHAR:
[5173] Thus letters' meanings joined,
[5174] Reality-basis thus applied.
[5175] That prefix's power explained.
[5176] Thus it is spoken.
[5177] SECOND: || 330 ||
[5178] Root letters those to:
[5179] NA RO,
[5180] GU GU,
[5181] DRENG BU,
[5182] YA-tagged,
[5183] RA-tagged—five tagged:
[5184] Awareness, wisdom five's self-light etc. shown—
[5185] Manner thus.
[5186]
[5187] These letter types—please examine carefully. || 340 ||
[5188] Stacked letters 1.
[5189] Note:
[5190] These letters' nature double-stacked is prefix, root prefix.
[5191] NA RO etc. are called "branch."
[5192] "Prefix of prefix" called.
[5193] Explanation manner: roots earlier syllable-joined, explained.
[5194] Letters RA and LA: two, CA-tag not,
[5195] Others all obtained—explained.
[5196] Also from Rangshar:
[5197] All branches thus are. || 350 ||
[5198] Explanation manner this like:
[5199] Prefix and branch connection—
[5200] Explanation manner prefix explains.
[5201] Letter's syllable meaning applies.
[5202] Letter's explanation manner: sound-like explained.
[5203] Letter RA: CA not.
[5204] Letter's example, symbol meaning joined—
[5205] Thus all abiding.
[5206] Thus it is spoken.
[5207] THIRD: SAṂSĀRA-NIRVĀṆA'S EXPLANATION MANNER, DEFINITE—two: || 360 ||
[5208] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's explanation manner.
[5209] First:
[5210] Tantra's occasion, prefixless letters: saṃsāra's dharmas, own awareness arise—explained.
[5211] That also: KA-like, saṃsāra's primordial sphere, deluded, established,
[5212] Ignorance etc., kleśas' collections, with—called, etc.—explained.
[5213] Prefix and branch: whatever arisen, nirvāṇa—explained.
[5214] That also: prefix arisen, appearance-emptiness etc., dual explained,
[5215] Branch arisen: kāyas five etc., five-group, three-group, six-group etc., branch's number suitable—explained.
[5216] Also from Rangshar:
[5217] There, letters all's || 370 ||
[5218] Explanation manner types two gathered:
[5219] Nirvāṇa-letter explanation manner and
[5220] Saṃsāra's letters explanation manner.
[5221] Nirvāṇa's letters:
[5222] Prefix and branch—explained.
[5223] Impure saṃsāra's letters:
[5224] First MA—explained.
[5225] Thus explanation manner types two by,
[5226] Letters all's meanings liberated.
[5227] Thus it is spoken. || 380 ||
[5228] FOURTH: LETTERS' ABODE AND ENJOYMENT EXPLAINED:
[5229] Prefix and branch all-complete time:
[5230] Explained now the not-circulating portion of the first root-letter's mother.
[5231] That prefix which has arisen up to that point is the abodes beyond nirvāṇa.
[5232] When expressing, that vowel should be joined to that prefix and recited together.
[5233] The nature of letters and the prefix branches are the abodes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[5234] The prefixes and branches also arise as the enjoyment of the consort letters.
[5235] There the consort's above existing prefix's letters are the GU GU light letters:
[5236] GRENG BU, the path.
[5237] NA RO, the sphere. || 390 ||
[5238] KLAD KOR, the dharmatā letters.
[5239] Thus the four existing above are called the lamp letters.
[5240] The four lamps arise from the eyes in the upper head of the body, like [images] in a mirror.
[5241] The prefix below is the basis letter.
[5242] The YA-tagged is the pervading letter.
[5243] The RA-tagged is the arising letter.
[5244] The foot-hook is the compassion letter.
[5245] These also arise from self-arisen [wisdom].
[5246] The abode and enjoyment of letters should be known thus for all.
[5247] There the prefixes and branches: GU GU light letter explained. || 400 ||
[5248] GRENG BU path letter explained.
[5249] NA RO sphere letter explained.
[5250] KLAD KOR dharmatā letter explained.
[5251] Those four above letters are the lamp letters as accepted.
[5252] Foot-hook compassion letter explained.
[5253] YA-tagged pervading letter explained.
[5254] RA-tagged arising letter explained.
[5255] There the prefix which has arisen is explained joined to the prefix. Thus it is spoken.
[5256] These letters in such collections are symbols.
[5257] Like when many threads are tied to many fingers of someone's many messages. || 410 ||
[5258] The meaning indicates the basis of dharmas, path and result, sphere, wisdom, and so forth of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[5259] The fifth shows two expression manners of those.
[5260] The abode and expression manner are shown generally,
[5261] And the near-sound expression is explained in particular.
[5262] The first two: the common abode's arrangement and...
[5263]
[5264]
[5265]
[5266]
[5267] || 420 ||
[5268]
[5269] Now explained the sequence of long and short, heavy and light.
[5270] The first is this:
[5271] In whatever tantra, however letters of mantra may appear, whether stacked or single,
[5272] The inverted letters are placed wherever appropriate at the root,
[5273] And whatever prefix has arisen, the inverted [letter] is joined to the palate at the tip of the tongue, expressed directly without inversion, as it is called.
[5274] Like ṬA to TA, and so forth.
[5275] The branches are also joined appropriately to the mother [letter] and expressed.
[5276] These are read combined together as one life-force and kindred class,
[5277] Like K+KA, || 430 ||
[5278] Like K+AÜ.
[5279] Not as single [letters] but each separately expressed,
[5280] Like G+HAJA and so forth.
[5281] This also [comes] from Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5282] The letters' mantra are thus:
[5283] The inverted, the prefix, and the branches
[5284] Are all expressed here as they are,
[5285] And each is pronounced as appropriate.
[5286] The inverted [letter] is tagged and becomes manifest.
[5287] The mother herself is placed as basis. || 440 ||
[5288] The branches are nirvāṇa letters.
[5289] The prefix is only saṃsāra.
[5290] Thus mantras and letters, each is pronounced as appropriate. Thus it is spoken.
[5291] This also [comes] from Rangshar:
[5292] The non-saṃsāric is explained,
[5293] The prefix and branches are nirvāṇa's letters explained. From Rigpa Rangdrol, the mother is not placed as basis: the prefix is saṃsāra and the branches are nirvāṇa—these two explanations are not contradictory but are understood according to context.
[5294] At that time, when saṃsāra's sentient beings are pervaded by the Buddha's essence, and sentient beings are taken as basis, the letters' mother is made saṃsāric, so the prefix and branches are understood as saṃsāra.
[5295] When the nature of awareness separates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the manner of distinction and completeness, that mother is shown as awareness and placed as basis: the prefix is explained as saṃsāra and the branches are expressed as the dharmas of nirvāṇa.
[5296] In their nature they are always joined together, for they are designations without inherent existence. When impure saṃsāra is indicated, the root letter is taken as the mind of pride.
[5297] || 450 ||
[5298]
[5299]
[5300]
[5301]
[5302]
[5303]
[5304]
[5305]
[5306]
[5307] || 460 ||
[5308]
[5309] The prefix and branch above [the letter] exist as karma and afflictions, aggregates and elements, sense-fields and elements, grasping and so forth—and are also explained thus.
[5310] When pure nirvāṇa is explained, that mother letter is self-arisen wisdom, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the three kāyas, five wisdoms, five lights, and ten powers.
[5311] When saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are both explained on one basis, that mother letter is awareness itself, and the prefix and branch are explained as the dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[5312] When the basis is explained, that mother letter is awareness, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the essential nature, compassion, and the five winds.
[5313] When the path is explained, that mother letter is the basis-nature, the essence of the heart, which is the nature of the threefold compassion; and the prefix and branch are also explained as the four lamps of basis-appearance and the four appearances.
[5314] When the result is explained, that mother letter is the Buddha's mind, self-arisen wisdom and branch are also; and the prefix explained as the kāyas, wisdoms, qualities, and activities.
[5315] In brief, whatever meaning is shown, the chief one is the mother letter at that time of explanation, and its retinue—the prefix and branch—should be explained.
[5316] The second, the sequence of long-short and heavy-light, is explained as follows, from Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5317] Sound is shown in four aspects: long, short, very long, and great. Thus the basis's sound is called. || 470 ||
[5318] The short is one letter; when expressed, it is recited for the duration of one expression.
[5319] The long equals two; depending on the occasion, it may be class-concordant, or when life-force is concordant even if class-discordant, there are stacked [letters] and those having a long portion.
[5320] The great is very long, arising for approximately the duration of three.
[5321] The basis's sound is the expanse of letters, namely the mother, branch, and prefix together. Those, when life-force is concordant, are recited as one.

[5339]
[5340]
[5341]
[5342]
[5343]
[5344]
[5345] When not concordant, they are recited separately.
[5346] Also, on some occasions, the short [letters] with prefix and branch, and single [letters] without any long portion, are expressed.
[5347] The "long" refers to those having the long portion of A. || 500 ||
[5348] The "great" refers to K+KA and similar class-concordant stacked [combinations].
[5349] The basis's sound: KA with CA suffix, and so forth—these thick [letters] are renowned.
[5350] When joined with the musician, the duration of letters is counted as before; thus it should be known in Tibetan usage.
[5351] Joined with the tantra's own text, depending on purity and state, it is joined as below and explained accordingly.
[5352] The definite heavy-light and long-short of these: the thick ones are heavy, the short ones are light.
[5353] The abodes are divided individually:
[5354] From Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5355] The long and short sounds are shown as follows:
[5356] AA+A stacked—long;
[5357] KA+KA tagged—long; || 510 ||
[5358] BA+BA tagged—great;
[5359] JA+JA tagged—thick;
[5360] NYA+NYA tagged—long;
[5361] SA+SA tagged—short;
[5362] YA+YA tagged—great;
[5363] MA+MA tagged—thick;
[5364] GA+GA tagged—long;
[5365] TSA+TSA tagged—short;
[5366] HA+HA tagged—great;
[5367] THA+CA tagged—thick; || 520 ||
[5368] KHA+KHA tagged—long;
[5369] NGA+NGA tagged—short;
[5370] PA+BA tagged—great;
[5371] THA+THA tagged—thick.
[5372] These and other letters, the joined meanings of syllables should be known.
[5373] These are arranged as follows:
[5374] KA+CA tagged—thick;
[5375] THA+NA tagged—thick;
[5376] JA+BA tagged—thick;
[5377] MA+SHA tagged—thick; || 530 ||
[5378] BA+A tagged—thick;
[5379] NA+TA tagged—thick.
[5380] These are the thick [letters].
[5381] The long letters are:
[5382] YA+NGA tagged—long;
[5383] GA+HA tagged—long;
[5384] THA+DA tagged—long;
[5385] A+KHA tagged—long;
[5386] TA+NA tagged—long;
[5387] SHA+ZHA tagged—long. || 540 ||
[5388] These are the long [letters].
[5389] These are the great [letters]:
[5390] SVA+LA tagged—great;
[5391] YA+DU tagged—great;
[5392] KA+SKRE tagged—great;
[5393] HRA+HA tagged—great;
[5394] NYA+RA tagged—great;
[5395] NGA+TE tagged—great;
[5396] YA+LA tagged—great;
[5397] SMA+KHRU tagged—great. || 550 ||
[5398] These are the great letters.
[5399] The short letters are:
[5400] NGA+YA tagged—short;
[5401] GA+NGA tagged—short;
[5402] DA+NGA tagged—short;
[5403] KA+ZHA tagged—short;
[5404] JA+SA tagged—short;
[5405] YA+NI tagged—short;
[5406] KHA+U tagged—short.
[5407] || 560 ||
[5408]
[5409]
[5410]
[5411]
[5412]
[5413]
[5414] SA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NA tagged—short. The branches that arise are pronounced accordingly. Thus it is spoken.
[5415] Also CA, JA, ZA, ZHA, and CHA have arisen; one should not doubt that India does not [have them], for although Sanskrit's well-composed letters do not [exist], the ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāṇa have those sounds, so these forms have arisen.
[5416] These tantras are the letters of Uḍḍiyāṇa, held by the ḍākinīs.
[5417] The second, near-sound expression, is explained in two aspects: the single [letter] and the expression of the sphere's abode. || 570 ||
[5418] The single letter's abode is A, GA, SHA, and so forth—joined to whichever root of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa and explained. Tibetans recite GA, JA, DA, BA, and so forth, joined with aspiration. Other letters are recited separately.
[5419] Also, for KARMA, SARVA, and so forth, the prefix sound is called RA and RBA. When alone, it is called MA and BA.
[5420] The expression of the sphere's abode has three [aspects]: the prefix, the branch, and the stacked [letter].
[5421] The first is the double-stacked, called "prefix." When life-force is concordant, it is recited as one: like BHA, DHA, JHA, etc.
[5422] These, the letter's consort sound, are expressed with the ZHA-manner of HA sound slightly emanating.
[5423] When life-force is not concordant, it is separated and expressed separately: like AṬA, CAṬA, CA RI, recited as A ṬA, CA ṬA, CA RI.
[5424] All stacked types are thus.
[5425] The second also has life-concordant and life-discordant sequences, similar to that.
[5426] Separately, in Tibetan manner, like KAG CHEN: above KA-like, NA RO two, ZHENG BU two, GU GU two, KLAD KOR one, ZHABS KYU two, YA-tagged two, RA-tagged two, RI part one—when these arise, the mother [letter] arises fourteen times.
[5427] "See the classes of these letters aside." Stacked letters, note 2. || 580 ||
[5428] KO KĀO; KE KĀE; KĪ; KU; KYŪ; KRA KRĀ.

[5462]
[5463]
[5464]
[5465] KAṂ KĀ is called. The root KA is KA alone; the head-circle is KAṂ. NA RO and so forth: each subsequent [letter] is read with its long portion. That is made the power of the branch tagged to the single [letter].
[5466] For the prefix with branch tags:
[5467] "Please examine the classes of these letters carefully." Stacked letters, note 3. || 620 ||
[5468] For one KA-like: NA RO two, GU GU two, ZHENG BU two, foot-hook two, YA tag two, RA tag two—one affixing LA. If the head-circle and one long portion exist:
[5469] The root KA and the affixing LA two are given half of the above and below NA RO and so forth. Given to the head-circle LA, this is the giving condition for both long portions to benefit.
[5470] For example: KĪ LĪ KĀO LĀO KĒ LĒ KŪ LŪ KYŪ LŪ YA KRĀ LĀ RA LAṂ.
[5471] Thus, when LA and RA are life-discordant, the normal LA and RA tags are inserted in order and pronounced.
[5472] When many or few branches arise above and below, the remainder is given to the prefix letter and read.
[5473] The head-circle gives power to the prefix.
[5474] When the above NA RO and so forth consist of one without elongation, it is pronounced lengthened.
[5475] The NA RO and so forth—the four ornament letters—are given to the prefix.
[5476] When the below end-support, foot-hook, and so forth, each are not in a group, it is given to the root and the prefix is pronounced alone.
[5477] The example of these two: according to sequence, KMOṂ is called: KA MO KA MI KA ME MAṂ is read. || 630 ||
[5478] KACAR is called: KRA CA KYA CA KU CA is pronounced.
[5479] This also: the root letters are first led by the nose and pronounced before the prefix.
[5480] NA RO, GU GU, ZHENG BU, head-circle—the four ornament letters—are called "the four letters of ornament."
[5481] YA tag, RA tag, foot-hook—the three end-supports or "four support letters."
[5482] When GU GU is double-stacked on the single [letters], it is called "straight placement."

[5508] KĪ is called a long single GU GU.
[5509] When NA RO is double-stacked, it is called upper and lower.
[5510] KOU is called a single foot-hook.
[5511] When GRENG BU is double-stacked, it is called GRENG and bent.
[5512] KEI is called a single GU GU.
[5513] Third, the expression manner of stacked letters:
[5514] When sounds are expressed like those suitable for life, etc.,
[5515] [
[5516] Please observe aside the classes of these letters.
[5517] 4 stacked letters. || 670 ||
[5518] Note.
[5519] ]Thus:
[5520] O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ is called.
[5521] Its meaning is:
[5522] The birthless pure dharmakāya,
[5523] The nature of wisdom, all dharmas non-dual,
[5524] Eternal wisdom, empty and cessationless,
[5525] Sphere arising from sphere,
[5526] Adorned by non-dual wisdom.
[5527] Therefore, the nature of the three-stacked sphere-wisdom. || 680 ||
[5528] This is also the Rigpa wisdom not transcending the equality of reality.
[5529] Light has two: the light of the realized person
[5530] And the light of sentient beings through non-realization.
[5531] For those endowed with realization, wisdom spontaneously arises in these very appearances.
[5532] Though the unrealized possess the five lights, they do not see them, and thus they are not indicated.
[5533] Thus also other abodes of stacked letters—
[5534] [
[5535] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5536] Stacked letter five—annotation.
[5537] Thus it is called: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA DHARMA KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA. || 690 ||
[5538] Within these established sounds: DHARMA KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA exist.
[5539] Their meaning:
[5540] The pure body is shown by actual sound;
[5541] the impure body is shown through establishment.
[5542] Therein, the pure wisdom-body:
[5543] This appearance, ceasing, immediately arises.
[5544] The impure sentient beings' body is this very appearance as concreteness.
[5545] The wisdom-body: rigpa at the heart, empty-cognizing, meaning-wisdom.
[5546] Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging—reversed from confusion.
[5547] Rigpa's wisdom reversed from the world. || 700 ||
[5548] Rigpa's compassion, unceasing, benefits beings.
[5549] Further, the stacked classes are shown:
[5550] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5551] Stacked letter six—annotation.
[5552] Thus it is: E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA; AD MA KO TSAG KRA BA LO KI.
[5553] Its meaning enters light:
[5554] rigpa's light, kāya's light, wisdom's light—these three gathered into dharmadhātu.
[5555] This too: from dharmatā's equality, not gone beyond.
[5556] For the non-dual meaning, wisdom's self-nature:
[5557] Emptiness stacked—emptiness of sambhogakāya's equality, meaning of complete enjoyment body. || 710 ||
[5558] Kāya beyond words,
[5559] pervaded by clear light,
[5560] whatever portion depends—nothing remains.
[5561] The path has three:
[5562] 1. The empty wisdom-path,
[5563] 2. The clear light-path,
[5564] 3. The unchanging rigpa's empty path.
[5565] First: the lamp of the bodhi path.
[5566] Second: wisdom's illusory body.
[5567] Third: the precious body. || 720 ||
[5568] These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste:
[5569] Dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond.
[5570] Further stacked classes:
[5571] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5572]

[5582]
[5583]
[5584]
[5585] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter seven—annotation.
[5586] Thus it is: SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—its meaning:
[5587] By wisdom's meaning, realized; || 740 ||
[5588] Time-unchanging wisdom, ignorance by nature conquered.
[5589] Dharmadhātu's equality, surrounded and endowed.
[5590] In self always existing, pervasion threefold endowed.
[5591] Equality-day's wisdom, self-arisen.
[5592] Further:
[5593] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter eight—annotation.
[5594] Thus it is: MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—accomplishing, MA LA MA LA DHA THIM DHA THIM—its meaning:
[5595] Self's rigpa, equal-pure body's form, realized.
[5596] That too, by self-arisen emptiness-wisdom, pervaded, realized.
[5597] That too, to self-entity's ground, complete parinirvāṇa, realized. || 750 ||
[5598] Three kāyas, gathering-separating without, meaning realized.
[5599] All dharmas, equality, non-dual, realized.
[5600] From that, compassion unceasing, like sun-rays, shines.
[5601] Conceptual wisdom, self-place grasped.
[5602] Further:
[5603] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter nine—annotation.
[5604] Thus it is: TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—
[5605] Unchanging, three kāyas' ground, pressed.
[5606] All-times wisdom, always abiding, dharma-pure wisdom-heart possessed;
[5607] Equality-wisdom's self-nature become. || 760 ||
[5608] To emptiness, three compassions, one time arising—that too, unceasing manner, equality-wisdom's kāya, not gone beyond.
[5609] Unchanging wisdom, self-constituent, explained.
[5610] Sound's place, many letters stacked: vowel and NA RO below, in order given, with GU GU, thus read;
[5611] Head-circle below's top, placed.
[5612] This letter-place is the bind of seventeen tantras' internals;
[5613] Wherever tantra's place arises, thus understand.
[5614] These stacked letter examples, from Samantabhadra's mind-mirror arisen, like.
[5615] This letter-wheel's order, tantra's difficult place, is.

[5626] Know meaning great penetrate thinking here well established.
[5627] Second topic introduction definite enumerate explained two: || 780 ||
[5628] Generally shown and,
[5629] Particularly explained.
[5630] First is:
[5631] Secret unsurpassed tantras meanings minds types two bound explained,
[5632] Awareness self-appearance mind-possessors mind,
[5633] Tantra name-meaning division and,
[5634] Focus object mind-possessors mind tantra text definitely shown.
[5635] Thus also from Talgyur:
[5636] E MA tantra definite arisen,
[5637] Minds types two are, || 790 ||
[5638] Awareness self-appearance mind-possessors,
[5639] Tantra name-meaning divided,
[5640] Symbol sound meaning three by,
[5641] Reality direct path made,
[5642] Three realms saṃsāra continuum cut,
[5643] Outside reverse not,
[5644] Exhaustion characteristics know.
[5645] Focus object mind-possessors,
[5646] Tantra text meaning divided,
[5647] Whatever whatever certain key point, || 800 ||
[5648] Each key point inserted,
[5649] Not-separated completely realized,
[5650] Saṃsāra pure abide not,
[5651] Elaborations joy person,
[5652] Various means trained become,
[5653] That also individual siddhis obtained.
[5654] Mind key point oral instruction,
[5655] Individual occasions know.
[5656] Thus it is spoken.
[5657] Here explanation manner four person's mind types liberated divided: || 810 ||
[5658] Mind elaborations with those introduction five perfections manner tantra outer explained,
[5659] Mind elaborations without those text meaning oral instruction definite inner explained,
[5660] Mind very elaborations without those name self-text realize secret explained,
[5661] Mind extremely elaborations without those tantra meaning condensed secret unsurpassed Great Perfection explained.
[5662] First is:
[5663] The tantra-body's introduction,
[5664] Which arises from the introduction-base, explains the meaning of the twofold introduction.
[5665] Second: Those meanings are summarized through the eleven words of instruction, establishing the eleven categories of verbal meaning.
[5666] Third:
[5667] Thus the eleven are gathered into cutting-through and crossing-over, binding the two stages of practice, explained thus. || 820 ||
[5668] Fourth:
[5669] All are gathered into the single meaning of direct awareness, suitable to awareness itself.
[5670] Thus the fourfold Great Secret is established in meaning.
[5671] The root vajra's four bonds are named:
[5672] The great Paṇḍita Vimalamitra's supreme view.
[5673] Second, explained particularly in three parts:
[5674] The connection of the two introduction-bases.
[5675] The individual meanings extensively explained.
[5676] Abandoning mistaken refutations.
[5677] First: || 830 ||
[5678] The tantra's meaning is summarized,
[5679] The title shown,
[5680] The twofold text.
[5681] The body of the text arranged,
[5682] The limbs extensively explained in two parts.
[5683] The body extensively explained, briefly shown, gathered.
[5684] Through the introduction-base, all tantras are shown to arise.
[5685] From the Treasury:
[5686] The clear sequence of words spoken,
[5687] The title shown, and through the text, || 840 ||
[5688] The minds of length and instant, variously.
[5689] To be realized, variously explained.
[5690] The twofold text-types distinguished.
[5691] The body itself arranged,
[5692] The limbs' meaning extensively divided.
[5693] The body's introduction-base is twofold.
[5694] Thus it is.
[5695] Each of the two introductions:
[5696] The teacher perfected,
[5697] The place perfected, || 850 ||
[5698] The retinue perfected,
[5699] The dharma perfected,
[5700] The time perfected, abiding as fivefold.
[5701] From the Sun-Moon Union:
[5702] The great secret tantras,
[5703] Possessing the five perfections.
[5704] Common and uncommon,
[5705] The seeds of the introduction-bases.
[5706] Thus.
[5707] From the Treasury: || 860 ||
[5708] The first of the four introductions arising from the tantra.
[5709] Holding the seeds of the five.
[5710] Thus it is spoken.
[5711] These two perfections give rise to the fivefold reasons, namely:
[5712] Common and uncommon reasons.
[5713] First:
[5714] Whatever tantra has arisen, the teacher and retinue are therein certain to be taught.
[5715] That time and place are certain to exist.
[5716] Those gathered simultaneously arise in time.
[5717] Second: || 870 ||
[5718] When matter and consciousness gather, the body serves as support, placed in a certain abode.
[5719] In the field of form aggregates,
[5720] The consciousness as teacher,
[5721] Gathered with perception as retinue.
[5722] The teaching of feeling arises.
[5723] Formations have five times, certain.
[5724] Those five impure aggregates of the disciple-base are
[5725] Tamed by the five perfections of the introduction-base.
[5726] Suitable for disciple and method.
[5727] From that itself: || 880 ||
[5728] The individual persons of disciples.
[5729] The five types of disciple-base aggregates.
[5730] The introduction-base of that method.
[5731] Thus it is spoken.
[5732] That also is called the five perfections of the introduction-base, namely:
[5733] Basis:
[5734] Abode,
[5735] Time,
[5736] Teacher,
[5737] Retinue, || 890 ||
[5738] The five dharmas.
[5739] Each of those also becomes threefold.
[5740] From the Treasury:
[5741] The introduction is expressed in words.
[5742] The basis has five types.
[5743] Abode is accepted as threefold.
[5744] What is called perfection is gathered.
[5745] The three appear as numbers.
[5746] The gathering of qualities is complete.
[5747] The teacher himself is also threefold. || 900 ||
[5748] What is called perfection is the completion of the kāyas.
[5749] The three kāyas arise as three.
[5750] The gathering of retinue is assembled.
[5751] The retinue is also threefold.
[5752] What is called perfection is arranged in form.
[5753] The three appear as various gatherings.
[5754] The gathering of faith and aspiration.
[5755] The teaching itself is also threefold.
[5756] What is called perfection is the very essence.
[5757] The three are the precious collections. || 910 ||
[5758] The gathering liberates persons.
[5759] Time also has three gathering into four.
[5760] The perfection of all vehicles.
[5761] The three are past, present,
[5762] The gathering is definitively complete.
[5763] Thus.
[5764] Second, the individual meanings extensively explained in two parts.
[5765] Uncommon introduction and,
[5766] Common introduction extensively explained.
[5767] First is: || 920 ||
[5768] Awareness wisdom abiding manner five perfections possessing abiding,
[5769] Uncommon introduction expressed shown.
[5770] That also clear light tantras beginning,
[5771] Thus I taught time once,
[5772] Thus arising is.
[5773] Manner basis thing nature abode ultimate truth showing,
[5774] Vehicles dark sūtra tantra surpassing,
[5775] From Talgyur:
[5776] Uncommon distinguished,
[5777] Vehicles all surpassing sign. || 930 ||
[5778] Thus it is spoken.
[5779] Here divide two:
[5780] Basis thing nature abode five perfections possessing shown and,
[5781] That arrangement body how abiding five perfections.
[5782] First is:
[5783] Abode perfection,
[5784] Reality elaborations free characteristics wherever not-established,
[5785] Words letters sphere not.
[5786] Thing abiding manner teacher perfection:
[5787] Elaboration-basis word only not thing signs not-established self-arisen awareness. || 940 ||
[5788] Teacher that retinue perfection.
[5789] Reality's play wisdom ocean's collection.
[5790] Teaching perfection,
[5791] Nature equality dharmadhātu ultimate abode Great Perfection tathātā.
[5792] Time perfection,
[5793] All not-separate one and many both not reality inconceivable clear light great time.
[5794] Thus also:
[5795] From Ratnaketu:
[5796] Not-existing empty dharmadhātu from,
[5797] Primordial first Buddha by, || 950 ||
[5798] Awareness and wisdom distinction from,
[5799] Reality empty self-sound,
[5800] Primordially dharma wheel turned,
[5801] Beginning middle end without.
[5802] Thus spoken and:
[5803] Secret great's self-sphere in,
[5804] Primordially abiding from,
[5805] Not-grasped abode manner possessing,
[5806] Play great first arisen.
[5807] Thus it is spoken. || 960 ||
[5808] Second body's five perfections:
[5809] Abode perfection,
[5810] CITTA jewel palace channel essence great center in,
[5811] Teacher perfection,
[5812] Self-arisen awareness clear light supreme unchanging nature nature compassion three nature,
[5813] Five kāyas,
[5814] Five wisdoms,
[5815] Five lights,
[5816] Five wisdoms,
[5817] Five winds, || 970 ||
[5818] Bindu tiny etcetera retinue perfection surrounding,
[5819] Dharma perfection,
[5820] Channel wind bindu key points and,
[5821] Key point arisen bliss-clear non-conceptual wisdom advice practice experience with,
[5822] Time perfection,
[5823] Awareness meaning familiar self-arisen self arisen,
[5824] From Sun-Moon-Joined:
[5825] CITTA jewel palace,
[5826] Self-awareness wisdom manifest arisen,
[5827] Wisdom self-arisen teacher great, || 980 ||
[5828] Kāyas and wisdoms bindus,
[5829] Non-conceptual enumerate retinue arisen,
[5830] Advice practice teaching manner,
[5831] That familiar time also.
[5832] Thus and:
[5833] From Talgyur:
[5834] Retinue and transcended beginning,
[5835] Self-arisen made without from,
[5836] Elements gathered aggregates arisen,
[5837] Earth water fire wind jewel four, || 990 ||
[5838] Center wind-mind cause and condition,
[5839] Gathered produced palace without,
[5840] Self-arisen awareness unaltered,
[5841] Delusion completely pure,
[5842] Great bliss gathered means retinue,
[5843] Kāyas and wisdoms wisdom winds,
[5844] Not-divide various focus without,
[5845] Channel wind means great bliss dharmas,
[5846] Individual experience suitable explained.
[5847] Past future present not, || 1000 ||
[5848] Not-divide division completely not,
[5849] All self-arisen wisdom.
[5850] Thus it is spoken.
[5851] Incidentally mind gathered one gathered five perfections:
[5852] The perfection of place—
[5853] Within the vast and open sky of dharmadhātu's spacious expanse,
[5854] The perfection of teacher—
[5855] Samantabhadra, gathering the hosts of self-mind's delusion-appearances.
[5856] The perfection of retinue—
[5857] The five outer objects, || 1010 ||
[5858] The six inner thought-collections, habitual delusion-appearances.
[5859] The perfection of teaching—
[5860] The dharmas of saṃsāra: grasping, holding, self, other, karma, and afflictions.
[5861] The perfection of time—
[5862] From beginningless and endless time, the moment consciousness grasps at appearances through conceptual analysis, absorption, higher realms, and habitual tendencies.
[5863] In summary: delusion-appearances arisen in mind, the dharmas of saṃsāra gathered under the name of five perfections are shown,
[5864] From the Ratnaketu Tantra:
[5865] From the pure aspect of appearance-making and grasping,
[5866] Outer objects appear like a retinue.
[5867] Thus it is spoken. || 1020 ||
[5868] Second, the common prologue extensively explained:
[5869] From the Thalgyur:
[5870] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue,
[5871] The chief of marvelous, supreme gathered teachings.
[5872] The common prologue of causes and conditions,
[5873] To accord with the door of other scriptures,
[5874] Is famously called "common."
[5875] Thus:
[5876] As it appears in the scriptures and tantras of common vehicles,
[5877] So too in this great secret definitive tantra, || 1030 ||
[5878] Following the uncommon prologue,
[5879] "Thus have I heard at one time," and so forth, is spoken.
[5880] That also shows accordance with all vehicle scriptures,
[5881] For the meaning is uncommon;
[5882] That meaning is shown through explanation,
[5883] Abandoning doubt about where, when, by which teacher, to which retinue, this doctrine was taught—the common prologue is spoken with these in mind.
[5884] How is it spoken? At the time the tantra arose, where was the place?
[5885] That teacher, being of one essence with the three kāyas, must speak;
[5886] The manner:
[5887] Dharmakāya—speech of meaning-essence through blessing, || 1040 ||
[5888] Saṃbhogakāya—speech that distinguishes pure, clear self-nature,
[5889] Nirmāṇakāya—speech in the manner of the sixty melodious speech-qualities, well-arranged in word and verse.
[5890] Those words also, from the hearer's consciousness,
[5891] Arise without sound or letters in meaning.
[5892] From the Uttaratantra:
[5893] Like an echo, without letters,
[5894] Thus it is spoken.
[5895] As the sound of an echo—
[5896] Arising from another's awareness,
[5897] Without concept, without fabrication, || 1050 ||
[5898] Thus is the Tathāgata's speech.
[5899] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5900] Neither abiding outside nor within.
[5901] By this manner.
[5902] Regarding that, the places where the tantra arises are of three types:
[5903] Dharmakāya's abode:
[5904] Within the great palace of dharmadhātu,
[5905] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[5906] To the gathering of the ocean of wisdom-retinue,
[5907] The Dharma of Great Perfection, self-nature, || 1060 ||
[5908] At the time beyond expression of dharmatā,
[5909] Is spoken without words or letters.
[5910] Saṃbhogakāya's abode:
[5911] Within the dense array of complete purity,
[5912] Teacher Saṃbhogakāya Vairocana, to the retinue—the five rigpa-Buddhas,
[5913] The five mothers such as Ākāśadhātvīśvarī,
[5914] Bodhisattvas such as Kṣitigarbha,
[5915] Consorts such as Mohinī,
[5916] Within the self-appearing maṇḍala filling the whole of space,
[5917] Enumerates the unsurpassed Great Vehicle Dharma— || 1070 ||
[5918] Though not spoken from tongue with the vowel-sounds of the six letters' self-sound, makes understood
[5919] At the time of wisdom's self-appearance.
[5920] Nirmāṇakāya's abode: Tuṣita upper chamber and so forth,
[5921] Teacher Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, abiding in wisdom-illusion body,
[5922] To retinue transcending the world, appearing as guides of the fortunate, and
[5923] Bodhisattvas,
[5924] Siddhas,
[5925] Wisdom ḍākinīs,
[5926] Worldly retinue—gods,
[5927] Humans, || 1080 ||
[5928] Asuras,
[5929] Garuḍas,
[5930] Gandharvas,
[5931] Nāgas, and countless others,
[5932] Teaches inconceivable sūtras and tantras,
[5933] For time spanning eons immeasurable to a hundred.
[5934] These are called the perfection of abode, occasion, and time,
[5935] From the Thalgyur:
[5936] The bases are of five types,
[5937] The abodes are held to be of three types. || 1090 ||
[5938] This is the meaning.
[5939] Also from the Ratnaketu:
[5940] Dharmakāya, self-pure grasping,
[5941] Within the self-pure elaborationless celestial palace,
[5942] To the retinue of appearances inseparable from itself,
[5943] By means of signless speech,
[5944] Elaborationless dharmas,
[5945] Arise from mind as non-abiding, self-exhausted.
[5946] Without spoken, without speech,
[5947] Shown in the state of great equality. || 1100 ||
[5948] By Saṃbhogakāya, self-clear and pure,
[5949] From the pure celestial palace of five lights,
[5950] By means of elaborationless great bliss speech,
[5951] To the retinue of the five kāyas and families,
[5952] Entityless, pure dharmas
[5953] Arise from mind as five wisdoms gathered.
[5954] From the tongue spreading pure light-rays,
[5955] The six self-arisen letters also,
[5956] Great self-arisen shown without speaking.
[5957] By Nirmāṇakāya without attachment, || 1110 ||
[5958] Dharma also from the disciple's own abode,
[5959] To the fortunate awakened from the six families,
[5960] By means of speech with words and elaborations,
[5961] Whatever dharmas faculties desire,
[5962] From mind, self-clear mindfulness,
[5963] Spread upon the tongue of faculties without desire,
[5964] Shown as dharmas of numbered vehicles.
[5965] Thus by the excellent explanation of three kāyas and speech,
[5966] The minds of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and
[5967] All Buddhas are satisfied; || 1120 ||
[5968] Thus the hopes of beings are fulfilled.
[5969] Thus it is spoken.
[5970] Thus, when the meaning and purpose of the two prologues shown are arranged:
[5971] "Thus at one time I taught" means
[5972] Vajrapāṇi, having promised "I shall teach the retinue completely what I heard from glorious Samantabhadra before," or
[5973] Vajrapāṇi himself, accepting to be the teacher of the tantra, taught to the retinue saying "I taught."
[5974] From the Thalgyur:
[5975] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue.
[5976] Thus it is spoken.
[5977] That also, Vajradhara is Buddha; || 1130 ||
[5978] From the Śrīparamādi:
[5979] Buddha before all Buddhas,
[5980] Vajradhara, king, vajra-mind.
[5981] Thus it is spoken.
[5982] From the Training Tantra:
[5983] Buddha before all Buddhas,
[5984] Destroyer of all ignorance's stains.
[5985] Vajra, Vajra-holder, king,
[5986] Vajra, Vajra, Vajra-holder,
[5987] Vajrapāṇi, Mahāmudrā. || 1140 ||
[5988] Thus it is spoken.
[5989] "Thus at one time I heard" means: Vajrapāṇi, at the time when I actually heard before from teacher Samantabhadra, great Vajradhara—
[5990] Thinking that the compiler's Dharma was awakened into by former victors having accepted it into heart,
[5991] And the lineage unbroken in the middle,
[5992] And the meaning of the three times' Dharma enumerations harmonious,
[5993] Is shown in order to generate faith in the retinue.
[5994] From the Thalgyur:
[5995] In order to accord with the door of other vehicles,
[5996] By means of the common prologue,
[5997] To the compiler's own retinue, || 1150 ||
[5998] In order to make faith,
[5999] It is shown—from the disciple as the basis,
[6000] By making taming,
[6001] Arisen, makes the teaching abide.
[6002] Thus it is spoken.
[6003] Third: abandoning refutations of wrong understanding:
[6004] Some, having no opportunity to view the form of the vast ocean of Dharma with the closed eye of intellect, say:
[6005] "In other sūtras and tantras, 'Thus have I heard' is spoken,
[6006] 'Taught' does not arise here, so it is fabricated."
[6007] If "taught" becomes fabricated, || 1160 ||
[6008] From the Cakrasamvara Root Tantra:
[6009] "Then the secret must be taught,"
[6010] Thus it is spoken;
[6011] That also has the fault of falling into fabrication.
[6012] Moreover, if saying that showing twice is not valid,
[6013] It follows that the entirety of the melodious-expressed section is not valid;
[6014] For the purpose of showing, after one prose, one verse is repeated,
[6015] And showing the name twice also follows as not valid.
[6016] Therefore, showing the arising of the meaning-tantra is the uncommon prologue;
[6017] Showing the arising of the word-tantra, indicating, is the common prologue— || 1170 ||
[6018] Upon the non-contradictory, again very connected, it is shown.
[6019] By these, the definitive meaning of the prologue is shown.
[6020] Knowing this much, in order to know the structure and understood meaning of the tantras, it is arranged and established here in this context.
[6021] Third meaning: the prophecy of the sacred definitive teaching—
[6022] The teaching of vajra-essence,
[6023] The seed-kāya of the teaching,
[6024] The self-arisen letter,
[6025] The three vajras,
[6026] The sequence of persons holding these, arising before and after—
[6027] Showing these three meanings: the manner of the teaching's descent generally shown, || 1180 ||
[6028] Its flourishing and decline explained in particular,
[6029] The persons who hold it shown.
[6030] First:
[6031] At the time of the arrangement of the great Brahma aeon by primordial Samantabhadra,
[6032] From that blessing, the Buddha-emanation Vajradhara arose from dharmakāya to saṃbhogakāya;
[6033] At the time of the kāyas such as Vairocana, arranging the great Brahma aeon,
[6034] Acting for the benefit of disciples through various emanation-kāyas—
[6035] At the beginning of that aeon, the actual teaching of Great Perfection to dharmakāya,
[6036] The teaching-sound of saṃbhogakāya self-sounding,
[6037] Acting for benefit through the manifestation-appearance of emanation-kāya, || 1190 ||
[6038] And the vajra arisen from that blessing,
[6039] The texts,
[6040] The kāya images gradually descended,
[6041] Holding the actual and reflected teaching—
[6042] The spontaneous arising of benefit for sentient beings from Buddha:
[6043] From the aeon of the first emanation's awakening,
[6044] Before this field was formed at that time, going as emanation to other fields and acting for benefit,
[6045] Now acting for benefit through the appearance of a thousand Buddhas in this Saha field—these are the blessings of the three.
[6046] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6047] The seventeen definitive secret commands, || 1200 ||
[6048] Together with the teaching's light-arrow and miraculous letter,
[6049] At the beginning of the emanation-kāya's field,
[6050] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[6051] Held in the place of dense array.
[6052] Then in the abode of Tuṣita,
[6053] Rigpa-Vairocana,
[6054] Holding this, ripened the five rigpas.
[6055] Past that, held by me,
[6056] The sacred life-tree of the teaching—
[6057] A thousand Buddhas and two roots, || 1210 ||
[6058] Relying upon this, definitively arise.
[6059] Miraculous and egg-born,
[6060] Warmth and womb-born,
[6061] Ripen sentient beings.
[6062] From this very teaching of disciples,
[6063] Twelve Dharma wheels arose.
[6064] By this, thirty-six deeds
[6065] Relying upon the three kāyas,
[6066] Appear to sentient beings, objects of disciples.
[6067] Thus it is spoken. || 1220 ||
[6068] If these manners are extensively shown:
[6069] After Vajradhara, having arranged the great Brahma aeon, passed through numberless, inconceivable aeons,
[6070] At the beginning of this field's formation,
[6071] From here, in the northern direction, in the field called "Moving-Possessing,"
[6072] Those three seeds of the teaching abide.
[6073] In that field, through the individual karma of sentient beings,
[6074] The seven times of arising of these,
[6075] The seven times of non-arising—fourteen—became flourishing and decline.
[6076] From that, the seven times of arising are:
[6077] Endowment, || 1230 ||
[6078] Perfection,
[6079] Great Perfection,
[6080] Two-Possessing,
[6081] Three-Possessing,
[6082] Strife-Possessing,
[6083] Great Strife-Possessing.
[6084] Between each of those, declining, are called the seven dark aeons.
[6085] Then, the vessel and environment of this field formed; at the first aeon, in Tuṣita stacked,
[6086] The teacher came;
[6087] Those three seeds descended here, || 1240 ||
[6088] Made to flourish and decline by the seven sequences,
[6089] Finally leaping to another.
[6090] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6091] Thus to this very teaching,
[6092] The remaining teaching thus,
[6093] Explained as definitively great by time.
[6094] Endowment and Perfection,
[6095] Perfections, the great,
[6096] Thus Two-Possessing and Three-Possessing,
[6097] Strife-Possessing and Great Strife, || 1250 ||
[6098] Between each of those,
[6099] In sixty dark aeons,
[6100] The teaching's seed becomes other.
[6101] The northern direction, Moving-Possessing,
[6102] The teaching's lamp abides there,
[6103] Called "Glorious Protector,"
[6104] Monks will hold.
[6105] That patron, the king,
[6106] Called Jinamitra,
[6107] Makes the secret basis of the teaching. || 1260 ||
[6108] Abides for one thousand three hundred years.
[6109] Then the dark aeon
[6110] Abides between sixty.
[6111] Then the southern direction, Sthalaskandha,
[6112] In the wide and beautiful continent,
[6113] The teaching's life-tree descended there,
[6114] Called "Joy-Glorious,"
[6115] By the Tuṣita family gathering,
[6116] This teaching will be held.
[6117] That patron, householder family, || 1270 ||
[6118] Called "Virtue-Accomplishment,"
[6119] Makes to abide for a hundred years.
[6120] Then becomes the dark aeon,
[6121] Becomes one hundred twenty years.
[6122] Then the eastern direction, Bliss River,
[6123] At the peak of Vajra-Arising Mountain,
[6124] This sacred teaching descended,
[6125] Called "Sūtra Collection,"
[6126] The king himself holds the teaching.
[6127] That patron, the brahmin, || 1280 ||
[6128] Called Jayākara,
[6129] Abides for one thousand four hundred years.
[6130] After that, the dark aeon
[6131] Becomes five thousand years.
[6132] Then the western direction, Affection Continent,
[6133] Called Bhatisali,
[6134] Also to the good family of beings,
[6135] Again the three essences descended,
[6136] Also by the monk Bliss-Protector,
[6137] This sacred teaching held, || 1290 ||
[6138] That patron, the hero
[6139] By outcaste family for a thousand years,
[6140] Made this abiding and flourishing.
[6141] After that passed, darkness below,
[6142] Abides for five thousand years.
[6143] Then again descended here,
[6144] To the place called Vajra Seat,
[6145] This flourishing, light blazing,
[6146] For five hundred fifty years.
[6147] This is held by Lodrö Zangpo; || 1300 ||
[6148] That patron, a ḍākinī,
[6149] Made cool and pure.
[6150] After that, this world,
[6151] Earth, water, fire, and wind clash and disturb,
[6152] Becomes the non-abiding great emptiness.
[6153] From the first called aeon,
[6154] The time of final destruction arises.
[6155] Thus it is spoken.
[6156] Lodrö Zangpo is all who hold this;
[6157] Five hundred years is a great year, || 1310 ||
[6158] Passed in five hundreds.
[6159] That much appearing to humans from the first aeon to this interval of ten years of life, the primordial—
[6160] Others, not, do benefit in the abode of ḍākinīs.
[6161] Second, the particular explanation of flourishing and decline:
[6162] In this Jambudvīpa, now, until the primordial, the seven types of flourishing and decline arising in this interval of ten years of life are:
[6163] From the Great Arrangement of Ati:
[6164] Listen, fortunate Śāriputra,
[6165] The sacred teaching's vast, great arrangement,
[6166] The supreme essence repeatedly gathered,
[6167] This gold-essence sun-illuminator, || 1320 ||
[6168] Does not flourish mixed with the common,
[6169] Appears to some possessing the great secret family.
[6170] In the time of degenerate strife-possessing, coarse affliction,
[6171] Factions, internal quarrels, all hermitages destroyed.
[6172] Royal law not abiding, self-pride, kingly conduct of desire,
[6173] Father and son quarrel, weapons protect bodies.
[6174] Accumulated groups lost, earth's essences exhausted,
[6175] Unsuitable views and conduct also many arise.
[6176] Five hundred degenerations, life years gradually decline,
[6177] Life of sixty years, little merit and fortune, || 1330 ||
[6178] This essence abides for sixty years.
[6179] After that passed, in the interval of a hundred years,
[6180] This secret not abiding, conduct of reasoning.
[6181] After that passed, even in a thousand years,
[6182] From the person without study and contemplation,
[6183] This supreme secret becomes like the sun.
[6184] After that passed, becomes darkness for two hundred.
[6185] Then, when life years are forty,
[6186] This essence abides for the interval of a hundred years.
[6187] After that passed, becomes darkness for thirty. || 1340 ||
[6188] After that passed, abiding for the interval of a hundred years,
[6189] When beings' life is thirty years,
[6190] This supreme secret declines, flourishes for eight hundred years of distant benefit,
[6191] This not arising when life is twenty.
[6192] When life is ten years, this essence arises;
[6193] Whoever meets this, arising self-dissolves.
[6194] The teaching's seed dissolved in sky, not appearing to people,
[6195] Again, the teaching's ember becomes other.
[6196] Thus it is spoken.
[6197] From the Sound Thalgyur: || 1350 ||
[6198] The near cause of destroying the teaching—
[6199] In those individual abodes,
[6200] Called "person possessing wrong desire,"
[6201] Each, by all teaching,
[6202] Is the near cause of destroying.
[6203] This, at the first time of darkness,
[6204] In the west of Jambudvīpa,
[6205] A king with six fingers on the hand,
[6206] Having blue extra teeth in front,
[6207] On the right hand's wrist, || 1360 ||
[6208] A black mole, shape of sin,
[6209] Possessing great terror—
[6210] The Buddha's teaching becomes darkness.
[6211] Becomes for the interval of sixty years.
[6212] Then, first held by Palden;
[6213] After passing one thousand three hundred,
[6214] Again, in the north of Jambudvīpa,
[6215] At the root of the radiant mountain,
[6216] An ascetic's form without loving mind,
[6217] Two ears on the right, || 1370 ||
[6218] Eyes with three corners, eyelids covering upward.
[6219] This, quarreling with tīrthika factions,
[6220] Darkness for sixty years.
[6221] After that, called Deva of Bliss,
[6222] Makes flourishing for the interval of a hundred years.
[6223] After that passed, in the northeast of Jambudvīpa,
[6224] At the root where the great river Rab-me flows,
[6225] A king's body possessing merit,
[6226] Not having even one eye,
[6227] Coarse limbs, powerful body, || 1380 ||
[6228] Adorned with archery and craft.
[6229] By this, suppressing the Dharma-doer,
[6230] The teaching for sixty years.
[6231] Here, from the west, becomes other.
[6232] After that passed, in Pratyekabuddha form,
[6233] Arising from Vajra Seat to the west.
[6234] By that, the sacred teaching
[6235] Abides for one hundred twenty years.
[6236] After that passed, below, in the center of Jambudvīpa,
[6237] In the place called Golden City, || 1390 ||
[6238] An elder's body with two tongue-tips,
[6239] Small hump, short limbs,
[6240] Factions quarreling, holding weapons.
[6241] By this arising, also darkness,
[6242] For the interval of sixty years.
[6243] After that passed, below, in the east of Jambudvīpa,
[6244] The rivers Lokita,
[6245] On the right-direction banks,
[6246] Called Glorious Lion,
[6247] Abides for one thousand four hundred years. || 1400 ||
[6248] Then again, in the center of Jambudvīpa,
[6249] On the bank of the great river Gaṅgā,
[6250] A king's son, shoulder
[6251] Similar to the color of down,
[6252] Ordained, four fingers measure.
[6253] By this arising, also darkness,
[6254] For the interval of sixty years.
[6255] After that passed, below, in Kāmarūpa,
[6256] The monastery called Śīla,
[6257] That master, protector of youth, || 1410 ||
[6258] By this, abides for the interval of a thousand.
[6259] After that, in the south of Jambudvīpa,
[6260] The town called Brahma's Island,
[6261] To a common family, lion head
[6262] This, three months after birth,
[6263] Becomes darkness for the interval of sixty.
[6264] After that, at Vulture Peak,
[6265] By the monk Śobhya-youth,
[6266] Abides for five hundred fifty years.
[6267] After that passed, below, at the border of Jambudvīpa, || 1420 ||
[6268] In the land called Kāśmīra,
[6269] In the sound-possessing city,
[6270] Bird body, human face,
[6271] Born among low-caste families.
[6272] This, ten years after birth,
[6273] Becomes darkness for sixty.
[6274] After that passed, below, in Jambudvīpa,
[6275] In the center, five yojanas to the east,
[6276] By the monk Śākya Jīka,
[6277] This, for the interval of ten years, || 1430 ||
[6278] Becomes like a blazing lamp.
[6279] Thus by the seven sequences,
[6280] Flourishing and decline are made in Jambudvīpa.
[6281] Thus it is spoken.
[6282] Thus, the seven complete flourishing and declining, after life of ten years, below, up to here, the three seeds of the teaching do not abide in this field;
[6283] From here, descended to the field of beautiful arrangement in the southern direction, at the time of the completion of that field's deeds by the seven flourishing and declining,
[6284] The time of Saha's emptiness;
[6285] Again, those three leap to the vast protector world of the northern direction,
[6286] After the Buddha Beautiful-Utpala-Flower held and did the seven flourishing and declining,
[6287] Leap to the world called "Vast Sound Topknot" in the western direction, || 1440 ||
[6288] After the Buddha Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra held and abided for seven hundred-thousand years in the manner of seven flourishing and declining,
[6289] All beings of all fields existing in the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, along with that field, are liberated in the primordial ground;
[6290] The great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, with vessel and environment, becomes empty,
[6291] Abides for eighty-five aeons as one sky.
[6292] The three seeds of the teaching:
[6293] By Vajradhara's great deeds completed,
[6294] Dissolve themselves in the peaceful sphere of dharmatā, not appearing to people.
[6295] Then again, beings appearing from the sphere, and by emanation, arrange the great Brahma—
[6296] At the time when the teacher of taming-making came to the appearance of disciples for six hundred-thousand aeons,
[6297] From Samantabhadra's blessing, || 1450 ||
[6298] The three seeds of the teaching self-arose, explained as arising for the benefit of sentient beings without flourishing and decline.
[6299] From the Sound Thalgyur:
[6300] Then from the beautiful arrangement,
[6301] Leaped to those fields,
[6302] After life years of ten,
[6303] Here not abiding, appearing there.
[6304] Thus from completed flourishing and decline,
[6305] This essence of the sacred teaching,
[6306] In the vast protector world,
[6307] Making the Buddha's teaching abide— || 1460 ||
[6308] Called Beautiful-Utpala-Flower,
[6309] Teacher Buddha, Bhagavān,
[6310] In the palace of Sukhāvati's stacked,
[6311] With an assembly of five thousand,
[6312] All great bodhisattvas,
[6313] Having obtained patience in the unborn Dharma,
[6314] Only those possessing virtuous mind arise.
[6315] That very teacher came,
[6316] Tamed those possessing wrong desire,
[6317] This very sacred teaching || 1470 ||
[6318] For five thousand thousand years
[6319] Makes the essence of the teaching abide.
[6320] Then again, like the former,
[6321] Makes flourishing and decline by seven sequences.
[6322] After that, Tuṣita possessing sound,
[6323] In the vast world-realm,
[6324] Teacher Amitāyus, Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra,
[6325] Retinue of one hundred eight and a half,
[6326] All arhats with outflows exhausted,
[6327] Deed done, burden cast off. || 1480 ||
[6328] By that also, the essence of the teaching
[6329] Abides for seven hundred-thousand years.
[6330] By the sequence of former force,
[6331] Thus, from the passing of seven abidings,
[6332] Also for eighty-five aeons,
[6333] Dharmas dissolved into Buddha-kāya,
[6334] In whatever world-realm,
[6335] The Buddha's teaching does not abide.
[6336] Then to the lower world,
[6337] For six hundred-thousand aeons, || 1490 ||
[6338] The Buddha's teaching abides long;
[6339] In this, flourishing and decline do not arise,
[6340] Ripens beings.
[6341] Thus it is spoken.
[6342] That also, to the Buddha's teaching, actual and
[6343] From the two reflections:
[6344] Reflection is:
[6345] Pervading wherever in the six realms, from beings' aspiration and teacher's blessing.
[6346] From the three actual teachings:
[6347] The two teachings of dharmakāya and saṃbhogakāya—teacher's self-appearance, pure sphere, || 1500 ||
[6348] The palace of dharmadhātu, and
[6349] The two dense arrays of clear light,
[6350] Existing as the permanent, continuous wheel;
[6351] The common teaching of emanation-kāya, the sequence of sūtra and tantra, and
[6352] The two uncommon, great secret, definitive supreme vehicles—
[6353] Do not exist other than the realms of gods and humans possessing particular merit,
[6354] For ḍākinīs also exist in the realms of gods and humans.
[6355] In this great secret definitive teaching, for those meeting the three actual seeds of the teaching, liberation without effort is doubtless.
[6356] From the letter of speech-emanation,
[6357] Written in harmony with the body-color of whatever teaching the Buddha came to, || 1510 ||
[6358] Placed in a jewel casket, carried in the left armpit, reading from time to time, and
[6359] Making veneration and worship, liberation is also without effort—
[6360] Also in this life, long life,
[6361] Without disease,
[6362] All wishes accomplished,
[6363] Opportunity not found by demons and obstacles that lead astray,
[6364] Making the end of life blissful, without the suffering of severing illness at the time of death, and
[6365] For those seeing the door of introduction here, if so, seizing firm ground in the wisdom-lamp of the intermediate state, and
[6366] Even being of the vehicle holding mental analysis,
[6367] Birth in the pure field, and || 1520 ||
[6368] Even ordinary, meeting this great secret, liberation, etc.—immeasurable qualities exist as the support for birth in the higher blissful realm.
[6369] From the Thalgyur:
[6370] Making the sun very illuminating,
[6371] The three things of body, speech, and mind—
[6372] To whoever descended, without effort,
[6373] Definitely obtains Buddhahood.
[6374] Therefore the key point of blessing:
[6375] Also from the very speech-emanation,
[6376] Written with the teaching's color,
[6377] Placed in the left armpit, || 1530 ||
[6378] If read and held in time,
[6379] Complete awakening is certain without doubt.
[6380] Also if this tantra is constantly read,
[6381] By that also, becomes like the above.
[6382] Thus it is spoken.
[6383] From the Great Arrangement:
[6384] This, by whoever is held, is good—
[6385] All craft and art,
[6386] All treatises and sounds,
[6387] Become known as wished. || 1540 ||
[6388] This unsurpassed supreme secret,
[6389] If worship, praise, and honor are made,
[6390] Supreme and common accomplishments
[6391] Arise as wished.
[6392] By merely carrying this,
[6393] Scripture and oral instructions are held.
[6394] The jewel-light dispelling the world's darkness,
[6395] This lamp making appear—
[6396] To whoever it appears,
[6397] Elements self-liberate; || 1550 ||
[6398] Without doubt, becomes fortunate.
[6399] Thus it is spoken.
[6400] Third, showing the persons who hold, three:
[6401] The generally shown history of former arising,
[6402] Explaining the enumeration of obtained liberation,
[6403] Expressing the definite prophecy of vidyādhara.
[6404] First:
[6405] At the occasion of the arrangement of the field of the great Brahma teacher by primordial first king supreme Samantabhadra, having obtained clear light,
[6406] Vajradhara, and
[6407] That very teacher showing many other emanations of name-forms, arranged, and || 1560 ||
[6408] From that blessing, having become Buddha, other arranged great Brahma aeons filling the sky's limit, numberless, expression-transcended—some empty, and
[6409] Some abiding, and
[6410] Some destroying, and
[6411] From some formed and abiding,
[6412] Up to this great Brahma arranged by Vajradhara,
[6413] Again, by the clear light aeon of the secret essence, the sequence of taming beings—sixty-four hundred-thousand, and
[6414] From that, between-between, other aeons numberless-transcended arisen,
[6415] Explained here as those arisen of clear light essence;
[6416] That also, from primordial time until arriving at this field's sequence,
[6417] First, the primordial first teaching arose, || 1570 ||
[6418] Ripened numberless beings by the secret heart-essence.
[6419] Then, at the second teaching, the Buddha Śikhin, protector of the world,
