[5646] Sitting with the body generally hunched closes the channel-mouth of consciousness entry.
[5647] 
[5648] 
[5649] 


### PAGE 132

[5650] Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow.
[5651] Joining knee and chest draws ability of wisdom from the body's elements.
[5652] Crossing the hands at armpit or atop the knee ends the limits of action and latency.
[5653] Second, the vital of resting wisdom:
[5654] If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:
[5655] Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched,
[5656] There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.
[5657] Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,
[5658] Mind abides inward.
[5659] Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.
[5660] Through that reversal, heat arises in the outer body,
[5661] Experience of unborn dharmata arises inward.
[5662] Embracing and stretching the nape with the hands
[5663] Reverses navel action-wind.
[5664] Through that reversal, many conceptualities cease inward,
[5665] Increasing fully pure wisdom vision outward.
[5666] Such vitals are:
[5667] Body vital is ability,
[5668] Channel vital is to wind,
[5669] Wind vital is to mind.
[5670] Regarding Sambhogakaya posture also:
[5671] Sound explanation:
[5672] "Great elephant" expresses from the part of power and great vehicle, for that body vital lifts special wisdom.
[5673] Dividing meaning, from the two:
[5674] The vital of setting continuity:
[5675] Sleeping face-covered makes power to overcome the three existences.
[5676] Joining knee and chest makes basis for delusion to dawn as wisdom.
[5677] Extending the big toe outward to earth harms moving action-wind.
[5678] Pressing hand fingers to earth
[5679] Supports dharmata manifestly dawning.
[5680] Raising the nape a little makes conceptuality dawn as wisdom.
[5681] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5682] Face-covering overcomes the existence of attachment-holding of three doors.
[5683] Placing four hands and feet to earth,
[5684] Pushing outward with the placed foot big-toe reverses conceptuality action-wind.


### PAGE 133

[5685] Through that reversal, outer delusion vision ceases,
[5686] Heat arises in body and mind inward.
[5687] Pressing both hand-palms to earth reverses moving action-wind.
[5688] Through that reversal, outer bindus and small bindus dawn,
[5689] Experience without day and night arises inward.
[5690] Bending the nape a little reverses grasping action-wind.
[5691] Through that reversal, seeing outer body-vision,
[5692] Exhausts wind's movement inward.
[5693] Regarding Dharmakaya posture also:
[5694] Sound explanation:
[5695] Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything,
[5696] That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.
[5697] Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:
[5698] The vital of establishing continuity:
[5699] Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.
[5700] Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities.
[5701] Bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet empties the movement of action and affliction.
[5702] Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmata.
[5703] Carrying channels to the nape makes support without place to stick from dharmata's meaning.
[5704] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5705] Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl
[5706] Reverses pervading action-wind.
[5707] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5708] The continuum of affliction ceases cut inward.
[5709] Placing both hand-palms inward ceases grasping action-wind.
[5710] Through that ceasing, seeing outer wisdom vision,
[5711] The continuum of object-possessor grasping conceptuality ceases inward.
[5712] Resting the upper body in a gap and stretching the nape
[5713] Reverses emitting action-wind.
[5714] Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5715] The continuum of affliction ceases inward.
[5716] Moreover, pressing the Dharmakaya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.


### PAGE 134

[5717] Through pressing Sambhogakaya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.
[5718] Through pressing Nirmanakaya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.
[5719] Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:
[5720] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5721] "The door is that itself unmoving."
[5722] Looking as Nirmanakaya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.
[5723] That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.
[5724] Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.
[5725] Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power.
[5726] Looking as Sambhogakaya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.
[5727] Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,
[5728] All delusion ceases in one time.
[5729] Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmata.
[5730] Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness.
[5731] Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.
[5732] Looking as Dharmakaya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.
[5733] Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.
[5734] Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.
[5735] Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness.
[5736] Eye relaxation is the same for all.
[5737] Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:
[5738] Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.
[5739] Bending all finger joints destroys body action.
[5740] Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner.
[5741] Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.
[5742] Second, the three unmoving of speech:
[5743] Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.
[5744] 


### PAGE 135

[5745] Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom.
[5746] Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.
[5747] Third, the three unmoving of mind:
[5748] Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.
[5749] Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.
[5750] Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure.
[5751] That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—
[5752] The vital that frees from those.
[5753] Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:
[5754] Through three body abidings, separation from action;
[5755] Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising;
[5756] Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.
[5757] First three:
[5758] Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase samsara's delusion.
[5759] Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.
[5760] Placing action at the basis, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening.
[5761] Second three:
[5762] Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.
[5763] Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.
[5764] Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two.
[5765] Third, three vision abidings:
[5766] Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.
[5767] Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.
[5768] Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.
[5769] At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:
[5770] Arises through obtaining certainty at the basis of four powers.
[5771] Speech four measures arriving:
[5772] Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.
[5773] Mind four measures arriving:


### PAGE 136

[5774] Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.
[5775] That also: at the time of dharmata manifesting, the body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl,
[5776] Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.
[5777] That is the great perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.
[5778] Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,
[5779] Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.
[5780] At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness, arises through wind entering the central channel,
[5781] The great perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.
[5782] Through the pure action of secret empowerment,
[5783] Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5784] At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,
[5785] Arises through mind hitting channels and winds.
[5786] The great perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.
[5787] Arising through body action purified by wisdom-yeshe empowerment,
[5788] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5789] At exhaustion, the body going like dew on a dakini's ear,
[5790] Arises through mind entering the luminosity-net.
[5791] The great perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye, through word-empowerment body action purified,
[5792] Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5793] Those are shown nearby by examples—
[5794] The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.
[5795] The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning;
[5796] Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.
[5797] Speech basis also like the four visions and sequence:
[5798] Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.
[5799] This is the great perfection's expressive basis, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,
[5800] Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom.
[5801] Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:


### PAGE 137

[5802] Arises through purifying the self-essence of great perfection expressive words.
[5803] Through entering the resonance of pure certain freedom of great perfection expressive words,
[5804] Cutting elaboration-free meaning inward.
[5805] Speech going like an earthen jar child emerging from a rock gap,
[5806] Arises through compassion gathering into wisdom-yeshe power.
[5807] Through entering the transformation of speech with meaning exceeding great perfection's speak-think,
[5808] Cutting the end of holding words as very elaboration-free.
[5809] Speech arising like the manner of split rock,
[5810] Arises through letters abiding in channels entering wind bindus.
[5811] Through entering the sound of speech with inexpressible great perfection meaning,
[5812] Arises through leaving, exceeding the object of speech, very elaboration-free.
[5813] Expression arises as inexpressible meaning to example.
[5814] Mind's four signs also, to be known through the four visions and sequence:
[5815] Mind going like caught on a dakini's ear,
[5816] Arises through mixing awareness with luminosity.
[5817] Great perfection hold-free self-free, entering mind's vision,
[5818] Arises through completing elaboration-together empowerment.
[5819] Mind going like a person hit by poison thorns,
[5820] Arises through freeing into the expanse of unborn mind.
[5821] Great perfection unborn self-place free, entering mind's arising place,
[5822] Through completing empowerment of primordially non-existent elaboration.
[5823] Mind going without return basis like a person recovered from fever,
[5824] Arises through catching fully pure mind wind.
[5825] Great perfection primordially free without return basis, entering mind's abiding place,
[5826] Through very elaboration-free self-vision self-freeing.
[5827] Mind going like dying immediately after an arrow hits a person's heart,
[5828] Arises through habituation becoming special.
[5829] Great perfection momentary quick-doing measure, entering mind's life:


### PAGE 138

[5830] Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.
[5831] This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.
[5832] Moreover, body's basis, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[5833] Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.
[5834] Speech four: express basis,
[5835] Express condition,
[5836] Express object,
[5837] Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[5838] Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.
[5839] Mind four:
[5840] Memory,
[5841] No memory,
[5842] Non-arising,
[5843] Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[5844] Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.
[5845] Thus, signs dawning in body,
[5846] Known in essence-speech,
[5847] Confidence correcting mind,
[5848] Measure caught by dream,
[5849] Through diligence sequence:
[5850] Great: completely ceasing dreams,
[5851] Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.
[5852] Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[5853] No conceptuality of good or bad latency.
[5854] Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.
[5855] Thus the three abidings:
[5856] From the Mu tig phreng:
[5857] Abiding is the pure expanse,
[5858] Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[5859] Abiding are all visions.
[5860] Third, striking nails with three obtains:
[5861] Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[5862] Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[5863] Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[5864] Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."
[5865] Again from that itself:
[5866] Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[5867] Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[5868] Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.
[5869] Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[5870] Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;
[5871] 
[5872] 


### PAGE 139

[5873] Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;
[5874] Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into samsara of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;
[5875] Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvana's self-place.
[5876] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[5877] Through four great confidences of unchanging view,
[5878] Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.
[5879] Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
[5880] Concluding gathering through sixteen visions:
[5881] Vision,
[5882] Increase,
[5883] Obtain,
[5884] Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,
[5885] Completing the sixteen-ground vision:
[5886] Dharmata manifest vision: increase is eye;
[5887] Near increase: eye's that itself;
[5888] Obtain: seeing nadi;
[5889] Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.
[5890] Experience increase vision: increase is light;
[5891] Near increase: bindu;
[5892] Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;
[5893] Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.
[5894] Measure-arrive vision: increase is body;
[5895] Near increase: vision as father-mother;
[5896] Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;
[5897] Near obtain: mandala complete.
[5898] Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in body and wisdom;
[5899] Near increase: empty without focus;
[5900] Obtain: inexpressible;
[5901] Near obtain: dharmata not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.
[5902] Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions, having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,
[5903] Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."
[5904] Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result, complete here in freeing as light-body and
[5905] Freeing in the bardo.
[5906] 


### PAGE 140

[5907] From the Rig pa rang shar:
[5908] "Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.
[5909] In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.
[5910] That also: that person to whom introduction is shown—
