Mount Meru's side, rishis Agastya and Vashistha,
Samadhi meditation manner—like.</prose>
[5645] <ornament>Meaning divide-to, from the two:</ornament>
[5646] <prose>Sitting with the body generally hunched closes the channel-mouth of consciousness entry.</prose>
[5647] <prose>Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow.</prose>

[5651] <prose>If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:</prose>
[5652] <prose>Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched,</prose>
[5653] <prose>There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.</prose>
[5654] <prose>Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,</prose>
[5655] <prose>Mind abides inward.</prose>
[5656] <prose>Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.</prose>

[5662] <ornament>Such vitals are:</ornament>
[5663] <prose>Body vital is ability,</prose>

[5665] <prose>Wind vital is to mind.</prose>

For that body vital lifts special wisdom.</prose>
[5669] <ornament>Dividing meaning, from the two:</ornament>

[5678] <prose>Placing four hands and feet to earth,</prose>

[5688] <ornament>Regarding Dharmakaya posture also:</ornament>
[5689] <list>Sound explanation:</list>
[5690] <prose>Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything,</prose>
[5691] <prose>That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.</prose>
[5692] <ornament>Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:</ornament>
[5693] <ornament>The vital of establishing continuity:</ornament>
[5694] <prose>Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.</prose>
[5695] <prose>Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities.</prose>
[5696] <prose>Bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet
Empties the movement of action and affliction.</prose>
[5697] <prose>Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmata.</prose>

[5699] <ornament>Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:</ornament>
[5700] <prose>Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl</prose>
[5701] <prose>Reverses pervading action-wind.</prose>

[5710] <prose>Moreover, pressing the Dharmakaya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.</prose>
[5711] <prose>Through pressing Sambhogakaya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.</prose>
[5712] <prose>Through pressing Nirmanakaya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.</prose>
[5713] <ornament>Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:</ornament>
[5714] <tantra>From the Mu tig phreng ba:</tantra>
[5715] <verse>The door is that itself unmoving.</verse>
[5716] <tantra>Thus-by</tantra>
[5717] <prose>Looking as Nirmanakaya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.</prose>
[5718] <prose>That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.</prose>
[5719] <prose>Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.</prose>
[5720] <prose>Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power.</prose>
[5721] <prose>Looking as Sambhogakaya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.</prose>
[5722] <prose>Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,</prose>
[5723] <prose>All delusion ceases in one time.</prose>
[5724] <prose>Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmata.</prose>
[5725] <prose>Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness.</prose>
[5726] <prose>Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.</prose>
[5727] <prose>Looking as Dharmakaya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.</prose>
[5728] <prose>Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.</prose>
[5729] <prose>Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.</prose>
[5730] <prose>Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness.</prose>
[5731] <prose>Eye relaxation is the same for all.</prose>
[5732] <ornament>Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:</ornament>
[5733] <prose>Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.</prose>
[5734] <prose>Bending all finger joints destroys body action.</prose>
[5735] <prose>Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner.</prose>
[5736] <prose>Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.</prose>
[5737] <ornament>Second, the three unmoving of speech:</ornament>
[5738] <prose>Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.</prose>
[5739] <prose>Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom.</prose>
[5740] <prose>Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.</prose>
[5741] <ornament>Third, the three unmoving of mind:</ornament>
[5742] <prose>Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.</prose>
[5743] <prose>Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.</prose>
[5744] <prose>Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure.</prose>
[5745] <prose>That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—</prose>
[5746] <prose>The vital that frees from those.</prose>
[5747] <ornament>Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:</ornament>
[5748] <list>Through three body abidings, separation from action;</list>
[5749] <list>Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising;</list>
[5750] <list>Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.</list>
[5751] <ornament>First three:</ornament>
[5752] <prose>Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase samsara's delusion.</prose>
[5753] <prose>Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.</prose>
[5754] <prose>Placing action at the basis, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening.</prose>
[5755] <ornament>Second three:</ornament>
[5756] <prose>Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.</prose>
[5757] <prose>Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.</prose>
[5758] <prose>Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two.</prose>
[5759] <ornament>Third, three vision abidings:</ornament>
[5760] <prose>Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.</prose>
[5761] <prose>Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.</prose>
[5762] <prose>Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.</prose>
[5763] <ornament>At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:</ornament>
[5764] <prose>Arises through obtaining certainty at the basis of four powers.</prose>
[5765] <ornament>Speech four measures arriving:</ornament>
[5766] <prose>Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.</prose>
[5767] <ornament>Mind four measures arriving:</ornament>
[5768] <prose>Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.</prose>
[5769] <prose>That also: at the time of dharmata manifesting,
The body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl,</prose>
[5770] <prose>Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.</prose>
[5771] <prose>That is the great perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.</prose>
[5772] <prose>Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,</prose>
[5773] <prose>Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.</prose>
[5774] <prose>At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness,</prose>
[5775] <prose>Arises through wind entering the central channel,</prose>
[5776] <prose>The great perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.</prose>
[5777] <prose>Through the pure action of secret empowerment,</prose>
[5778] <prose>Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.</prose>
[5779] <prose>At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,</prose>
[5780] <prose>Arises through mind hitting channels and winds.</prose>
[5781] <prose>The great perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.</prose>
[5782] <prose>Arising through body action purified by wisdom-yeshe empowerment,</prose>
[5783] <prose>Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.</prose>
[5784] <prose>At exhaustion, the body going like dew on a dakini's ear,</prose>
[5785] <prose>Arises through mind entering the luminosity-net.</prose>
[5786] <prose>The great perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye,</prose>
[5787] <prose>Through word-empowerment body action purified,</prose>
[5788] <prose>Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.</prose>
[5789] <prose>Those are shown nearby by examples—</prose>
[5790] <prose>The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.</prose>
[5791] <prose>The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning;</prose>
[5792] <prose>Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.</prose>
[5793] <ornament>Speech basis also like the four visions and sequence:</ornament>
[5794] <prose>Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.</prose>
[5795] <prose>This is the great perfection's expressive basis, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,</prose>
[5796] <prose>Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom.</prose>
[5797] <prose>Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:</prose>
[5798] <prose>Arises through purifying the self-essence of great perfection expressive words.</prose>
[5799] <prose>Through entering the resonance of pure certain freedom of great perfection expressive words,</prose>
[5800] <prose>Cutting elaboration-free meaning inward.</prose>
[5801] <prose>Speech going like an earthen jar child emerging from a rock gap,</prose>
[5802] <prose>Arises through compassion gathering into wisdom-yeshe power.</prose>
[5803] <prose>Through entering the transformation of speech with meaning exceeding great perfection's speak-think,</prose>
[5804] <prose>Cutting the end of holding words as very elaboration-free.</prose>
[5805] <prose>Speech arising like the manner of split rock,</prose>
[5806] <prose>Arises through letters abiding in channels entering wind bindus.</prose>
[5807] <prose>Through entering the sound of speech with inexpressible great perfection meaning,</prose>
[5808] <prose>Arises through leaving, exceeding the object of speech, very elaboration-free.</prose>
[5809] <prose>Expression arises as inexpressible meaning to example.</prose>
[5810] <ornament>Mind's four signs also, to be known through the four visions and sequence:</ornament>
[5811] <prose>Mind going like caught on a dakini's ear,</prose>
[5812] <prose>Arises through mixing awareness with luminosity.</prose>
[5813] <prose>Great perfection hold-free self-free, entering mind's vision,</prose>
[5814] <prose>Arises through completing elaboration-together empowerment.</prose>
[5815] <prose>Mind going like a person hit by poison thorns,</prose>
[5816] <prose>Arises through freeing into the expanse of unborn mind.</prose>
[5817] <prose>Great perfection unborn self-place free, entering mind's arising place,</prose>
[5818] <prose>Through completing empowerment of primordially non-existent elaboration.</prose>
[5819] <prose>Mind going without return basis like a person recovered from fever,</prose>
[5820] <prose>Arises through catching fully pure mind wind.</prose>
[5821] <prose>Great perfection primordially free without return basis, entering mind's abiding place,</prose>
[5822] <prose>Through very elaboration-free self-vision self-freeing.</prose>
[5823] <prose>Mind going like dying immediately after an arrow hits a person's heart,</prose>
[5824] <prose>Arises through habituation becoming special.</prose>
[5825] <prose>Great perfection momentary quick-doing measure, entering mind's life:</prose>
[5826] <prose>Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.</prose>
[5827] <prose>This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.</prose>
[5828] <prose>Moreover, body's basis, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—</prose>
[5829] <prose>Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.</prose>
[5830] <ornament>Speech four:</ornament>
[5831] <list>Express basis,</list>
[5832] <list>Express condition,</list>
[5833] <list>Express object,</list>
[5834] <list>Express agent—free from the binding of four,</list>
[5835] <prose>Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.</prose>
[5836] <ornament>Mind four:</ornament>
[5837] <list>Memory,</list>
[5838] <list>No memory,</list>
[5839] <list>Non-arising,</list>
[5840] <list>Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,</list>
[5841] <prose>Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.</prose>
[5842] <ornament>Thus, signs dawning in body,</ornament>
[5843] <ornament>Known in essence-speech,</ornament>
[5844] <ornament>Confidence correcting mind,</ornament>
[5845] <ornament>Measure caught by dream,</ornament>
[5846] <ornament>Through diligence sequence:</ornament>
[5847] <prose>Great: completely ceasing dreams,
Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.</prose>
[5848] <prose>Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
No conceptuality of good or bad latency.</prose>
[5849] <prose>Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency,
Need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.</prose>
[5850] <ornament>Thus the three abidings:</ornament>
[5851] <tantra>From the Mu tig phreng:</tantra>
[5852] <verse>Abiding is the pure expanse,</verse>
[5853] <verse>Thus abiding is awareness essence,</verse>
[5854] <verse>Abiding are all visions.</verse>
[5855] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5856] <ornament>Third, striking nails with three obtains:</ornament>
[5857] <prose>Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.</prose>
[5858] <prose>Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.</prose>
[5859] <prose>Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—</prose>
[5860] <prose>Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."</prose>
[5861] <tantra>Again from that itself:</tantra>
[5862] <verse>Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;</verse>
[5863] <verse>Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;</verse>
[5864] <verse>Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.</verse>
[5865] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5866] <ornament>Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:</ornament>
[5867] <prose>Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;</prose>
[5868] <prose>Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;</prose>
[5869] <prose>Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into samsara of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;</prose>
[5870] <prose>Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvana's self-place.</prose>
[5871] <tantra>From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:</tantra>
[5872] <verse>Through four great confidences of unchanging view,</verse>
[5873] <verse>Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.</verse>
[5874] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5875] <ornament>Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
Concluding gathering through sixteen visions:</ornament>
[5876] <list>Vision,</list>
[5877] <list>Increase,</list>
[5878] <list>Obtain,</list>
[5879] <list>Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,</list>
[5880] <prose>Completing the sixteen-ground vision:</prose>
[5881] <prose>Dharmata manifest vision: increase is eye;</prose>
[5882] <prose>Near increase: eye's that itself;</prose>
[5883] <prose>Obtain: seeing nadi;</prose>
[5884] <prose>Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.</prose>
[5885] <prose>Experience increase vision: increase is light;</prose>
[5886] <prose>Near increase: bindu;</prose>
[5887] <prose>Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;</prose>
[5888] <prose>Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.</prose>
[5889] <prose>Measure-arrive vision: increase is kaya;</prose>
[5890] <prose>Near increase: vision as father-mother;</prose>
[5891] <prose>Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;</prose>
[5892] <prose>Near obtain: mandala complete.</prose>
[5893] <prose>Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in kaya and wisdom;</prose>
[5894] <prose>Near increase: empty without focus;</prose>
[5895] <prose>Obtain: inexpressible;</prose>
[5896] <prose>Near obtain: dharmata not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.</prose>
[5897] <prose>Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions,
Having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,</prose>
[5898] <prose>Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."</prose>
[5899] <prose>Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result,
Complete here in freeing as light-body and</prose>
[5900] <prose>Freeing in the bardo.</prose>
[5901] <tantra>From the Rig pa rang shar:</tantra>
[5902] <verse>"Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.</verse>
[5903] <verse>In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.</verse>
[5904] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5905] <prose>That also: that person to whom introduction is shown—</prose>
