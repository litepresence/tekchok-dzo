[11322] <ornament> To nirvāṇa possessing the method,
[11323] <ornament> That contaminated remainder,
[11324] <ornament> Aggregates' trace burned and purified—
[11325] <ornament> To that kāya, two:
[11326] <list> The Peaceful Kāya and the Wrathful Kāya.
[11327] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[11328] <verse> Kāya forms, two exist,
[11329] <verse> Peaceful and wrathful, thus spoken.
[11330] <verse> The wrathful thus-gone
[11331] <verse> The peaceful cannot empower emanation.
[11332] <prose><tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11333] <verse> Kāya also two:
[11334] <verse> The Peaceful Kāya and the Wrathful Kāya.
[11335] Continuum: two from essence-cause—all beings, primordially abiding as clear-light kāya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows the manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.
[11336] Latency exists, not-yet-ripened nature;
[11337] Manifest ripened, appearing as relics.
[11338] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[11339] <verse> Beings, primordially,
[11340] <verse> Dwelling in their own great ground,
[11341] <verse> By the distinction of ripened and not-yet-ripened,
[11342] <verse> Manifest and latency.
[11343] Place: greatly arising from head or spine, though also from elsewhere. Here the clear-light-familiar arising-kāya is shown as arising from those two.
[11344] <prose><tantra> From the Blazing Relics:
[11345] <verse> Likewise kāya from head,
[11346] <verse> Or from the joints of the spine.
[11347] Result: the rank of obtaining liberation.
[11348] That peaceful and wrathful both arising, consciousness dissolves into sky. At the time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, one liberates without the reality-bardo, attaining buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is the future part separate from this support.
[11349] If the peaceful kāya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberating in samādhi's five days.
[11350] Samādhi days are called "concentration-ground portion"—yogins have long and short differences.
[11351] If the wrathful kāya arises, from the eye arises Vajrasattva's nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberating in five instant-parts.
[11352] <prose><tantra> Thus from the Blazing Relics:
[11353] <verse> If both arise,
[11354] <verse> This one without bardo,
[11355] <verse> Essence primordially-pure great,
[11356] <verse> This one becomes possessing confidence.
[11357] <verse> Five days see truth,
[11358] <verse> That also dissolves into buddha.
[11359] <verse> If wrathful kāya arises,
[11360] <verse> This in reality-bardo,
[11361] <verse> In five instant-parts,
[11362] <verse> Liberates, O Ḍākinī.
[11363] <prose><tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11364] <verse> If peaceful kāya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation-kāya.
[11365] <verse> If wrathful kāya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation-kāya.
[11366] That peaceful kāya arising delivers the clear-light path, liberating through transparent-penetration into the primordially-pure ground—own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordial purity separates that emanation-appearance; it is not the ground for own-appearance emanation arising.
[11367] However, other-appearance is the basis for Saṃbhogakāya-Nirmāṇakāya arising; other-benefit activity arises depending on that, though know that primordial purity lacks the actual emanation-appearance portion.
[11368] That wrathful kāya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance—at liberation time, spontaneously-accomplished ground-appearance arises, remaining for a moment.
[11369] Through remaining for a moment in the arising of spontaneously-accomplished ground-appearance,
[11370] Upon completing twenty-one days of samādhi,
[11371] Through the gate of impure own-appearance, saṃsāra appears as the six classes of beings.
[11372] Through the gate of purity, the emanation-kāya emanates, taming whatever and benefiting.
[11373] Like illusion benefiting illusion,
[11374] Own-appearance benefits through own-appearance.
[11375] What need for liberation before emanating emanations?
[11376] For if self is not liberated, since self-benefit is not complete, there is no occasion for other-benefit to arise.
[11377] That emanation is only like a shooting star's swift passage,
[11378] Explained as uncertain regarding long or short duration.
[11379] Confusing able and unable to emit emanations,
[11380] Many focus their minds on whether Buddhas can or cannot benefit others.
[11381] This is a great error.
[11382] Buddhas that do not benefit are not desired in the Great Vehicle and are impossible in reality.
[11383] Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent-penetration, where spontaneously-accomplished doors of the bardo arise without delay, have no emanations,
[11384] For the impure field of emanation does not appear at that time.
[11385] From the spontaneously-accomplished door appearing, the impure appears.
[11386] If emanation does not benefit there,
[11387] Since the appearance of saṃsāra has not set, to complete the incomplete Buddha-activity of own-appearance, emanation appears to unfold.
[11388] Having benefited through that, emptying saṃsāra, again that emanation-appearance goes to the ground of primordial purity, dissolving within the eight spontaneously-accomplished doors.
[11389] That primordially-pure ground, beyond appearing and not-appearing, is without actual difference of individual three kāyas from merely the basis of arising of the three kāyas.
[11390] From that, know the way other-benefit arises again in ground-appearance.
[11391] This place is the supreme difficulty, the great secret vajra seal.
[11392] If from now on one arises who can speak without error, know it to be through my power.
[11393] Second, the extensive explanation of relics has three parts:
[11394] <list> Brief showing by common division,
[11395] <list> Extensive explanation by special division,
[11396] <list> Concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels.
[11397] Of the first:
[11398] Generally, all beings are Buddhas primordially, dwelling as the five wisdom-natures individually and not-individually, five relics not-yet-ripened as latency existing for holding that kāya-race and life. The yogin trains the clear-light essence-path, ripening manifestly.
[11399] Five ringsels and so forth arising, liberating race separately.
[11400] <prose><tantra> From the Blazing Relics:
[11401] <verse> To supreme person, nirvāṇa,
[11402] <verse> All Buddhas' relics arise.
[11403] <verse> From Buddha-race distinction,
[11404] <verse> Relics' race five-five arise.
[11405] <verse> Ringsel thus-gone relics,
[11406] <verse> Likewise called ringsel,
[11407] <verse> Is vajra-race relics.
[11408] <verse> Ringsel jewel,
[11409] <verse> Ringsel lotus,
[11410] <verse> Likewise called ringsel,
[11411] <verse> Is action-race relics.
[11412] That also: from five relics' races to the person, whatever arises—one or all complete—to the five-race mass appearance, relics' race is the sign of liberating as that Buddha.
[11413] <prose><tantra> From that:
[11414] <verse> Method-possessing nirvāṇa,
[11415] <verse> Body—all this arises.
[11416] <verse> If individual race relics arise,
[11417] <verse> Also in reality-bardo,
[11418] <verse> See Buddha of individual race,
[11419] <verse> Liberate.
[11420] <prose><tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11421] <verse> Relics also five:
[11422] <verse> Dark-blue color, Vairocana field, complete Buddha;
[11423] <verse> White color, Vajrasattva;
[11424] <verse> Yellow color, Ratnasambhava;
[11425] <verse> Red color, Amitābha;
[11426] <verse> Green color, Amoghasiddhi;
[11427] <verse> Various colors, reached ground of spontaneously-accomplishing five kāyas.
[11428] Second, special division—color of five relics' races, measure of big-small, distinction of place, from what cause arises—four.
[11429] First, color: five possessing portions of five races. That also peaceful relics' color and wrathful relics' color arise as two portions.
[11430] Peaceful color, spoken in the Blazing Relics:
[11431] <verse> Ringsel white,
[11432] <verse> Ringsel blue-black,
[11433] <verse> Ringsel yellow,
[11434] <verse> Ringsel red,
[11435] <verse> Ringsel green.
[11436] In the Self-Arisen, wrathful relics' color spoken:
[11437] That race shown thus:
[11438] <verse> Ringsel white luster,
[11439] <verse> Ringsel blue-black,
[11440] <verse> Ringsel possessing heat, yellow,
[11441] <verse> Ringsel dark-blue,
[11442] <verse> Ringsel red-green-black—
[11443] <verse> Likewise color division.
[11444] <verse> From the Blazing Relic,
[11445] To the supreme being who attained nirvāṇa,
[11446] <verse> All buddhas' relics also arise;
[11447] <verse> From the distinction of the buddha families,
[11448] <verse> The relic races arise as five-by-five.
[11449] <verse> Śarīraṃ is the bliss-gone relic;
[11450] <verse> Likewise parīraṃ is called
[11451] <verse> The vajra family's relic.
[11452] <verse> Curīraṃ is the jewel;
[11453] <verse> Berīraṃ is the lotus;
[11454] <verse> Likewise ñarīraṃ is called
[11455] <verse> The karma family's relic.
[11456] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[11457] <verse> That also, for the person from whom relic races five
[11458] One or all complete whatever arises, to the five-family mass appearance,
[11459] The relic race's buddhahood liberation is the sign.
[11460] <verse> From that itself:
[11461] <verse> "The method-possessor who attained nirvāṇa,
[11462] <verse> In the body all these arise;
[11463] <verse> Individual family relics arising,
[11464] <verse> In the dharmatā intermediate state also,
[11465] <verse> Individual individual family's buddha's
[11466] <verse> Kāya seeing and liberating."
[11467] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[11468] From the Vajrasattva Heart Mirror:
[11469] Regarding relics also five:
[11470] Dark-blue color is Vairocana's field perfectly completely awakened.
[11471] <verse> White color is Vajrasattva's.
[11472] Yellow color is Ratnasambhava's.
[11473] Red color is Amitābha's.
[11474] <verse> Green color is Amoghasiddhi's.
[11475] Variegated color is the spontaneously accomplished five-kāya ground arrived at.
[11476] <verse> Second, regarding the distinction of divisions—the relic races' colors,
[11477] Big-small measure,
[11478] Place distinction,
[11479] Cause from what arises—four.
