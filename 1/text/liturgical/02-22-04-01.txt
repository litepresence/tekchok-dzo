<ornament> [11322] To nirvāṇa possessing the method,
<ornament> [11323] That contaminated remainder,
<ornament> [11324] Aggregates' trace burned and purified—
<ornament> [11325] To that kāya, two:
<list> [11326] The Peaceful Kāya and the Wrathful Kāya.

<tantra> [11327] From the Self-Arisen:
<verse> [11328] Kāya forms, two exist,
<verse> [11329] Peaceful and wrathful, thus spoken.
<verse> [11330] The wrathful thus-gone
<verse> [11331] The peaceful cannot empower emanation.

<tantra> [11332] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
<verse> [11333] Kāya also two:
<verse> [11334] The Peaceful Kāya and the Wrathful Kāya.

[11335] Continuum: two from essence-cause—all beings, primordially abiding as clear-light kāya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows the manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.

[11336] Latency exists, not-yet-ripened nature;

[11337] Manifest ripened, appearing as relics.

<tantra> [11338] From the Self-Arisen:
<verse> [11339] Beings, primordially,
<verse> [11340] Dwelling in their own great ground,
<verse> [11341] By the distinction of ripened and not-yet-ripened,
<verse> [11342] Manifest and latency.

[11343] Place: greatly arising from head or spine, though also from elsewhere. Here the clear-light-familiar arising-kāya is shown as arising from those two.

<tantra> [11344] From the Blazing Relics:
<verse> [11345] Likewise kāya from head,
<verse> [11346] Or from the joints of the spine.

[11347] Result: the rank of obtaining liberation.

[11348] That peaceful and wrathful both arising, consciousness dissolves into sky. At the time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, one liberates without the reality-bardo, attaining buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is the future part separate from this support.

[11349] If the peaceful kāya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberating in samādhi's five days.

[11350] Samādhi days are called "concentration-ground portion"—yogins have long and short differences.

[11351] If the wrathful kāya arises, from the eye arises Vajrasattva's nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberating in five instant-parts.

<tantra> [11352] Thus from the Blazing Relics:
<verse> [11353] If both arise,
<verse> [11354] This one without bardo,
<verse> [11355] Essence primordially-pure great,
<verse> [11356] This one becomes possessing confidence.
<verse> [11357] Five days see truth,
<verse> [11358] That also dissolves into buddha.
<verse> [11359] If wrathful kāya arises,
<verse> [11360] This in reality-bardo,
<verse> [11361] In five instant-parts,
<verse> [11362] Liberates, O Ḍākinī.

<tantra> [11363] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
<verse> [11364] If peaceful kāya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation-kāya.
<verse> [11365] If wrathful kāya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation-kāya.

[11366] That peaceful kāya arising delivers the clear-light path, liberating through transparent-penetration into the primordially-pure ground—own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordial purity separates that emanation-appearance; it is not the ground for own-appearance emanation arising.

[11367] However, other-appearance is the basis for Saṃbhogakāya-Nirmāṇakāya arising; other-benefit activity arises depending on that, though know that primordial purity lacks the actual emanation-appearance portion.

[11368] That wrathful kāya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance—at liberation time, spontaneously-accomplished ground-appearance arises, remaining for a moment.

[11369] Through remaining for a moment in the arising of spontaneously-accomplished ground-appearance,

[11370] Upon completing twenty-one days of samādhi,

[11371] Through the gate of impure own-appearance, saṃsāra appears as the six classes of beings.

[11372] Through the gate of purity, the emanation-kāya emanates, taming whatever and benefiting.

[11373] Like illusion benefiting illusion,

[11374] Own-appearance benefits through own-appearance.

[11375] What need for liberation before emanating emanations?

[11376] For if self is not liberated, since self-benefit is not complete, there is no occasion for other-benefit to arise.

[11377] That emanation is only like a shooting star's swift passage,

[11378] Explained as uncertain regarding long or short duration.

[11379] Confusing able and unable to emit emanations,

[11380] Many focus their minds on whether Buddhas can or cannot benefit others.

[11381] This is a great error.

[11382] Buddhas that do not benefit are not desired in the Great Vehicle and are impossible in reality.

[11383] Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent-penetration, where spontaneously-accomplished doors of the bardo arise without delay, have no emanations,

[11384] For the impure field of emanation does not appear at that time.

[11385] From the spontaneously-accomplished door appearing, the impure appears.

[11386] If emanation does not benefit there,

[11387] Since the appearance of saṃsāra has not set, to complete the incomplete Buddha-activity of own-appearance, emanation appears to unfold.

[11388] Having benefited through that, emptying saṃsāra, again that emanation-appearance goes to the ground of primordial purity, dissolving within the eight spontaneously-accomplished doors.

[11389] That primordially-pure ground, beyond appearing and not-appearing, is without actual difference of individual three kāyas from merely the basis of arising of the three kāyas.

[11390] From that, know the way other-benefit arises again in ground-appearance.

[11391] This place is the supreme difficulty, the great secret vajra seal.

[11392] If from now on one arises who can speak without error, know it to be through my power.

[11393] Second, the extensive explanation of relics has three parts:

<list> [11394] Brief showing by common division,
<list> [11395] Extensive explanation by special division,
<list> [11396] Concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels.

[11397] Of the first:

[11398] Generally, all beings are Buddhas primordially, dwelling as the five wisdom-natures individually and not-individually, five relics not-yet-ripened as latency existing for holding that kāya-race and life. The yogin trains the clear-light essence-path, ripening manifestly.

[11399] Five ringsels and so forth arising, liberating race separately.

<tantra> [11400] From the Blazing Relics:
<verse> [11401] To supreme person, nirvāṇa,
<verse> [11402] All Buddhas' relics arise.
<verse> [11403] From Buddha-race distinction,
<verse> [11404] Relics' race five-five arise.
<verse> [11405] Ringsel thus-gone relics,
<verse> [11406] Likewise called ringsel,
<verse> [11407] Is vajra-race relics.
<verse> [11408] Ringsel jewel,
<verse> [11409] Ringsel lotus,
<verse> [11410] Likewise called ringsel,
<verse> [11411] Is action-race relics.

[11412] That also: from five relics' races to the person, whatever arises—one or all complete—to the five-race mass appearance, relics' race is the sign of liberating as that Buddha.

<tantra> [11413] From that:
<verse> [11414] Method-possessing nirvāṇa,
<verse> [11415] Body—all this arises.
<verse> [11416] If individual race relics arise,
<verse> [11417] Also in reality-bardo,
<verse> [11418] See Buddha of individual race,
<verse> [11419] Liberate.

<tantra> [11420] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
<verse> [11421] Relics also five:
<verse> [11422] Dark-blue color, Vairocana field, complete Buddha;
<verse> [11423] White color, Vajrasattva;
<verse> [11424] Yellow color, Ratnasambhava;
<verse> [11425] Red color, Amitābha;
<verse> [11426] Green color, Amoghasiddhi;
<verse> [11427] Various colors, reached ground of spontaneously-accomplishing five kāyas.

[11428] Second, special division—color of five relics' races, measure of big-small, distinction of place, from what cause arises—four.

[11429] First, color: five possessing portions of five races. That also peaceful relics' color and wrathful relics' color arise as two portions.

[11430] Peaceful color, spoken in the Blazing Relics:

<verse> [11431] Ringsel white,
<verse> [11432] Ringsel blue-black,
<verse> [11433] Ringsel yellow,
<verse> [11434] Ringsel red,
<verse> [11435] Ringsel green.

[11436] In the Self-Arisen, wrathful relics' color spoken:

[11437] That race shown thus:

<verse> [11438] Ringsel white luster,
<verse> [11439] Ringsel blue-black,
<verse> [11440] Ringsel possessing heat, yellow,
<verse> [11441] Ringsel dark-blue,
<verse> [11442] Ringsel red-green-black—
<verse> [11443] Likewise color division.

[11444] <verse> From the Blazing Relic,
[11445] To the supreme being who attained nirvāṇa,
[11446] <verse> All buddhas' relics also arise;
[11447] <verse> From the distinction of the buddha families,
[11448] <verse> The relic races arise as five-by-five.
[11449] <verse> Śarīraṃ is the bliss-gone relic;
[11450] <verse> Likewise parīraṃ is called
[11451] <verse> The vajra family's relic.
[11452] <verse> Curīraṃ is the jewel;
[11453] <verse> Berīraṃ is the lotus;
[11454] <verse> Likewise ñarīraṃ is called
[11455] <verse> The karma family's relic.
[11456] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[11457] <verse> That also, for the person from whom relic races five
[11458] One or all complete whatever arises, to the five-family mass appearance,
[11459] The relic race's buddhahood liberation is the sign.
[11460] <verse> From that itself:
[11461] <verse> "The method-possessor who attained nirvāṇa,
[11462] <verse> In the body all these arise;
[11463] <verse> Individual family relics arising,
[11464] <verse> In the dharmatā intermediate state also,
[11465] <verse> Individual individual family's buddha's
[11466] <verse> Kāya seeing and liberating."
[11467] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[11468] From the Vajrasattva Heart Mirror:
[11469] Regarding relics also five:
[11470] Dark-blue color is Vairocana's field perfectly completely awakened.
[11471] <verse> White color is Vajrasattva's.
[11472] Yellow color is Ratnasambhava's.
[11473] Red color is Amitābha's.
[11474] <verse> Green color is Amoghasiddhi's.
[11475] Variegated color is the spontaneously accomplished five-kāya ground arrived at.
[11476] <verse> Second, regarding the distinction of divisions—the relic races' colors,
[11477] Big-small measure,
[11478] Place distinction,
[11479] Cause from what arises—four.
