[11322] To race-possessing nirvana,
[11323] That remainder contaminated,
[11324] Aggregates' trace burned purified,
[11325] To that kaya two—
[11326] Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.
[11327] From Self-Arisen:
[11328] Kaya form two exist,
[11329] Peaceful and wrathful said,
[11330] Wrathful thus-gone,
[11331] Peaceful cannot power emanation.
[11332] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11333] Kaya also two,
[11334] Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.
[11335] Continuum: two from essence cause—all beings primordial clear-light kaya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.
[11336] Latency exists, not-ripe nature;
[11337] Manifest ripe, appearing as relics.
[11338] From former:
[11339] Beings primordial,
[11340] Self-place great ground dwell,
[11341] By ripe not-ripe distinction,
[11342] Manifest and latency.
[11343] Place: much arising from head or spine, though also from other. Here clear-light familiar arising kaya shown arising from those two.
[11344] From Blazing Relics:
[11345] Likewise kaya from head,
[11346] Or from spine vertebrae joint.
[11347] Result: rank of obtaining liberation.

[11354] 
[11355]

[11357] 
[11358] 
[11359] 
[11360] 
[11361]

[11376] 
[11377] 
[11378] 
[11379] 
[11380] That peaceful-wrathful both arise, consciousness dissolves into sky. At time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, liberate without reality bardo, buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is future part separate from this support.
[11381] If peaceful kaya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberates in samadhi five days.
[11382] Samadhi days called concentration ground part—yogins have long-short difference.
[11383] If wrathful kaya arises, from eye arises Vajrasattva nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberates in five instant parts.
[11384] Thus from Blazing Relics:
[11385] If both arise,
[11386] This without bardo,
[11387] Essence primordially-pure great,
[11388] This becomes possessing confidence.
[11389] Five days see truth,
[11390] That also dissolves into buddha.
[11391] If wrathful kaya arises,
[11392] This in reality bardo,
[11393] In five instant parts,
[11394] Liberates, dakini.
[11395] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11396] If peaceful kaya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation kaya.
[11397] If wrathful kaya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation kaya.
[11398] That peaceful kaya arising, delivering clear-light path, liberating transparent-penetrate into primordially-pure ground, own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordially-pure separates that emanation appearance, not ground for own-appearance emanation arising.
[11399] However, other-appearance is basis for sambhogakaya-nirmanakaya arising, other benefit activity arises depending on that, though know primordially-pure lacks actual emanation appearance portion.
[11400] That wrathful kaya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance, at liberation time, spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance arises, stays a moment.
[11401] 
[11402] 
[11403] 
[11404] 
[11405] 
[11406] 
[11407] 
[11408] 
[11409] 
[11410] 
[11411] 
[11412] Through remaining for a moment in the arising of spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance,
[11413] Upon completing twenty-one days of samādhi,
[11414] Through the gate of impure own-appearance, saṃsāra appears as the six classes of beings.
[11415] Through the gate of purity, the emanation kāya emanates, taming whatever and benefiting.
[11416] Like illusion benefiting illusion,
[11417] Own-appearance benefits through own-appearance.
[11418] What need for liberation before emanating emanations?
[11419] For if self is not liberated, since self-benefit is not complete, there is no occasion for other-benefit to arise.
[11420] That emanation is only like a shooting star running,
[11421] Explained as uncertain regarding long or short duration.
[11422] Confusing able and unable to emit emanations,
[11423] Many focus their minds on whether buddhas can or cannot benefit others.
[11424] This is a great error.
[11425] Buddhas that do not benefit are not desired in the Great Vehicle and are impossible in reality.
[11426] Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent penetration, where spontaneously accomplished doors of the bardo arise without delay, have no emanations,
[11427] For the impure field of emanation does not appear at that time.
[11428] From the spontaneously accomplished door appearing, the impure appears.
[11429] If emanation does not benefit there,
[11430] Since the appearance of saṃsāra has not set, to complete the incomplete buddha activity of own-appearance, emanation appears to open.
[11431] Having benefited through that, emptying saṃsāra, again that emanation appearance goes to the ground of primordial purity, dissolving within the eight spontaneously accomplished doors.
[11432] That primordially pure ground, beyond appearing and not appearing, is without actual difference of individual three kāyas from merely the basis of arising of the three kāyas.
[11433] From that, know the way other-benefit arises again in ground-appearance.
[11434] This place is the supreme difficulty, the great secret vajra seal.
[11435] If from now on one arises who can speak without error, know it to be through my power.
[11436] Second, the extensive explanation of relics has three parts.
[11437] Brief show by common division,
[11438] Extensive explanation by special division,
[11439] Concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels.
[11440] Of the first:
[11441] Generally all beings buddhas primordially, dwell as wisdom five nature individually and not individually, five relics not ripe as latency existing for holding that kaya race and life. Yogin trains clear-light essence path, ripens manifestly.
[11442] Five ringsel etcetera arising, liberating race separately.
[11443] From Blazing Relics:
[11444] To supreme person nirvana,
[11445] All buddhas' relics arise.
[11446] From buddha race distinction,
[11447] Relics race five-five arise.
[11448] Ringsel thus-gone relics,
[11449] Likewise called ringsel,
[11450] Is vajra race relics.
[11451] Ringsel jewel,
[11452] Ringsel lotus,
[11453] Likewise called ringsel,
[11454] Is action race relics.
[11455] That also: from five relics races to person, whatever arises one or all complete, to five race mass appearance, relics race is sign of liberating as that buddha.
[11456] From that:
[11457] Method-possess nirvana,
[11458] Body this all arises.
[11459] If individual race relics arise,
[11460] Also in reality bardo,
[11461] See buddha of individual race,
[11462] Liberate.
[11463] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11464] Relics also five:
[11465] Dark-blue color, Vairocana field complete buddha;
[11466] White color, Vajrasattva;
[11467] Yellow color, Ratnasambhava;
[11468] Red color, Amitabha;
[11469] Green color, Amoghasiddhi;
[11470] Various colors, reached ground of spontaneously accomplishing five kayas.
[11471] Second, special division—color of five relics races, measure of big-small, distinction of place, from what cause arises—four.
[11472] 
[11473] 
[11474] 
[11475] 
[11476] 
[11477] First color: five possessing portions of five races. That also peaceful relics color and wrathful relics color arise as two portions.
[11478] Peaceful color said in Blazing Relics:
[11479] Ringsel white,
