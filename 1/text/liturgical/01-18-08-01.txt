[4950] Thus it is spoken.
[4951] Thus explained and heard,
[4953] Vajra-holder,
[4954] Vajrasattva visualized:
[4955] Dharma light-rays pervading sky, emanated—
[4956] Beings in fields of dust-count hear,
[4957] Ignorance's sleep is awakened,
[4958] Wisdom's meaning obtained,
[4959] Liberation's path entered.
[4960] Word-meaning's abode realized, meditating:
[4961] Listeners, heroes of the lineage, and
[4962] Mind-consorts,
[4963] Knowing dakinis' appearance—
[4964] Practicing mind's sublime clear light, realized, focused:

[4977] THIRD TOPIC: ARISEN-BASIS LETTERS' SOUND AND MEANING EXPLAINED—two:
[4978] Letter-cloud's nature generally shown, and
[4979] Abode-definite specifically explained.
[4980] First has four:
[4981] 1. Abode-nature-meaning's letter
[4982] 2. Body-abode-channel's letter
[4983] 3. Expression-sound's letter
[4984] 4. Result's ultimate letter
[4985] First:
[4986] Mind-nature, naturally clear light, self-arisen wisdom—transcending eternalism and nihilism, coming and going—is the nature.
[4987] Called "letter of sphere-ultimate reality,"
[4988] From the Secret Essence of Magical Display:
[4989] Mind-nature is letter's nature—
[4990] Letter: wish-fulfilling jewel cloud.
[4991] Thus.
[4992] Second:
[4993] In the body's four channel-wheels' center, within the three heart-channels existing as three pillars—
[4994] OM AH HŪṂ: these self-arisen letters three, colors white-red-blue three, abiding—
[4995] OUTER: body, speech, mind—three.
[4996] INNER: afflictions, poisons—three.
[4997] SECRET: body, speech, mind—three's support.
[4998] With light-rays five's radiance existing:
[4999] In wheels four's channel-petals: father, mother, method, wisdom's letters: vowel letters sixteen and
[5000] Consonants—
[5001] Thirty-four:
[5002] Singles,
[5003] Doubles,
[5004] Prefixes,
[5005] Through branch divisions: all eighty-four thousand abiding.
[5006] OUTER: body's aggregates, elements, sense-fields' support.
[5007] Cause of speech and expression arising.
[5008] INNER: afflictions, thought-collections, eighty-four thousand's support.
[5009] Day and night, conceptions many arisen, support doing.
[5010] Secret: when pure, Dharma's gates that many arising, support doing.
[5011] That also: each consonant with vowel letters sixteen's sound nearby abiding.
[5012] Letter's form also that's sound whatever arisen, stacked—for example:
[5013] KA KĀ—
[5014] Within, life A existing: called A Ā.
[5015] From Symbolic Expression:
[5016] A is all letters' supreme—
[5017] Within, arisen, birthless.
[5018] Thus:
[5019] KI KĪ is Ī.
[5020] KU KŪ is Ū.
[5021] KE KAI is E AI.
[5022] KO KAU is O AU.
[5023] KRA KRA is RA RA.
[5024] RI RĪ and LI LĪ: life A existing, KI KĪ gathered—
[5025] AṂ AḤ is KAṂ KAḤ called.
[5026] Those root letters: double-stacked KKA said is great.
[5027] GHA JHA DHA BHA: said like thick.
[5028] Triple-stacked and five-stacked, etc.:
[5029] Called "sphere's single letter."
[5030] Suitable ones read as one.
[5031] Unsuitable ones read separately.
[5032] Channels in thus existing: body, speech, mind, wisdom five, etc., in different spheres.
[5033] Letters and similar: light five's appearance having—just brush-strokes, essence white-red, in wind's center, self-clear existing.
[5034] Now: the clear root letters—
