[1902] The presentation of mistaken vehicles is thus:
[1903] These proponents hold the three hundred sixty components of the conditioned collection.
[1904] This category has two principal aspects:
<list> [1905] First: the generally taught self-nature of eternalism and nihilism—the two extreme views;
<list> [1906] Second: specifically explained as the enumerated types that branch from these.
[1907] Regarding the first, these two extremes:
<list> [1908] The eternalist view, asserting permanent existence;
<list> [1909] And the nihilist view, asserting complete non-existence.
[1910] First, regarding eternalism: although the non-Buddhist Tīrthika traditions hold many various views,
[1911] The Sāṃkhyas, who propound eternalism regarding causes, are foremost among all these doctrines.
[1912] Their principal tenet is first explained as follows:
[1913] They speak of the "dust of darkness"—the fundamental matter in its unmanifest state.
[1914] The essence of the three equal portions of potency—desire, hatred, and delusion in equilibrium—is called the "self" or purusha.
[1915] They hold that in the hearts of all embodied beings, there exist forms of this self corresponding to the size of a thumb.
[1916] In large-bodied beings, the self is the size of a thumb.
[1917] In smaller beings, it abides within sesame pods.
[1918] In even smaller creatures, it is like sesame grains, and so forth down to the subtlest forms.
[1919] This self is white in color,
[1920] Oily in texture,
[1921] Coiled in shape,
[1922] Without breaking or destruction,
[1923] Existing hiddenly within the body as the eternal self that ordinary eyes cannot see.
[1924] Now, the essence of this "dust of darkness"—the unmanifest matter—is explained:
[1925] At the time when desire, hatred, and delusion are equal in three portions in the fundamental matter,
[1926] The self-nature knows itself through awareness,
[1927] Yet does not see the self-nature through ordinary perception.
[1928] Later, at the time of liberation,
[1929] The self manifests at the top of the heavens, appearing like a white umbrella completely surrounded, displaying the color and form of liberation.
[1930] Now, regarding the self-nature of that: the essence is without movement or change.
[1931] It is free from all action and activity.
[1932] It possesses deep knowing of objects through awareness.
[1933] Since this self-nature existing eternally throughout time is not known by sentient beings, they remain in saṃsāra.
[1934] Knowing that essence without distraction, one is liberated. By practicing well the sacrifices and offerings in this life,
[1935] One is born into the complete enjoyment of one's retinue and power in the higher god realms.
[1936] From this fundamental doctrine, the Sāṃkhya tradition branched into many individual traditions.
[1937] These entered from various understandings:
[1938] Some held the self as not the consumer of experience, the eternal entity, the agent;
[1939] Some were examined by the Sāṃkhyas as without qualities;
[1940] Based on these and other slight distinctions,
[1941] The traditions of the Tīrthikas became different from one another.
[1942] Thus the eternalist position is taught.
[1943] Now, regarding the propounders of nihilism:
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 57

<ornament>
[1944] The Lokāyata school holds as follows:
[1945] From the appearing of the realms of seeing, hearing, pleasure, and pain as they are manifest now,
[1946] Previous and future lives,
[1947] Actions, causes, and results,
[1948] And the existence of liberation and freedom—absolutely nothing at all is held to exist.
[1949] This nihilist position also has two divisions:
<list> [1950] The propounders of cause nihilism and result nihilism.
[1951] First, regarding cause nihilism:
[1952] Some, like the son of the naked ascetic, say that the mind of before is not this current mind.
[1953] They hold that there is a mind abiding by the self-nature of the four elements.
[1954] That mind, from the unmanifest compression of the elements,
[1955] When conditions of heat and moisture meet, the mind of latent self-nature arises.
[1956] Entering a new body with a new mind,
[1957] It becomes a sentient being.
[1958] They hold that this mind, abiding in the latent self-nature of earth, produces grass, trees, forests, and so forth.
[1959] Through water existing, it moistens, moves, and produces sound.
[1960] Through fire existing, it blazes and burns.
[1961] Through wind existing, movement arises—that is its essential nature.
[1962] Thus they hold:
<list> [1963] Wood, sticks,
<list> [1964] Pebbles,
<list> [1965] And all coarse material entities possess mind.
[1966] When one strikes one, sound arises as evidence.
[1967] When thrown, it goes for a reason, demonstrating awareness.
[1968] They cite that some trees wither at night and expand in the day.
[1969] When skin is peeled, it dries, showing response.
[1970] And for the sake of producing dried growth and so forth.
[1971] Thus, if there is previous action and mind in the realms,
[1972] Trees and so forth also become sentient from previous existence.
[1973] Not existing permanently—suddenly arising.
[1974] Like a boil arising from the gathering of current accumulations.
[1975] How does consciousness manifest?
[1976] From the meeting of summer heat and moisture, a small worm as long as a horse's tail goes in one direction.
[1977] What remains on the other side becomes a drum-tail insect.
[1978] Termites transform,
[1979] From insects become bees. It is known that worms become frogs.
[1980] Thus, they claim the cause is not eternal.
[1981] In summer, when termites enter wood, pebbles,
[1982] And awns of grain, they become sentient beings through transformation.

<ornament>
[1983] When adventitious causes and conditions gather, the result becomes a sentient being.
[1984] Also, from good causes and conditions, good results are accomplished.
[1985] Like when a king's daughter is seen to arise from beautiful queens. Thus this position is held.
[1986] Second, regarding the propounder of severance of results:
[1987] The followers of the son of Katika with a hunchback,
[1988] And others like Mipam wearing a hair blanket.
[1989] For present beings, they hold there is not only no previous life,
[1990] But also no latent cause producing the arising mind.
[1991] It is merely the spontaneous arising of nature itself.
[1992] Without any maker, sharp thorns exist,
[1993] The sun arises and rises naturally.
[1994] Water falls from waterfalls—not from causes, but naturally formed, primordially arising.
[1995] Dying without continuation, the next life's result is absolutely nonexistent. Thus this position is held.
[1996] From the Black Tantra of Ishvara, they cite:
<tantra> [1997] "The sun rises, rivers fall,
<tantra> [1998] Sharp, long thorns grow,
<tantra> [1999] Beautiful peacocks' tails display,
<tantra> [2000] Beautiful kings' sons are born—
<tantra> [2001] None made these; they arise from nature itself.
<tantra> [2002] Cessation is not nonexistent, nor is the future existent.
<tantra> [2003] All this is merely adventitious confusion, conceptually designated."
[2004] Thus it is taught in their scriptures.
[2005] When refuted that such scripture becomes meaningless,
[2006] The answer they give is also this:
[2007] On the side of those propounding cause severance:
[2008] Without a previous mind existing, the present coarse arising mind exists, and when it ripens as a sentient being here,
[2009] Without habituating the nonexistent nature, later from death, the four elements' latents also,
[2010] If the mind does not enter liberation, the scripture's meaning exists for them.
[2011] Without habituating the nonexistent, at death, the body of four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—dissolves into the four elements of outer objects.
[2012] This knowledge also divides into four and destroys the nature of afflictions. Thus it is taught by them.
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 59

<ornament>
[2013] On the side of those propounding result severance:
[2014] If one knows the nonexistent nature, other scriptures do not carry one away.
[2015] Thus they avoid making meaningless effort.
[2016] To reverse this life's attachment, they say that the established scripture has meaning, though they speak of nonexistence.
[2017] Those two holders of positions, like the humpbacked son of Katika, hold:
[2018] All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements.
[2019] In the middle, they abide in the space of arising.
[2020] In the end, they dissolve into the space of arising, holding that there is no trace remaining.
[2021] They speak of the single space of arising as the self-nature of all phenomena.
[2022] In the space of abiding, the nine abodes of non-abiding arise as whatever appears.
[2023] From the space of arising, the nine non-arisings of the time of arising.
[2024] Outer forms and so forth—objects of various white and red colors.
[2025] Inner sentient beings and mental concepts.
[2026] Nine aspects of the body that do not arise differently.
[2027] At the time of liberation,
[2028] The nine unliberated, when liberated—all vessels, contents, and embodied forms dissolve themselves. Since there is no unliberation,
[2029] The destroyed cannot return to the three realms.
[2030] Thus, all beings first arise adventitiously from space.
[2031] Now they abide adventitiously in space.
[2032] In the end, they are liberated adventitiously into space and do not return.
[2033] Second, explaining those enumerations individually:
[2034] From Rigpa Rangshar, the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra:
<tantra> [2035] "Such is the mistaken vehicle:
<tantra> [2036] Holding the three hundred sixty of the transitory collection.
<tantra> [2037] Explained as the three hundred spaces of non-Buddhist views.
<tantra> [2038] Such are the sixty branches of wrong view:
<tantra> [2039] The mistaken speech of the Sāṃkhyas,
<tantra> [2040] The Vaiśeṣikas' own-cause theory,
<tantra> [2041] The great Kumaralabha and his followers,
<tantra> [2042] The scripture-holders of ear-followers,
<tantra> [2043] Relying on the secret five fires,
<tantra> [2044] Burning the body with fire, cloth, and sesame oil,
<tantra> [2045] The mistaken conduct of spear-tip asceticism,
<tantra> [2046] The asceticism of sacrifices and feasts,
<tantra> [2047] Making chariots of bodies and flesh rings,
<tantra> [2048] Entering the conduct of dogs,
<tantra> [2049] Likewise, the subtle ground of clairvoyance,
<tantra> [2050] The general appearance of Buddha's blessings they mistake,
<tantra> [2051] The mistaken ascetic conduct.
<tantra> [2052] Such are the views of permanence:
<tantra> [2053] Speaking of agents as causes,
<tantra> [2054] Carrying agents to the path,
<tantra> [2055] Indicating great permanent meanings,
<tantra> [2056] Speaking of the eternal unchanging,
<tantra> [2057] Speaking of permanence as occasion,
<tantra> [2058] Speaking of causes as permanent,
<tantra> [2059] Speaking of results as permanent,
<tantra> [2060] Relying on the path of permanence itself,
<tantra> [2061] Regarding conduct as permanent,
<tantra> [2062] The view of severance regarding permanent meaning as nonexistent,
<tantra> [2063] Likewise, the nature of permanence.
<tantra> [2064] Chiefly doing immeasurable mantras,
<tantra> [2065] Chiefly doing divination and prophecy,
<tantra> [2066] Chiefly doing subtle miracles,
<tantra> [2067] Prioritizing debate,
<tantra> [2068] And mistaken ascetic conduct.
<tantra> [2069] Attachment to this world,
<tantra> [2070] Grasping one's own actions,
<tantra> [2071] Becoming wearers of hair blankets,
<tantra> [2072] Wearing Mipam's cotton garments,
<tantra> [2073] Chiefly making hand symbols,
<tantra> [2074] Speaking of dependence on actions,
<tantra> [2075] Refuting others through reasoning,
<tantra> [2076] Speaking of the severance of causes,
<tantra> [2077] Speaking of complete severance as emptiness,
<tantra> [2078] The view of severance of causes and results,
<tantra> [2079] The view of severance of paths and wisdom,
<tantra> [2080] The great severance of eternity,
<tantra> [2081] The definite severance of paths and results,
<tantra> [2082] The view of severance through mistaken mind,
<tantra> [2083] The great severance of emptiness,
<tantra> [2084] Speaking secret Vedas,
<tantra> [2085] Tirthikas of similar wrongness,
<tantra> [2086] Tirthikas of manifest mind,
<tantra> [2087] Tirthikas of confused appearance and grasping,
<tantra> [2088] Tirthikas of producing anger,
<tantra> [2089] Tirthikas of activity and mind,
<tantra> [2090] Tirthikas of grasping meaningless things,
<tantra> [2091] Tirthikas of erroneous speech,
<tantra> [2092] Tirthikas of permanent meaning as nonexistent."
