[1902] The presentation of mistaken vehicles is thus:
[1903] These proponents hold the three hundred sixty components of the conditioned collection.
[1904] This category has two principal aspects:
<list> [1905] First: the generally taught self-nature of eternalism and nihilism—the two extreme views;
<list> [1906] Second: specifically explained as the enumerated types that branch from these.
[1907] Regarding the first, these two extremes:
<list> [1908] The eternalist view, asserting permanent existence;
<list> [1909] And the nihilist view, asserting complete non-existence.
[1910] First, regarding eternalism: although the non-Buddhist Tīrthika traditions hold many various views,
[1911] The Sāṃkhyas, who propound eternalism regarding causes, are foremost among all these doctrines.
[1912] Their principal tenet is first explained as follows:
[1913] They speak of the "dust of darkness"—the fundamental matter in its unmanifest state.
[1914] The essence of the three equal portions of potency—desire, hatred, and delusion in equilibrium—is called the "self" or purusha.
[1915] They hold that in the hearts of all embodied beings, there exist forms of this self corresponding to the size of a thumb.
[1916] In large-bodied beings, the self is the size of a thumb.
[1917] In smaller beings, it abides within sesame pods.
[1918] In even smaller creatures, it is like sesame grains, and so forth down to the subtlest forms.
[1919] This self is white in color,
[1920] Oily in texture,
[1921] Coiled in shape,
[1922] Without breaking or destruction,
[1923] Existing hiddenly within the body as the eternal self that ordinary eyes cannot see.
[1924] Now, the essence of this "dust of darkness"—the unmanifest matter—is explained:
[1925] At the time when desire, hatred, and delusion are equal in three portions in the fundamental matter,
[1926] The self-nature knows itself through awareness,
[1927] Yet does not see the self-nature through ordinary perception.
[1928] Later, at the time of liberation,
[1929] The self manifests at the top of the heavens, appearing like a white umbrella completely surrounded, displaying the color and form of liberation.
[1930] Now, regarding the self-nature of that: the essence is without movement or change.
[1931] It is free from all action and activity.
[1932] It possesses deep knowing of objects through awareness.
[1933] Since this self-nature existing eternally throughout time is not known by sentient beings, they remain in saṃsāra.
[1934] Knowing that essence without distraction, one is liberated. By practicing well the sacrifices and offerings in this life,
[1935] One is born into the complete enjoyment of one's retinue and power in the higher god realms.
[1936] From this fundamental doctrine, the Sāṃkhya tradition branched into many individual traditions.
[1937] These entered from various understandings:
[1938] Some held the self as not the consumer of experience, the eternal entity, the agent;
[1939] Some were examined by the Sāṃkhyas as without qualities;
[1940] Based on these and other slight distinctions,
[1941] The traditions of the Tīrthikas became different from one another.
[1942] Thus the eternalist position is taught.
[1943] Now, regarding the propounders of nihilism:
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 57

<ornament>
[1944] The Lokāyata school holds as follows:
[1945] From the appearing of the realms of seeing, hearing, pleasure, and pain as they are manifest now,
[1946] Previous and future lives,
[1947] Actions, causes, and results,
[1948] And the existence of liberation and freedom—absolutely nothing at all is held to exist.
[1949] This nihilist position also has two divisions:
<list> [1950] The propounders of cause nihilism and result nihilism.
[1951] First, regarding cause nihilism:
[1952] Some, like the son of the naked ascetic, say that the mind of before is not this current mind.
[1953] They hold that there is a mind abiding by the self-nature of the four elements.
[1954] That mind, from the unmanifest compression of the elements,
[1955] When conditions of heat and moisture meet, the mind of latent self-nature arises.
[1956] Entering a new body with a new mind,
[1957] It becomes a sentient being.
[1958] They hold that this mind, abiding in the latent self-nature of earth, produces grass, trees, forests, and so forth.
[1959] Through water existing, it moistens, moves, and produces sound.
[1960] Through fire existing, it blazes and burns.
[1961] Through wind existing, movement arises—that is its essential nature.
[1962] Thus they hold:
<list> [1963] Wood, sticks,
<list> [1964] Pebbles,
<list> [1965] And all coarse material entities possess mind.
[1966] When one strikes one, sound arises as evidence.
[1967] When thrown, it goes for a reason, demonstrating awareness.
[1968] They cite that some trees wither at night and expand in the day.
[1969] When skin is peeled, it dries, showing response.
[1970] And for the sake of producing dried growth and so forth.
[1971] Thus, if there is previous action and mind in the realms,
[1972] Trees and so forth also become sentient from previous existence.
[1973] Not existing permanently—suddenly arising.
[1974] Like a boil arising from the gathering of current accumulations.
[1975] How does consciousness manifest?
[1976] From the meeting of summer heat and moisture, a small worm as long as a horse's tail goes in one direction.
[1977] What remains on the other side becomes a drum-tail insect.
[1978] Termites transform,
[1979] From insects become bees. It is known that worms become frogs.
[1980] Thus, they claim the cause is not eternal.
[1981] In summer, when termites enter wood, pebbles,
[1982] And awns of grain, they become sentient beings through transformation.
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 58

<ornament>
[1983] When adventitious causes and conditions gather, the result becomes a sentient being.
[1984] Also, from good causes and conditions, good results are accomplished.
[1985] Like when a king's daughter is seen to arise from beautiful queens. Thus this position is held.
[1986] Second, regarding the propounder of severance of results:
[1987] The followers of the son of Katika with a hunchback,
[1988] And others like Mipam wearing a hair blanket.
[1989] For present beings, they hold there is not only no previous life,
[1990] But also no latent cause producing the arising mind.
[1991] It is merely the spontaneous arising of nature itself.
[1992] Without any maker, sharp thorns exist,
[1993] The sun arises and rises naturally.
[1994] Water falls from waterfalls—not from causes, but naturally formed, primordially arising.
[1995] Dying without continuation, the next life's result is absolutely nonexistent. Thus this position is held.
[1996] From the Black Tantra of Ishvara, they cite:
<tantra> [1997] "The sun rises, rivers fall,
<tantra> [1998] Sharp, long thorns grow,
<tantra> [1999] Beautiful peacocks' tails display,
<tantra> [2000] Beautiful kings' sons are born—
<tantra> [2001] None made these; they arise from nature itself.
<tantra> [2002] Cessation is not nonexistent, nor is the future existent.
<tantra> [2003] All this is merely adventitious confusion, conceptually designated."
[2004] Thus it is taught in their scriptures.
[2005] When refuted that such scripture becomes meaningless,
[2006] The answer they give is also this:
[2007] On the side of those propounding cause severance:
[2008] Without a previous mind existing, the present coarse arising mind exists, and when it ripens as a sentient being here,
[2009] Without habituating the nonexistent nature, later from death, the four elements' latents also,
[2010] If the mind does not enter liberation, the scripture's meaning exists for them.
[2011] Without habituating the nonexistent, at death, the body of four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—dissolves into the four elements of outer objects.
[2012] This knowledge also divides into four and destroys the nature of afflictions. Thus it is taught by them.
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 59

<ornament>
[2013] On the side of those propounding result severance:
[2014] If one knows the nonexistent nature, other scriptures do not carry one away.
[2015] Thus they avoid making meaningless effort.
[2016] To reverse this life's attachment, they say that the established scripture has meaning, though they speak of nonexistence.
[2017] Those two holders of positions, like the humpbacked son of Katika, hold:
[2018] All sentient beings first arise from the space of elements.
[2019] In the middle, they abide in the space of arising.
[2020] In the end, they dissolve into the space of arising, holding that there is no trace remaining.
[2021] They speak of the single space of arising as the self-nature of all phenomena.
[2022] In the space of abiding, the nine abodes of non-abiding arise as whatever appears.
[2023] From the space of arising, the nine non-arisings of the time of arising.
[2024] Outer forms and so forth—objects of various white and red colors.
[2025] Inner sentient beings and mental concepts.
[2026] Nine aspects of the body that do not arise differently.
[2027] At the time of liberation,
[2028] The nine unliberated, when liberated—all vessels, contents, and embodied forms dissolve themselves. Since there is no unliberation,
[2029] The destroyed cannot return to the three realms.
[2030] Thus, all beings first arise adventitiously from space.
[2031] Now they abide adventitiously in space.
[2032] In the end, they are liberated adventitiously into space and do not return.
[2033] Second, explaining those enumerations individually:
[2034] From Rigpa Rangshar, the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra:
<tantra> [2035] "Such is the mistaken vehicle:
<tantra> [2036] Holding the three hundred sixty of the transitory collection.
<tantra> [2037] Explained as the three hundred spaces of non-Buddhist views.
<tantra> [2038] Such are the sixty branches of wrong view:
<tantra> [2039] The mistaken speech of the Sāṃkhyas,
<tantra> [2040] The Vaiśeṣikas' own-cause theory,
<tantra> [2041] The great Kumaralabha and his followers,
<tantra> [2042] The scripture-holders of ear-followers,
<tantra> [2043] Relying on the secret five fires,

<tantra> [2045] The mistaken conduct of spear-tip asceticism,
<tantra> [2046] The asceticism of sacrifices and feasts,
<tantra> [2047] Making chariots of bodies and flesh rings,
<tantra> [2048] Entering the conduct of dogs,
<tantra> [2049] Likewise, the subtle ground of clairvoyance,
<tantra> [2050] The general appearance of Buddha's blessings they mistake,
<tantra> [2051] The mistaken ascetic conduct.
<tantra> [2052] Such are the views of permanence:
<tantra> [2053] Speaking of agents as causes,
<tantra> [2054] Carrying agents to the path,
<tantra> [2055] Indicating great permanent meanings,
<tantra> [2056] Speaking of the eternal unchanging,
<tantra> [2057] Speaking of permanence as occasion,
<tantra> [2058] Speaking of causes as permanent,
<tantra> [2059] Speaking of results as permanent,
<tantra> [2060] Relying on the path of permanence itself,
<tantra> [2061] Regarding conduct as permanent,
<tantra> [2062] The view of severance regarding permanent meaning as nonexistent,
<tantra> [2063] Likewise, the nature of permanence.
<tantra> [2064] Chiefly doing immeasurable mantras,
<tantra> [2065] Chiefly doing divination and prophecy,
<tantra> [2066] Chiefly doing subtle miracles,
<tantra> [2067] Prioritizing debate,
<tantra> [2068] And mistaken ascetic conduct.
<tantra> [2069] Attachment to this world,
<tantra> [2070] Grasping one's own actions,
<tantra> [2071] Becoming wearers of hair blankets,
<tantra> [2072] Wearing Mipam's cotton garments,
<tantra> [2073] Chiefly making hand symbols,
<tantra> [2074] Speaking of dependence on actions,
<tantra> [2075] Refuting others through reasoning,
<tantra> [2076] Speaking of the severance of causes,
<tantra> [2077] Speaking of complete severance as emptiness,
<tantra> [2078] The view of severance of causes and results,
<tantra> [2079] The view of severance of paths and wisdom,
<tantra> [2080] The great severance of eternity,
<tantra> [2081] The definite severance of paths and results,
<tantra> [2082] The view of severance through mistaken mind,
<tantra> [2083] The great severance of emptiness,
<tantra> [2084] Speaking secret Vedas,
<tantra> [2085] Tirthikas of similar wrongness,
<tantra> [2086] Tirthikas of manifest mind,
<tantra> [2087] Tirthikas of confused appearance and grasping,
<tantra> [2088] Tirthikas of producing anger,
<tantra> [2089] Tirthikas of activity and mind,
<tantra> [2090] Tirthikas of grasping meaningless things,
<tantra> [2091] Tirthikas of erroneous speech,
<tantra> [2092] Tirthikas of permanent meaning as nonexistent."
[2093] Kani-pa, who holds meaning to be indifferent;
[2094] Bhasira and Kabisha, who hold opposing views on meaning;
[2095] Sindhara and Dhasim, who distinguish special from common meaning;
[2096] Kati and Samgha, who hold meaning exists yet is cut off;
[2097] Sankari and Dhasaka, who hold compounded things impermanent yet true.
[2098] Thus are the principal Tirthika teachers enumerated.
[2099] The extensive explanation of the meaning of these has two aspects.

[2100] Explaining the three hundred sixty wrong views of space held by Tirthikas;
[2101] And extensively explaining those sixty branches that emerge from them.
[2102] Regarding the first is explained:

<list> [2207] Ascetics—a full hundred.
[2208] These hundred speak of permanence as their view.
[2209] Some among them speak of impermanence alternatively.
[2210] Some speak of both, gathering permanence and impermanence together as one.
[2211] From the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rangshar:
<tantra> [2212] "This too is summarized as the essence of mistaken vehicles:
<tantra> [2213] The extremes of permanence and impermanence.
<tantra> [2214] The meaning of the view of impermanence is as follows:
<tantra> [2215] The great tirthika emptiness of sudden cutoff,
<tantra> [2216] Like the emptiness of space in continuous cutoff,
<tantra> [2217] Viewing the nature of cutoff as completely nonexistent,
<tantra> [2218] The cutoff of results as mere emptiness,
<tantra> [2219] The permanence of the nonexistent emptiness,
<tantra> [2220] The tenets of the permanent vehicle held wrongly,
<tantra> [2221] The tenets of eternal permanence mistaken.
<tantra> [2222] As follows regarding permanent things:
<tantra> [2223] From one's own mind mandala,
<tantra> [2224] Not arising from father causes,
<tantra> [2225] Not depending on mother conditions,
<tantra> [2226] As large as beans in size,
<tantra> [2227] As small as mustard seeds,
<tantra> [2228] As tiny as hair tips,
<tantra> [2229] Oily, smooth, white, and clear.
<tantra> [2230] Thus, that nature of causes,
<tantra> [2231] Exists permanently without change from the beginning.
<tantra> [2232] This and habitual tendencies, aggregates,
<tantra> [2233] Abiding inseparably as one,
<tantra> [2234] Is held as the tenet of permanent causes.
<tantra> [2235] As follows regarding permanent results:
<tantra> [2236] The great lord of fortune itself,
<tantra> [2237] Through virtues of reliance and worship,
<tantra> [2238] Although abandoning this first body,
<tantra> [2239] Produces births on one's own ground.
<tantra> [2240] By the great lord of fortune,
<tantra> [2241] Results are held as permanent.
<tantra> [2242] The two natures of permanence and impermanence,
<tantra> [2243] Do not accord with their own meanings.
<tantra> [2244] Thus it is taught."
[2245] Second, explaining extensively the meaning of those sixty branches:
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 64

<ornament>
[2246] Also from that tantra, the particular explanations:
[2247] The Samkhyas hold views as follows:
<list> [2248] Atoms as ultimate particles,
<list> [2249] Darkness as primal matter,
<list> [2250] And three energies—they hold these as permanent.
<list> [2251] They also hold that delusion is the basis of all action.
<list> [2252] Attachment produces happiness as result.
<list> [2253] Anger turns back armies as power.
<list> [2254] This is the essential doctrine of the Samkhyas.
[2255] The Vaisesika view is as follows:
<list> [2256] They view outer aggregates, elements, and ayatanas as composed of minute atoms.
<list> [2257] They count these as minute atoms grasped by the first grasper, the soul.
<list> [2258] These are the causes and conditions of cessation they seek.
<list> [2259] These are the causes and conditions of ultimate emptiness they accept.
<list> [2260] When the body is abandoned, mind and space remain latent.
<list> [2261] The latent arising of body from these atoms.
<list> [2262] Abiding at the end of trace emptiness.
[2263] The Kumaralabha tenets hold:
<list> [2264] Mind is ultimately nonexistent; body is ultimately nonexistent.
<list> [2265] When mind is nonexistent, body is also nonexistent.
<list> [2266] When mind is nonexistent, at the abandonment of body, all is empty and nonexistent.
[2267] The Karnaputra tenets are as follows:
<list> [2268] They see appearance as permanent through particular circumstances.
<list> [2269] They hold that ultimate appearance is impermanent.
<list> [2270] They hold that future appearance in the retinue of the great lord of fortune is permanent.
<list> [2271] Such is also the accepted doctrine of Karnaputra.
[2272] The secret teaching of the five fires is as follows:
<list> [2273] Sending lamps from persons residing in the Buddha's emanation realms.
<list> [2274] Seeing subtle clairvoyance from the five wisdoms appearing as Buddhas.
<list> [2275] Engaging in the five fires as purification practice.
<list> [2276] Cooking offerings with sandalwood trees and sesame oil.
<list> [2277] Sending the five fires, also burning one's own body as offering.
<list> [2278] Called "fire-cloth"—wrapping one's own body in cloth and sesame oil.
<list> [2279] Burning one's own body with fire as extreme austerity.
<list> [2280] The ascetic conduct of three spear-tips.
<list> [2281] Also, with three spear-tips placed on the ground, jumping from those tips—ascetic conduct.
<list> [2282] Jumping from rocks and cliffs, destroying the body.
<list> [2283] This is called the mistaken conduct of grasping at portions of truth.
<ornament>

<ornament> ### PAGE 65

<ornament>
[2284] The conduct of feeding one's own body flesh to cemetery worms:
[2285] Peeling the skin from one's own body,
[2286] Feeding it to worms in cemetery grounds.
[2287] This is also called mistaken animal conduct.
[2288] The conduct of entering into dog behavior is called mistaken asceticism.
[2289] Speaking of agents as causes of actions is explained:
[2290] For example: like a skilled carpenter, man and woman form different actions.
[2291] Dharma practice through one's own clairvoyance, action done for fortune lord retinue birth.
[2292] The tenet of carrying agents to the path.
[2293] Worldly house and so forth, actions done for this life.
[2294] Future life: abandoning one's own body.
[2295] Receiving fortune lord before oneself, residing on Mount Meru terrace.
[2296] The view indicating permanent meaning.
[2297] Showing one's own meaning permanent, other meaning cut off suddenly.
[2298] Speaking of eternal permanence, the view is thus held.
[2299] The great nature is indefinite in its essence, being permanent and unchangeable.
[2300] Also, speaking of change according to circumstances.
[2301] Thus it is held:
[2302] The view of permanence according to circumstances cuts off the meaning.
[2303] The view of permanent cause is explained:
[2304] In the center of one's own heart, the causal entity is round in shape,
[2305] White in color,
[2306] The size of a small bean.
[2307] It does not arise from the father's cause, and
[2308] It is not produced by the mother's condition—thus is the view of permanence held.
[2309] Thinking that the result is permanent is explained:
[2310] The cause is impermanent, and mind has no substantial existence.
[2311] They say the result is permanent, and that the fortune lord exists.
[2312] Relying on the permanent path is explained:
[2313] The cause is impermanent, and mind has no substantial existence.
[2314] The result is impermanent, and without the fortune lord as a companion on the ground, one does not arrive.
[2315] The path is permanent—the path of the fortune lord resides on the summit of Mount Meru.

[2316] Those who aspire to abide upon the path, regarding conduct as permanent,
[2317] Yet perceiving cause and effect as impermanent—
[2318] Such practitioners, through taking conduct as permanent, seek liberation thereby.
[2319] Objects, dwellings, and households they hold as eternal,
[2320] And all appearances whatsoever they view as permanent.
[2321] Those who view permanence where it does not exist are nihilists in essence,
[2322] For viewing what is permanent as cut off constitutes the nihilistic view.
[2323] Upon this very ground they enact the tenet of permanence.
[2324] Those who wield evil mantras as paramount, performing fierce destructive rites,
[2325] Speaking with the single-pointed resolve of black practitioners,
[2326] Attached thereto, desiring results through such means.
[2327] Those who take divination and prophecy as paramount,
[2328] Caring solely for the happiness of this world,
[2329] Declaring future lives utterly nonexistent.
[2330] Those who take subtle miracles as paramount,
[2331] Turning back armies in this world through magical power,
[2332] In future lives too, wishing to subdue others through magic, seeking rebirth in the retinue of lords or powerful deities.
[2333] Those whose view prioritizes debate,
[2334] Internalizing their own truth while refuting others, harboring such hopes.
[2335] Those who harbor hopes in mistaken ascetic practices.
[2336] Those attached to this world,
[2337] Called "worldly benefit," engaging in the affairs of this world.
[2338] Also, some internalize their own truth while pridefully destroying others' standing.
[2339] Some seek meaning through mere custom.
[2340] Some, having made matted locks of hair, seek meaning thereby.
[2341] Some, wrapping their bodies alternately in single cloths, declare "inner heat has arisen."
[2342] Some, holding khatvanga and damaru as hand-attributes, declare "I am the emanation body."
[2343] Some say "Whatever virtue you perform benefits me," depending upon that meaning.
[2344] Some, by their own reasoning refuting others' reasoning, declare "This is my action," depending upon that meaning.
[2345] Some declare cause as severed, like space, suddenly cut.
[2346] Some declare that sudden cut renders even their own bodies empty.
[2349] Cause severed, effect severed.
<ornament>

<ornament>
[2350] Some assert severance of cause, holding that mind cannot be grasped as an entity.
[2351] Others declare severance of effect, claiming neither life-force nor supreme power exists.
[2352] Moreover, some proclaim severance of path, stating there is nothing whatsoever.
[2353] Others assert severance of primordial wisdom, declaring there is no Buddha.
[2354] There are also those who say cause and effect do not exist, that emptiness is completely severed.
[2355] Some, through dwelling upon the path, declare severance, claiming effects are definitely cut off.
[2356] Through mistaken mind, they claim life-force is severed.
[2357] Some also assert that meaning arises from cutting the life-force.
[2358] Moreover, there are those who declare that severance is emptiness, and since you are severed and I am severed, therefore there is nothing whatsoever.
[2359] The secret speakers of the Vedas proclaim:
<tantra> [2360] "That meaning, like space itself, is completely empty and severed.
<tantra> [2361] Existence as an entity does not exist.
<tantra> [2362] Yet some slight portion exists.
<tantra> [2363] They also claim that appearance to the faculties is possible.
<tantra> [2364] These are called tirthikas who deviate from partial agreement.
<tantra> [2365] They deviate from partial agreement with the Buddhist teachings.
<tantra> [2366] They deviate through wrong understanding of the Buddha's philosophical tenets—these are merely flesh.
<tantra> [2367] Some think manifest appearance is mind's magical display.
<tantra> [2368] They also teach that all is mere magical illusion.
<tantra> [2369] Moreover, some claim these mistaken appearances are true,
<tantra> [2370] While declaring there is no ultimate meaning.
<tantra> [2371] There are even those who assert that through arising anger, spirits are destroyed, and therefore, son of the clan, one should abide in anger.
<tantra> [2372] Some claim that since mind, as object, is self-arisen, it cannot be corrected.
<tantra> [2373] Others declare that relying solely upon meditation on the deity's form is sufficient.
<tantra> [2374] Some, being tirthika practitioners, deviate from tirthika debate-like speech.
<tantra> [2375] Some assert that since only permanence exists, nothing whatsoever need be done.
<tantra> [2376] Kani-pa is so called,
<tantra> [2377] For he holds meaning to be indifferent.
<tantra> [2378] Sersnawa is so called,
<tantra> [2379] For he possesses suffering through fear that appearance will diminish and become empty.
<tantra> [2380] Sambhari is so called."

<tantra> [2381] "Kabhisha is so called, for he wishes that neither special meaning nor common meaning exists.
<tantra> [2382] Sindha is so called,
<tantra> [2383] For he holds that while common meaning does not exist, special meaning does exist.
<tantra> [2384] Dhasimba is so called,
<tantra> [2385] For he wishes that no meaning whatsoever exists.
<tantra> [2386] Katipa is so called,
<tantra> [2387] For he wishes that meaning exists, yet holds it is cut off until the breath ceases.
<tantra> [2388] Sangha is so called—there are also those who claim that since I have entered the features of the sangha, it is sufficient.
<tantra> [2389] Shamkari is so called,
<tantra> [2390] For he holds compounded things to be impermanent and true.
<tantra> [2391] The truth of compounded impermanence
<tantra> [2392] Is the truth of life-force or supreme lord.
<tantra> [2393] Doshaka is so called,
<tantra> [2394] For all sutras are gathered into life-force and supreme power.
<tantra> [2395] There are also those who declare that life-force and supreme power definitely exist upon the summit of Mount Meru.
<tantra> [2396] Thus the numberless views of aggregates are gathered into two categories.
<tantra> [2397] These are permanence and interruption.
<tantra> [2398] From these, the numberless views of aggregates spread forth, it is said.
<tantra> [2399] Thus all teachings are gathered into four:
<tantra> [2400] Extreme view,
<tantra> [2401] Extreme end,
<tantra> [2402] Distant benefit,
<tantra> [2403] And indifference.
<tantra> [2404] Extreme view refers to those who speak of eternal permanence.
<tantra> [2405] Extreme end refers to those who declare permanent is permanent and impermanent is impermanent—both.
<tantra> [2406] Distant benefit refers to those who hold half permanent, half interrupted.
<tantra> [2407] Indifference refers to those who speak of complete severance.
<tantra> [2408] These themselves are also gathered into permanence and interruption.
<tantra> [2409] From the former, those wrong views
<tantra> [2410] Are taught as gathered into four types.
<tantra> [2411] Extreme view, extreme end,
<tantra> [2412] Distant benefit, and indifference.
<tantra> [2413] Thus the explanation is as follows:
<tantra> [2414] Extreme view is eternal permanence.
<tantra> [2415] Extreme end is half permanent, half cut.
<tantra> [2416] Indifference is cut, completely cut.
<tantra> [2417] Distant benefit is effect cut.
<tantra> [2418] Thus the three hundred sixty
<tantra> [2419] Are gathered into four types.
<tantra> [2420] These are also gathered into permanence and interruption,
<tantra> [2421] Thus it is said.
<tantra> [2422] The purpose of teaching these
<tantra> [2423] Is that one does not enter wrong paths through recognition.
<tantra> [2424] From those same teachings."

<tantra> [2428] "Thus spoke: 'Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates.'"
[2429] The outsiders' philosophical positions are now explained.
[2430] Second, the extensive division of transcendent vehicles has three aspects:
<list> [2431] The method superior to outsiders,
<list> [2432] The general explanation of categories,
<list> [2433] And the extensive particular explanation.
[2434] First: accepting the four dharma-seal mudras and going for refuge to the Three Jewels—this is superior, for outsiders' paths lack this.
[2435] The four mudras are: all compounded things impermanent,
<list> [2436] All with defilements suffering,
<list> [2437] All dharmas empty and selfless,
<list> [2438] Liberation from suffering peaceful.
[2439] Second has five aspects:
<list> [2440] Essence,
<list> [2441] Definition,
<list> [2442] Division,
<list> [2443] Purpose,
<list> [2444] And effect.
[2445] The essence of the transcendent vehicle:
[2446] That dharma-category which is the supreme method for definitely exiting samsara.
[2447] Definition: that which, when entered, produces happiness.
[2448] From the Compendium:
<tantra> [2449] "Mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—
<tantra> [2450] Joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue.
<tantra> [2451] This vehicle, like space, a measureless great palace.
<tantra> [2452] Thus it is said."
[2453] Division:
<list> [2454] Small and great, two;
<list> [2455] Or hearer, self-enlightened, and bodhisattva vehicles, three—
<list> [2456] Inconceivable, regarding disciples' minds.
[2457] From the Lankavatara:
<tantra> [2458] "As long as mind engages,
<tantra> [2459] The vehicle's limits are endless.
<tantra> [2460] Thus it is said."
[2461] Purpose: accomplishing temporary and ultimate meanings.
[2462] Effect: definitely exiting the three realms, obtaining liberation.
[2463] Third: extensive particular explanation.
[2464] From Rigpa Rangshar, the vehicle divisions are thus:
<tantra> [2465] "Sutra and great extensive,
<tantra> [2466] And also the great extensive.
<tantra> [2467] The great extensive:
<tantra> [2468] Eighty-four thousand inconceivable,
<tantra> [2469] Extensively numbered, many and great,
<tantra> [2470] Inconceivable, measureless,
<tantra> [2471] Inexpressible, thought-transcending, great.
<tantra> [2472] Thus the great victor.
<tantra> [2473] Inexpressible, transcending thought, great.
<tantra> [2474] Thus the great victor."
<ornament>

[2475] Divisions considered as nine types:
<list> [2476] Listener and self-enlightened,
<list> [2477] And thus bodhisattva.
<list> [2478] Kriya and Upa,
<list> [2479] And thus explained as Yoga vehicle.
<list> [2480] Maha, Anu, Yoga,
<list> [2481] And thus Dzogchen Ati.
<tantra> [2482] "Thus taught as nine types,
<tantra> [2483] This is the Great Dharma Teaching."
[2484] Thus spoke, establishing the meaning:
[2485] Generally, Buddha's Dharma classifications limitless,
[2486] Gathered into vehicles alone:
<list> [2487] Vehicles generally taught, great and small, two;
<list> [2488] Characteristic vehicle,
<list> [2489] Effect vajra vehicle;
<list> [2490] Explained extensively:
<list> [2491] Upon three inferior faculties,
<list> [2492] Listener, self-enlightened, bodhisattva vehicles, three;
<list> [2493] Upon three medium, Kriya, Upa, Yoga, three;
<list> [2494] Upon three sharp,
<list> [2495] Maha, Anu, Ati, three taught.
[2496] From Ati Kopa Chenpo:
<tantra> [2497] "The Dharmas I taught
<tantra> [2498] From beings' mind stages,
<tantra> [2499] By differences of great and small,
<tantra> [2500] Taught as two-stage method.
<tantra> [2501] Each view left in its place.
<tantra> [2502] Each self has two stages:
<tantra> [2503] Inverted and correct view.
<tantra> [2504] By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara.
<tantra> [2505] Correct: three stages—
<tantra> [2506] Small mind and great,
<tantra> [2507] And thus medium mind possessed,
<tantra> [2508] Taught as three-stage method.
<tantra> [2509] Small stage: three types—
<tantra> [2510] Dharmas compatible with those views,
<tantra> [2511] Obscured by thought: listener.
<tantra> [2512] Conception possessed: self-enlightened.
<tantra> [2513] Thought-grasp possessed: bodhisattva.
<tantra> [2514] Upon three medium, teaching:
<tantra> [2515] Upon very inferior: deeds,
<tantra> [2516] Action upon inferiors.
<tantra> [2517] Consciousness possessed: yoga itself.
<tantra> [2518] Upon three great stage possessed,
<tantra> [2519] Vast mind: generation,
<tantra> [2520] Concentrated mind: completion.
<tantra> [2521] Supreme fresh supreme: great completion.
<tantra> [2522] Thus."
[2523] Very extensive great vehicle:
<tantra> [2524] "All Word gathered in three baskets,
<tantra> [2525] Mantras being manifest great—"

[2526] Herein, what are the two divisions?
[2527] First, explaining Vaibhasika:
<list> [2528] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
<list> [2529] And the aggregates, elements, and sense-bases as truly established.
<list> [2530] They assert direct perception, inference, and scripture as valid cognitions.
<list> [2531] The view of the path is established through three characteristics.
<list> [2532] The effects are explained as four pairs of persons.
<list> [2533] Thus explaining the Vaibhasika view.
[2534] Second, explaining Sautrantika:
<list> [2535] They hold the four truths as directly realized,
<list> [2536] And emptiness and selflessness as the nature of realization.
<list> [2537] Cognizing cognitions are twelvefold knowing.
<list> [2538] Objects are established as the four truths.
