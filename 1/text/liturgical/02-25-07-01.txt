<tantra> [16924] From Lamp That Illuminates:
<tantra> [16925] "For perfectly complete Buddha,
<tantra> [16926] Three aspects of wisdom:
<tantra> [16927] Knowing all aspects,
<tantra> [16928] All-knowing wisdom,
<tantra> [16929] Ground-abiding wisdom.
<tantra> [16930] Emanation-kāya's two wisdoms:
<tantra> [16931] Through knowing nature, knowing pattern;
<tantra> [16932] Through knowing extent, others' benefit.
<tantra> [16933] Saṃbhoga-kāya's direct appearance
<tantra> [16934] Luminosity-wisdom's knowables self-clear.
<tantra> [16935] Dharma-kāya's ground-abiding wisdom:
<tantra> [16936] Knowing aspect is clear-maker,
<tantra> [16937] Without family-conception grasping;
<tantra> [16938] Natural or spontaneous compassion.
<tantra> [16939] Clear, knowing, with awareness,
<tantra> [16940] Without mixture in aspects, abiding."
<tantra> [16941] Thus it is spoken.

[16942] The third: summary of Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities' five fields' meaning comprises two:
<list> [16943] Essence briefly shown;
<list> [16944] Nature extensively explained.

[16944] The first:
[16945] Thus all Buddha-ground phenomena summarized:
[16946] Body: unceasing ornament-wheel, form-kāya with marks and signs appearing;
[16947] Dharma-kāya: nature possessing complete subsidence of all elaboration;
[16948] Speech: unceasing ornament-wheel, with inconceivable Dharma-wheel's teachings;

[16952] Qualities: unceasing ornament-wheel,
[16953] Ten powers,
[16954] Four fearlessnesses,
[16955] Immeasurable great compassion,
[16956] Mindfulness establishments, and so forth;
[16957] Activities: unceasing ornament-wheel, throughout space's end, all beings' two benefits spontaneously accomplished.
[16958] This much includes all enumerations of Buddha-ground phenomena—thus one should know.

<tantra> [16959] From Lion's Perfect Power Great Tantra:
<tantra> [16960] "Buddhas' bodies,
<tantra> [16961] Speech and mind-maṇḍalas,
<tantra> [16962] Qualities, activities—five-fold appearance."
<tantra> [16963] Thus it is spoken.

[16964] The second: from detailed divisions of Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities five:

[16965] First, Body also: essence,
[16966] Definitive terminology,
[16967] Divisions—three aspects.

[16968] Body's essence:
[16969] Buddha-ground's support, without transfer or change.
[16970] Definitive terminology: perfected in Body—thus called Kāya.
[16971] In Buddha-ground, though without Body or entity, mere name is not contradictory.

<tantra> [16972] From Jewel Lamp Sūtra:
<tantra> [16973] "Dharma-kāya is Victorious Ones' Body;
<tantra> [16974] Viewing it purifies, thus one knows."
<tantra> [16975] Thus it is spoken.

[16976] Divisions:
[16977] Dharma-kāya: free from elaboration,
[16978] Saṃbhoga-kāya: free from marks,
[16979] Emanation-kāya: free from determination.

<tantra> [16980] From Perfect Power:
<tantra> [16981] "Body's essence: unchanging;

[16993] Six migrations' confusion-conforming Speech appearing as individual sounds;
[16994] Beings' faith Speech satisfying faculties;
[16995] Symbolic Speech demonstrating meaning through symbols;
[16996] Word Speech: resounding in those to be trained's ears, purifying afflictions.
[16997] These too are divided through Emanation-kāya's single-essence distinctions;
[16998] For Saṃbhoga-kāya, merely symbolic;
[16999] For Dharma-kāya, no appearance from expressionless meaning-Speech.
[17000] Emanation-kāya's appearing Speech too is like echo's aspect—


### PAGE 410

[17001] Actually non-existent, yet variously appearing,
[17002] Resounding from those to be trained's merit and Buddha's blessing collection, without words' own marks.

<tantra> [17003] From Sublime Continuum:
<tantra> [17004] "Victorious Ones' Speech
<tantra> [17005] Is like echo: without letters.
<tantra> [17006] Thus,
<tantra> [17007] Just as echo's sound
<tantra> [17008] Arises from others' cognition,
<tantra> [17009] Without conception, without fabrication,
<tantra> [17010] Thus Tathāgata's Speech:
<tantra> [17011] Arising from others' cognition,
<tantra> [17012] Without conception, without fabrication,
<tantra> [17013] Thus Tathāgata's Speech:
<tantra> [17014] Neither outer nor inner."
<tantra> [17015] Thus it is spoken.

[17016] These meanings too from Perfect Power:
<tantra> [17017] "Speech's essence: empty of sound;
<tantra> [17018] Speech's definitive terminology: variously arising;
<tantra> [17019] Divisions: six aspects shown.

<tantra> [17023] Beings' faith training sound,
<tantra> [17024] Secret mother's symbolic sound,
<tantra> [17025] Various resounding Speech shown."
<tantra> [17026] Thus it is spoken.

[17027] Third, Mind: essence without delusion,
[17028] Definitive terminology: Awareness clearly abiding in own place,
[17029] Divisions: Awareness-wisdom of complete abandonment, mindfulness-ceased Mind;
[17030] Awareness-wisdom of complete realization, unchanging Vajra-Mind;
[17031] Awareness-wisdom of complete deeds, various-knowing Mind—three.

<tantra> [17032] From that very text:
<tantra> [17033] "Mind's essence: without delusion;
<tantra> [17034] Mind's definitive terminology: appears as thought;
<tantra> [17035] Divisions: three aspects shown.
<tantra> [17036] Mind itself: ceased mindfulness,
<tantra> [17037] And Vajra unchanging Mind,
<tantra> [17038] Various-knowing Mind shown."
<tantra> [17039] Thus it is spoken.

[17040] Fourth, Qualities: essence—Buddha-ground's perfected phenomena,
[17041] Definitive terminology: spontaneously arising all nine perfections, like a jewel,
[17042] Divisions:
[17043] Ground-qualities: Dharma-kāya abiding in own place, self-benefit complete;
[17044] Path-qualities: Saṃbhoga-kāya clear in vase, other-benefit manifestation arising;


### PAGE 411

[17045] Fruition-qualities: Emanation-kāya guiding beings, conducting to ultimate Dharma-kāya.

<tantra> [17046] From that very text:
<tantra> [17047] "Qualities' essence: all-arising;
<tantra> [17048] Qualities' definitive terminology: variously perfected;
<tantra> [17049] Divisions: three aspects shown.
<tantra> [17050] Ground-abiding qualities,
<tantra> [17051] Path-appearance qualities,
<tantra> [17052] Fruition-conducting qualities."
<tantra> [17053] Thus it is spoken.

[17054] Fifth, Activities: also
[17055] Essence,
[17056] Definitive terminology,
[17057] Divisions—three aspects.

[17058] Activities' essence: spontaneously accomplishing beings' benefit until Saṃsāra's end.

<tantra> [17059] From Ornament of Realization:
<tantra> [17060] "Thus, as long as existence,
<tantra> [17061] Activities are considered unceasing."
<tantra> [17062] Thus it is spoken.

[17063] Definitive terminology:
[17064] Three-kāyas' activities for those to be trained, action and afflictions purified, conducting to Buddha-ground—thus "activity."
[17065] Knowing those to be trained's dispositions and
[17066] Latencies,
[17067] Accordingly benefitting, yet without effort or striving—like showing moon in water.

<tantra> [17068] From Sublime Continuum:
<tantra> [17069] "Those to be trained's dispositions, training deeds,
<tantra> [17070] Their fields and suchnesses,
<tantra> [17071] Pervading Lord always spontaneously engages."
<tantra> [17072] Thus it is spoken.

[17073] Divisions: four:

<tantra> [17074] From Great Self-Arisen Tantra:
<tantra> [17075] "Pacifying, increasing,
<tantra> [17076] Similarly empowering and fierce."
<tantra> [17077] Thus it is spoken.

[17078] Through pacifying:
[17079] Purifying beings' obscurations, extinguishing all suffering—unceasing ornament-wheel arises.

[17080] Through increasing:
[17081] Increasing beings' qualities, fulfilling all desires' hopes.

[17082] Through empowering:
[17083] Harmoniously gathering beings, ripening the unripened through great empowerment-stream's river.

[17084] Through fierceness:

[17088] Perfecting all supreme awakening's fruition,
[17089] Greatly perfecting Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, Activities' unceasing ornament-wheels' fields.

<tantra> [17100] Empowering ripens the unripened;
<tantra> [17101] Fierceness completely cuts off all."
<tantra> [17102] Thus extensively spoken.

<tantra> [17103] From Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury:
