[16899] These wisdoms' meaning summarized in three kāyas, clearly:
[16900] In such a Buddha, regarding Dharma-kāya's field:
[16901] Three wisdoms are complete in the ground:
<list> [16902] Essence: primordially pure wisdom;
<list> [16903] Nature: spontaneous presence wisdom;
<list> [16904] Compassion: all-pervasive wisdom—three, without mark-distinction,
[16905] From awareness's clear aspect, naturally or spontaneously making knowing's manifestation-basis.

[16906] In saṃbhoga-kāya's field, mark-grasping five wisdoms individually clear:
<list> [16907] Dharmadhātu,
<list> [16908] Mirror-like,
<list> [16909] Equality,
<list> [16910] Discriminating,
<list> [16911] All-accomplishing wisdoms—not object and subject, but direct appearance's self-clear.

[16912] In emanation-kāya's time, divided into two knowing wisdoms:
<list> [16913] Knowing nature of things (*ji lta ba*),
<list> [16914] Knowing extent of things (*ji snyed pa*)—
[16915] Yet these two are not with object and agent, but knowing through effortless spontaneous presence manner.

[16916] Thus Buddha, possessing three-kāya identity, three wisdoms:
[16917] Regarding emanation-kāya external display's knowable-aspects' appearance-emptiness knowing,
[16918] Phenomena's aspects and
[16919] Dharmatā peaceful aspects—all-knowing wisdom;
[16920] Regarding saṃbhoga-kāya direct appearance's self-appearing luminosity-wisdom's knowable-aspects self-clearly knowing,
[16921] All-knowing wisdom;
[16922] Dharma-kāya inner clarity's essence ground-abiding wisdom's manifestation-basis aspect,
[16923] Merely self-knowing clear in primordially pure own-place Expanse—pure expanse's manifestation abiding.

<tantra> [16924] From Lamp That Illuminates:
<tantra> [16925] "For perfectly complete Buddha,
<tantra> [16926] Three aspects of wisdom:
<tantra> [16927] Knowing all aspects,
<tantra> [16928] All-knowing wisdom,
<tantra> [16929] Ground-abiding wisdom.
<tantra> [16930] Emanation-kāya's two wisdoms:
<tantra> [16931] Through knowing nature, knowing pattern;
<tantra> [16932] Through knowing extent, others' benefit.
<tantra> [16933] Saṃbhoga-kāya's direct appearance
<tantra> [16934] Luminosity-wisdom's knowables self-clear.
<tantra> [16935] Dharma-kāya's ground-abiding wisdom:
<tantra> [16936] Knowing aspect is clear-maker,
<tantra> [16937] Without family-conception grasping;
<tantra> [16938] Natural or spontaneous compassion.
<tantra> [16939] Clear, knowing, with awareness,
<tantra> [16940] Without mixture in aspects, abiding."
<tantra> [16941] Thus it is spoken.

[16942] The third: summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities' five fields' meaning comprises two:
<list> [16943] Essence briefly shown;
<list> [16944] Nature extensively explained.

[16944] The first:
[16945] Thus all Buddha-ground phenomena summarized:
[16946] Body: unceasing ornament-wheel, form-kāya with marks and signs appearing;
[16947] Dharma-kāya: nature possessing complete subsidence of all elaboration;
[16948] Speech: unceasing ornament-wheel, with inconceivable Dharma-wheel's teachings;
[16949] Mind: unceasing ornament-wheel, nature of abandonment and thought, immeasurable;
[16950] Clairvoyance, inconceivable, and
[16951] Samādhi ocean's essence, great ocean, and so forth;
[16952] Qualities: unceasing ornament-wheel,
[16953] Ten powers,
[16954] Four fearlessnesses,
[16955] Immeasurable great compassion,
[16956] Mindfulness establishments, and so forth;
[16957] Activities: unceasing ornament-wheel, throughout space's end, all beings' two benefits spontaneously accomplished.
[16958] This much includes all enumerations of Buddha-ground phenomena—thus one should know.

<tantra> [16959] From Lion's Perfect Power Great Tantra:
<tantra> [16960] "Buddhas' bodies,
<tantra> [16961] Speech and mind-maṇḍalas,
<tantra> [16962] Qualities, activities—five-fold appearance."
<tantra> [16963] Thus it is spoken.

[16964] The second: from detailed divisions of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities five:

[16965] First, body also: essence,
[16966] Definitive terminology,
[16967] Divisions—three aspects.

[16975] Body's essence:
[16976] Buddha-ground's support, without transfer or change.
[16977] Definitive terminology: perfected in body—thus called kāya.
[16978] In Buddha-ground, though without body or entity, mere name is not contradictory.

<tantra> [16979] From Jewel Lamp Sūtra:
<tantra> [16980] "Dharma-kāya is Victorious Ones' body;
<tantra> [16981] Viewing it purifies, thus one knows."
<tantra> [16982] Thus it is spoken.

[16983] Divisions:
[16984] Dharma-kāya: free from elaboration,
[16985] Saṃbhoga-kāya: free from marks,
[16986] Emanation-kāya: free from determination.

<tantra> [16987] From Perfect Power:
<tantra> [16988] "Body's essence: unchanging;
<tantra> [16989] Body's definitive terminology: clear and blazing;
<tantra> [16990] Divisions: three aspects shown.
<tantra> [16991] Possessing Dharma-kāya, saṃbhoga-kāya, emanation-kāya;
<tantra> [16992] Dharma-kāya's defining characteristic: free from thought;
<tantra> [16993] Saṃbhoga-kāya's defining characteristic: clear, without conception;
<tantra> [16994] Emanation-kāya's defining characteristic: showing various."
<tantra> [16995] Thus it is spoken.

[16996] Speech: essence empty of sound,
[16997] Definitive terminology: various Dharma-collections appearing in Expanse,
[16998] Divisions: great deed Speech appearing appropriately for whoever;
[16999] Brahma's Speech appearing as six limbs;
[17000] Six migrations' confusion-conforming Speech appearing as individual sounds;
[17001] Beings' faith Speech satisfying faculties;
[17002] Symbolic Speech demonstrating meaning through symbols;
[17003] Word Speech: resounding in those to be trained's ears, purifying afflictions.
[17004] These too are divided through emanation-kāya's single-essence distinctions;
[17005] For saṃbhoga-kāya, merely symbolic;
[17006] For Dharma-kāya, no appearance from expressionless meaning-Speech.
[17007] Emanation-kāya's appearing Speech too is like echo's aspect—
[17008] Actually non-existent, yet variously appearing,
[17009] Resounding from those to be trained's merit and Buddha's blessing collection, without words' own marks.

<tantra> [17010] From Sublime Continuum:
<tantra> [17011] "Victorious Ones' speech
<tantra> [17012] Is like echo: without letters.
<tantra> [17013] Thus,
<tantra> [17014] Just as echo's sound
<tantra> [17015] Arises from others' cognition,
<tantra> [17016] Without conception, without fabrication,
<tantra> [17017] Thus Tathāgata's speech:
<tantra> [17018] Arising from others' cognition,
<tantra> [17019] Without conception, without fabrication,
<tantra> [17020] Thus Tathāgata's speech:
<tantra> [17021] Neither outer nor inner."
<tantra> [17022] Thus it is spoken.

[17023] These meanings too from Perfect Power:
<tantra> [17024] "Speech's essence: empty of sound;
<tantra> [17025] Speech's definitive terminology: variously arising;
<tantra> [17026] Divisions: six aspects shown.
<tantra> [17027] Buddha's deed Speech,
<tantra> [17028] Brahma gods' offering Speech,
<tantra> [17029] Six migrations' confusion-own sound,
<tantra> [17030] Beings' faith training sound,
<tantra> [17031] Secret mother's symbolic sound,
<tantra> [17032] Various resounding Speech shown."
<tantra> [17033] Thus it is spoken.

[17034] Third, mind: essence without delusion,
[17035] Definitive terminology: awareness clearly abiding in own place,
[17036] Divisions: awareness-wisdom of complete abandonment, mindfulness-ceased mind;
[17037] Awareness-wisdom of complete realization, unchanging vajra-mind;
[17038] Awareness-wisdom of complete deeds, various-knowing mind—three.

<tantra> [17039] From that very text:
<tantra> [17040] "Mind's essence: without delusion;
<tantra> [17041] Mind's definitive terminology: appears as thought;
<tantra> [17042] Divisions: three aspects shown.
<tantra> [17043] Mind itself: ceased mindfulness,
<tantra> [17044] And vajra unchanging mind,
<tantra> [17045] Various-knowing mind shown."
<tantra> [17046] Thus it is spoken.

[17047] Fourth, qualities: essence—Buddha-ground's perfected phenomena,
[17048] Definitive terminology: spontaneously arising all nine perfections, like a jewel,
[17049] Divisions:
[17050] Ground-qualities: Dharma-kāya abiding in own place, self-benefit complete;
[17051] Path-qualities: saṃbhoga-kāya clear in vase, other-benefit manifestation arising;
[17052] Fruition-qualities: emanation-kāya guiding beings, conducting to ultimate Dharma-kāya.

<tantra> [17053] From that very text:
<tantra> [17054] "Qualities' essence: all-arising;
<tantra> [17055] Qualities' definitive terminology: variously perfected;
<tantra> [17056] Divisions: three aspects shown.
<tantra> [17057] Ground-abiding qualities,
<tantra> [17058] Path-appearance qualities,
<tantra> [17059] Fruition-conducting qualities."
<tantra> [17060] Thus it is spoken.

[17061] Fifth, activities: also
[17062] Essence,
[17063] Definitive terminology,
[17064] Divisions—three aspects.

[17065] Activities' essence: spontaneously accomplishing beings' benefit until samsara's end.

<tantra> [17066] From Ornament of Realization:
<tantra> [17067] "Thus, as long as existence,
<tantra> [17068] Activities are considered unceasing."
<tantra> [17069] Thus it is spoken.

[17070] Definitive terminology:
[17071] Three-kāyas' activities for those to be trained, action and afflictions purified, conducting to Buddha-ground—thus "activity."
[17072] Knowing those to be trained's dispositions and
[17073] Latencies,
[17074] Accordingly benefitting, yet without effort or striving—like showing moon in water.

<tantra> [17075] From Sublime Continuum:
<tantra> [17076] "Those to be trained's dispositions, training deeds,
<tantra> [17077] Their fields and suchnesses,
<tantra> [17078] Pervading lord always spontaneously engages."
<tantra> [17079] Thus it is spoken.

[17080] Divisions: four:

<tantra> [17081] From Great Self-Arisen Tantra:
<tantra> [17082] "Pacifying, increasing,
<tantra> [17083] Similarly empowering and fierce."
<tantra> [17084] Thus it is spoken.

[17085] Through pacifying:
[17086] Purifying beings' obscurations, extinguishing all suffering—unceasing ornament-wheel arises.

[17087] Through increasing:
[17088] Increasing beings' qualities, fulfilling all desires' hopes.

[17089] Through empowering:
[17090] Harmoniously gathering beings, ripening the unripened through great empowerment-stream's river.

[17091] Through fierceness:
[17092] Cutting off cruel ones, pressing three realms into Expanse,
[17093] Suppressing three existences,
[17094] Liberating samsara-nirvāṇa,
[17095] Perfecting all supreme awakening's fruition,
[17096] Greatly perfecting body, speech, mind, qualities, activities' unceasing ornament-wheels' fields.

[17097] Thus too:

<tantra> [17098] From Lion's Perfect Power Great Tantra:
<tantra> [17099] "Activities' essence: accomplishes;
<tantra> [17100] Activities' definitive terminology: deeds;
<tantra> [17101] Divisions: four aspects shown.
<tantra> [17102] Emaho!
<tantra> [17103] Pacifying, increasing,
<tantra> [17104] Similarly empowering and fierce.
<tantra> [17105] Pacifying gathers into Dharmatā Expanse;
<tantra> [17106] Increasing shows various natures;
<tantra> [17107] Empowering ripens the unripened;
<tantra> [17108] Fierceness completely cuts off all."
<tantra> [17109] Thus extensively spoken.
