[4696] First: wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner;
[4697] Train in three bodies' gaze manners.
[4698] From Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
[4699] By dharmakaya gaze manner,
[4700] Press and extract three-realms' samsara;
[4701] Sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground;
[4702] Nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field.
[4703] Thus said, and:
[4704] From Letterless:
[4705] Gaze eye at sky element.
[4706] Thus said, and:
[4707] From Secret Sound Tantra:
[4708] Lower, reverse, corner—three;
[4709] Gaze manner types three, famous.
[4710] Thus it was said.
[4711] That also: nirmanakaya, lower, buddha, looking at disciples;
[4712] Sambhogakaya, corner look, buddha, looking at field-realm;
[4713] Dharmakaya, reverse, buddha, looking at base.
[4714] Yogin with bad eye faculty:
[4715] Harmonizing with nirmanakaya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists.
[4716] Eye possessing fault:
[4717] Harmonizing with sambhogakaya, eye clear purpose exists.
[4718] Eye faculty good:
[4719] Harmonizing with dharmakaya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists.  Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes.  Dharmakaya: dharmata eye existing in speech.
[4720] By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
[4721] This same, certain.
[4722] Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[4723] By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[4724] Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[4725] By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
[4726] Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.
[4727] That also: three-eyes gaze,
[4728] Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[4729] Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[4730] Equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point.
[4731] Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[4732] Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[4733] What is three gaze manners' determination?
[4734] Lazy one: sambhogakaya;
[4735] Diligent one: nirmanakaya;
[4736] Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious;
[4737] Therefore three determined.
[4738] Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata,
[4739] Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[4740] Mode: liberating from samsara.
[4741] Second, field's main-point:
[4742] Outer dhatu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[4743] Inner dhatu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[4744] Dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[4745] From Thalgyur:
[4746] Dhatu: outer and inner;
