[3766] The first is explained:
[3767] The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature.
[3768] The abiding is self-purified.
[3769] When divided:
[3770] <list> Ocean Space and
[3771] <list> Sky Space—these two.
[3772] The essence of Ocean Space, eternally self-liberated beyond extremes,
[3773] Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself.
[3774] Without the two extremes of multiplicity.
[3775] These divide into two:
[3776] <list> Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.
[3777] The first is explained:
[3778] Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated,
[3779] When relied upon, mind-emptiness is thoroughly purified,
[3780] The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible,
[3781] Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty—
[3782] By emptiness, nowhere is anything established—this is the intent.
[3783] The Small Ocean Space:
[3784] Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain,
[3785] Through the particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent.
[3786] The essence of Sky Space:
[3787] Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated.
[3788] When divided, these are two:
[3789] <list> Sun-Moon Space and
[3790] <list> Jewel White Space—these two.
[3791] The first is explained:
[3792] The essence is utterly pure emptiness,
[3793] Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated.
[3794] The second is explained:
[3795] Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified,
[3796] Through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.
[3797] The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known,
[3798] When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding.
[3799] When divided, there are three:
[3800] <list> The Outer Infinite Space free from action,
[3801] <list> The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position,
[3802] <list> The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal,
[3803] <list> The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.
[3804] The first is explained:
[3805] Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point,
[3806] Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point,
[3807] Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point.
[3808] Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-saṃsāra.

[3809] Through mind without cause-sign, the non-dual object of desire.
[3810] The second is explained:
[3811] Through not relying on the eight vehicles, the exertion of progression is abandoned,
[3812] Though appearances arise in manifold forms, liberation comes from the one—not-ceased self-nature arising, so it is called.
[3813] That also, the ultimate of the Great Perfection's accomplishment:
[3814] Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising,
[3815] Whatever is not rejected is completely perfected,
[3816] The basis of all phenomena, in whatever direction, is not exceeded.
[3817] Dharmatā arising in manifold forms, even in India, is not exhausted.
[3818] The third is explained:
[3819] Appearance, when drawn into mind, the rays of self-awareness clearly manifest,
[3820] Appearance not rejected, completely perfected,
[3821] The rays of mind's continuity, through recollection and meditation clearly manifest—recollection and meditation perfected in dharmatā, thus continuity emptied and purified, so it is called.
[3822] Perception and awareness entering, through severance of non-dual connection, saṃsāra's essence is completely liberated, so it is called.
[3823] The Great Perfection of self-arising desire:
[3824] <list> Through view being non-existent, beyond conceptual imputation,
[3825] <list> Through meditation being non-existent, without acceptance, rejection, negation, or establishment,
[3826] <list> Through conduct being non-existent, action is liberated in dharmatā,
[3827] <list> Through result being non-existent, non-attainment abides in itself.
[3828] Among these, when divided:
[3829] Enumeration is beyond measure.
[3830] The spreading of key-points—that very suchness's vast compassion:
[3831] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's dharmas, arising in the kāya and jñāna of appearing-awareness, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa wherever not divided—dharmatā, so it is called.
[3832] That also, through dual proliferation of the non-changing mark and appearing-awareness, saṃsāra is reversed.
[3833] The key-point of clearly seeing one's own face, through self-and-other proliferation of recollection and meditation, thought is completely purified, so it is called.
[3834] Through non-existence of outer and inner objects, bliss without concepts, awakening—so it is called.
[3835] Through freedom from action, mind is beyond,
[3836] Through self-knowing examination, bliss and suffering have equal taste—so it is called.
[3837] These too, when gathered, are collected into three.

[3838] The space free from action, through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation—
[3839] Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation.
[3840] Thus it is said.
[3841] The space of ornament:
[3842] Appearance is the continuity of mind,
[3843] The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called.
[3844] Furthermore:
[3845] Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived.
[3846] Thus it is said.
[3847] The space of play:
[3848] The play without direction, unceasing, arises,
[3849] The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called.
[3850] Furthermore:
[3851] For the sake of liberating all into the completely pure path.
[3852] Thus it is said.
[3853] The space of dharmatā:
[3854] Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not,
[3855] The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual.
[3856] Furthermore:
[3857] The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all.
[3858] Thus it is said.
[3859] The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive—is:
[3860] The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint.
[3861] This is divided into three:
[3862] <list> Taught in the manner of oral transmission,
[3863] <list> Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction,
[3864] <list> Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.
[3865] Among these, the essence of oral transmission is:
[3866] The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced.
[3867] The division:
[3868] <list> The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation,
[3869] <list> The two instructions that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.
