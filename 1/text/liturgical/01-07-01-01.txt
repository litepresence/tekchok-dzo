[9704] <tantra> From the Tantra of Supreme Samaya:
[9705] <tantra> "Samaya is the vajra continuity of awareness—
[9706] <tantra> The indivisible cross of spontaneous presence, certain as the natural state."
[9707] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9708] Regarding the essential definition:
[9709] <tantra> From that same source:
[9710] <tantra> "Generally, that which is called samaya
[9711] <tantra> Is the mind itself, unbroken, the self-display of rigpa,
[9712] <tantra> Free from all deception—self-liberated from the first."
[9713] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 10 ||
[9714] If classified according to the natural display of the Great Perfection,
[9715] There are two: root samaya as three kayas' spontaneous presence, and branch samaya as wisdom's natural expression.
[9716] The root consists of the three: Body, Speech, and Mind—
[9717] The Nirmanakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Dharmakaya's unceasing display.
[9718] The branches are twenty-five,
[9719] <list> To accept as the self-liberated display,
[9720] <list> Not to abandon, for nothing to abandon exists,
[9721] <list> To practice as the spontaneous activity of awareness,
[9722] <list> To accomplish—the natural perfection of the view.
[9723] Here, if classified specifically, || 20 ||
[9724] <list> View—the recognition of rigpa's own face,
[9725] <list> Conduct—the natural expression without acceptance or rejection,
[9726] <list] Practice—the continuity of non-meditation,
[9727] <list> Common—the equality of all phenomena,
[9728] <list> Particular Body-Speech-Mind—the three kayas' self-display,
[9729] <ornament> Branches—the unceasing display of wisdom,
[9730] <list> And crucial, certain samaya—the recognition that keeper and kept are not two—
[9731] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[9732] <tantra> "The hundred-thousand-fold spoken samayas,
[9733] <tantra> Briefly taught—well hold these in mind: || 30 ||
[9734] <tantra> Samaya is not kept, but spontaneously perfect."
[9735] <verse> "The samaya of realizing view—rigpa knowing itself,
[9736] <verse> The samaya of tantric conduct—natural expression without contrivance,
[9737] <verse> The samaya of general practice—the unbroken continuum of awareness,
[9738] <verse> The samaya of general commonality—the equality of samsara and nirvana,
[9739] <verse> The samaya of Body-Speech-Mind—the three kayas' self-display,
[9740] <verse> The samaya of branch enumerations—wisdom's unceasing emanation,
[9741] <verse> And the crucial, certain samaya—the recognition of keeper as rigpa."
[9742] These and other samayas
[9743] Are extensively summarized, great in scope, || 40 ||
[9744] The natural display of the mind's own essence.
[9745] Thus it is spoken.
[9746] The basis is teacher and student as spontaneous presence, vajra siblings as the display of awareness.
[9747] <tantra> From that same source:
[9748] <tantra> "Inconceivable are these samayas,
[9749] <tantra> Spoken to gather in two aspects:
[9750] <tantra> Teacher and student, these two—
[9751] <tantra> The spontaneous presence of awareness, universally renowned.
[9752] <tantra> The cause of protection is the teacher—the Dharmakaya's display;
[9753] <tantra> The one who makes protection is the student—the recognition of that display."
[9754] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 50 ||
[9755] The vajra siblings are also ascertained as four, the natural mandala of awareness.
[9756] <tantra> From that same source:
[9757] <tantra> "To the vajra sibling, four meanings are taught:
[9758] <tantra> General, close, mixed, and
[9759] <tantra> Mandala-vase-mixed—all displays of the unbroken continuum."
[9760] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9761] Moreover, all who have entered the teachings in general are the general display of awareness, and specifically all who have entered Secret Mantra are general siblings of the vajra continuity.
[9762] Those of one Dharma-family are close siblings—self-liberated in the same recognition.
[9763] Those gathered by one Guru are mixed siblings—spontaneously gathered by wisdom.
[9764] Those upon whom a single empowerment has been bestowed at one time, in one mandala, with one lamp, one vase—these are extremely mixed siblings, the indivisible vajra family. || 60 ||
[9765] These should also be known to become objects of sevenfold strictness—the unbroken samaya of awareness.
[9766] Regarding the teacher, there is the general teacher honored by all as teacher—the Nirmanakaya display, and
[9767] The teacher who draws one to connect with the Dharma oneself—the Sambhogakaya display,
[9768] The teacher who bestows samaya and vows, the empowerment teacher—the mandala of spontaneous presence,
[9769] The teacher who gives instruction and transmission—thus four, the complete display of the three kayas.
[9770] <tantra> From that same source:
[9771] <tantra> "Regarding the teacher, four meanings exist:
[9772] <tantra> General, drawing, samaya-empowerment,
[9773] <tantra> Instruction-transmission teacher—all aspects of the mind's unbroken continuum."
[9774] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 70 ||
[9775] The definition of teacher and student is also:
[9776] <tantra> From that same source:
[9777] <tantra> "The definition is thus:
[9778] <tantra> Not-knowing, training to liberate through knowing—the recognition of rigpa;
[9779] <tantra> The teacher who connects to Dzogchen meaning is the display of one's own mind;
[9780] <tantra> The student's definition is thus:
[9781] <tantra> Training through listening in undistracted manner—the undivided attention of awareness;
[9782] <tantra> The vessel for instruction is the mind itself, unbroken.
[9783] <tantra> Thus, meaning-endowed teacher and student
[9784] <tantra> Abide equally upon the ground of rigpa; || 80 ||
[9785] <tantra> If possessing samaya—the recognition that keeper and kept are one—thus it is."
[9786] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9787] The benefit of guarding samaya is:
[9788] <tantra> From that same source:
[9789] <tantra> "Abiding in samaya and vow as taught—
[9790] <tantra> Abiding in the recognition that samaya is spontaneously perfect—
[9791] <tantra> All intentions reach their culmination in the expanse of Dharmakaya."
[9792] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[9793] <tantra> From the Magical Illusion:
[9794] <tantra> "Whoever abides in supreme samaya—the unbroken continuum of rigpa, || 90 ||
[9795] <tantra> By the supreme, most supreme—the self-arisen wisdom,
[9796] <tantra> Sons and siblings are blessed in the intention of the natural state."
[9797] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9798] The fault of samaya decline is:
[9799] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[9800] <tantra> "If declined—if the recognition of rigpa is forgotten—both will burn in samsara's confusion;
[9801] <tantra> If body samaya declines—the Nirmanakaya's display is obscured,
[9802] <tantra> One burns in great vajra hell—the torment of not recognizing one's own nature,
[9803] <tantra> Born in the place of wailing cries—the suffering of delusion.
[9804] <tantra> If the teacher declines, without purification method— || 100 ||
[9805] <tantra> Both are born in great wailing-cry, forgetting the unbroken continuum.
[9806] <tantra> If the student declines, purification method exists—the re-recognition of rigpa."
[9807] <tantra> If speech samaya declines—the Sambhogakaya's display is obscured,
[9808] <tantra> Appearances cease to be meaningful, and
[9809] <tantra> One is born in the place of great darkness dust—the confusion of ignorance.
[9810] <tantra> Although emerging from that,
[9811] <tantra> One becomes born among the mute—not expressing the Dharma.
[9812] <tantra> If mind samaya declines—the Dharmakaya's recognition is lost,
[9813] <tantra> One is born in the place of great mind-disturbance, || 110 ||
[9814] <tantra> Always quarreling, continuum unceasing—the distraction of delusion,
[9815] <tantra> Fighting, suffering, great—
[9816] <tantra> Or one becomes without mindfulness—forgetting rigpa,
[9817] <tantra> Or mindfulness becomes dull—weak recognition,
[9818] <tantra> Madness-demon sickness strikes—the obstacles of confusion;
[9819] <tantra> Finally, born in the wailing-cry place—samsara without end."
[9820] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[9821] <tantra> Regarding early signs of deteriorated samaya:
[9822] <tantra> Unhappiness, various aspects arise—recognition wavers;
[9823] <tantra> Epidemic, harming diseases, and
[9824] <tantra> Fever-diseases various arise—the energies of confusion. || 120 ||
[9825] <tantra> Spirits and misleading ones also—the maras of distraction,
[9826] <ornament> —
[9827] <tantra> Kill sentient beings—the compassion of rigpa forgotten,
[9828] <tantra> Go to hell—the state of non-recognition.
[9829] <tantra> Eyes not see form—the vision of wisdom obscured.
[9830] <tantra> Ears hearing and actions not accomplished—the Dharma not practiced.
[9831] <tantra> Leprosy and itch diseases arise—the defilements of confusion.
[9832] <tantra> Thieves, king's punishment arise—the loss of natural wealth.
[9833] <tantra> Others, non-existent fever-disease arises—suffering without cause.
[9834] <tantra> Children and wife die—compassion and means are lost.
[9835] <tantra> Lands all, enemies rise, and || 130 ||
[9836] <tantra> Done, meaningless great becomes—activity without recognition."
[9837] <tantra> Thus.
[9838] If deteriorated, from three repair methods—the re-recognition of rigpa:
[9839] First, the body deteriorated repair method is.
[9840] <tantra> Also from that same source:
[9841] <tantra> "Scripture extensively read—the Dharma of the natural state,
[9842] <tantra> Ganacakra extensively turned—the offering of spontaneous presence,
[9843] <tantra> Three-circles correctly done—perceiver, perceived, and action liberated in their own place."
[9844] <tantra> Thus.
[9845] Speech also from that, || 140 ||
[9846] <tantra> That also purification method thus:
[9847] <tantra> "Lamp hundred ritual—the illumination of recognition,
[9848] <tantra> Confess-repair hundred recite—the purification of non-recognition,
[9849] <tantra> Confession aspect various do—admitting one has strayed from rigpa.
[9850] <tantra> That purified quality see—the recognition re-arisen."
[9851] <tantra> Thus.
[9852] <tantra> Confess-repair is Naraka continuous-confession—the confession that non-recognition itself is empty.
[9853] Mind also from that same source,
[9854] <tantra> That also purification method thus:
[9855] <tantra> "Teacher please, substance offer—the offering of recognition, || 150 ||
[9856] <tantra> Wealth-accumulation whatever exists, noble offer—all phenomena offered to the mandala of awareness.
[9857] <tantra> Thus confession done if,
[9858] <tantra> Thought all accomplish become—the spontaneous activity of wisdom,
[9859] <tantra> Desire all fulfill become—the natural satisfaction of the mind,
[9860] <tantra> Action all complete become—the effortless completion of the four kayas."
[9861] <tantra> Thus.
[9862] The protection method is:
[9863] <tantra> Fault quality see—seeing non-virtue as self-liberated, mindfulness and awareness pure continuum bind is.
[9864] <tantra> From that same source:
[9865] <tantra> "As-it-is abide in samaya— || 160 ||
[9866] <tantra> Even one aeon, not abandon if—abide in the unbroken continuum,
[9867] <tantra> Samaya great's protection method—the recognition of rigpa never parted from."
[9868] <tantra> Thus.
[9869] <tantra> That also teacher continuum and samaya's sequence know, ten protect—ten wisdoms.
[9870] <tantra> Student not-know, teacher's command protect—abide in the unbroken samaya.
[9871] <tantra> Know ten are:
[9872] <list> Word-meaning's place know—the Dharma of the natural state, and
[9873] <list> Question's answer expound know—the display of spontaneous wisdom, and || 170 ||
[9874] <list> Empowerment and instruction occasion know—the ripening of recognition, and
[9875] <list> View extensive know—the vast expanse of Dharmakaya, and
[9876] <list> Meditate state great know—the non-meditation of rigpa, and
[9877] <list> Reality profound know—the depths of the mind's nature, and
[9878] <list> Samsara with not-mix know—samsara and nirvana as equality, and
[9879] <list> Transcend ground at abide know—beyond all bases and ground, and
[9880] <list> Self and general Dharma and Dharma-possessor characteristic know is—the self-liberation of all phenomena.
[9881] <tantra> Also from that same source:
[9882] <tantra> That also protection method thus is:
[9883] <tantra> "Know one distinction—the recognition of rigpa, || 180 ||
[9884] <tantra> Distinction ten protection method superior—the complete display of wisdom.
[9885] <tantra> One at that from less is—the minimum is recognition itself.
[9886] <tantra> Samaya king that like engage—abide in the unbroken continuum of awareness."
[9887] <tantra> Thus it is.
[9888] Two: Body-Speech-Mind samaya specific explain is—the three kayas' natural display.
[9889] <tantra> From the Consequence:
[9890] <tantra> "Empowerment at depend, samaya explain—samaya as the unbroken continuum.
[9891] <tantra> Specific express not-capable although—beyond expression,
[9892] <tantra> Briefly body and speech and mind—the three kayas' display,
[9893] <tantra> Yoga body speech mind at apply—the natural yoga of the three gates.
[9894] <tantra> Focus teacher vajra sibling—the mandala of awareness,
[9895] <tantra> Protect place distinguish—abide in the natural state. || 190 ||
[9896] <tantra> Vow body and empowerment gather—the unbroken continuum of recognition.
[9897] <tantra> Vajra secret place hold should is—abide in the mind's own essence."
[9898] <tantra> Thus speak meaning demonstrate at body samaya—the Nirmanakaya's spontaneous display, and
[9899] <tantra> Speech samaya—the Sambhogakaya's unceasing voice, and
[9900] <tantra> Mind samaya three from—the Dharmakaya's self-recognition,
[9901] <prose> The three samayas are not kept but naturally present as the three kayas' self-display. Not the imposition of discipline but the recognition of what is already spontaneously perfect. Samaya is rigpa's unbroken continuum—not a rule to follow but the nature of mind itself, ceaselessly displaying. || 200 ||
