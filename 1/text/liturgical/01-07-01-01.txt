[9704] <prose><tantra> From the Tantra of Supreme Samaya:
[9705] <prose><tantra> "Samaya is the binding pledge—
[9706] <prose><tantra> The vajra cross, difficult to traverse, certain in aim."
[9707] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9708] Regarding the definition:
[9709] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9710] <prose><tantra> "Generally, that which is called samaya
[9711] <prose><tantra> Is the mind itself, unbroken,
[9712] <prose><tantra> Free from all deception and guile."
[9713] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9714] If classified according to the general system of Mantra,
[9715] There are two: root samaya and branch samaya.
[9716] The root consists of the three: Body, Speech, and Mind.
[9717] The branches are twenty-five,
[9718] To be known thus:
[9719] <list> To accept,
[9720] <list> Not to abandon,
[9721] <list> To practice,
[9722] <list> To accomplish—
[9723] Here, if classified specifically,
[9724] <list> View,
[9725] <list> Conduct,
[9726] <list] Practice,
[9727] <list> Common,
[9728] <list> Particular Body-Speech-Mind,
[9729] <ornament> Branches,
[9730] <list> And crucial, certain samaya—
[9731] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[9732] <prose><tantra> "The hundred-thousand-fold spoken samayas,
[9733] <prose><tantra> Briefly taught—well hold these in mind."
[9734] <prose><tantra> Their brief teaching is this:
[9735] <verse> "The samaya of realizing view,
[9736] <verse> The samaya of tantric conduct,
[9737] <verse> The samaya of general practice,
[9738] <verse> The samaya of general commonality,
[9739] <verse> The samaya of Body-Speech-Mind,
[9740] <verse> The samaya of branch enumerations,
[9741] <verse> And the crucial, certain samaya."
[9742] These and other samayas
[9743] Are extensively summarized, great in scope.
[9744] Thus it is spoken.
[9745] The basis is teacher and student, vajra siblings.
[9746] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9747] <prose><tantra> "Inconceivable are these samayas,
[9748] <prose><tantra> Spoken to gather in two aspects:
[9749] <prose><tantra> Teacher and student, these two—
[9750] <prose><tantra> The cause of protection, universally renowned.
[9751] <prose><tantra> The cause of protection is the teacher;
[9752] <prose><tantra> The one who makes protection is the student."
[9753] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9754] The vajra siblings are also ascertained as four.
[9755] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9756] <prose><tantra> "To the vajra sibling, four meanings are taught:
[9757] <prose><tantra> General, close, mixed, and
[9758] <prose><tantra> Mandala-vase-mixed."
[9759] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9760] Moreover, all who have entered the teachings in general, and specifically all who have entered Secret Mantra, are general siblings.
[9761] Those of one Dharma-family are close siblings.
[9762] Those gathered by one Guru are mixed siblings.
[9763] Those upon whom a single empowerment has been bestowed at one time, in one mandala, with one lamp, one vase—these are extremely mixed siblings.
[9764] These should also be known to become objects of sevenfold strictness.
[9765] Regarding the teacher, there is the general teacher honored by all as teacher, and
[9766] The teacher who draws one to connect with the Dharma oneself,
[9767] The teacher who bestows samaya and vows, the empowerment teacher,
[9768] The teacher who gives instruction and transmission—thus four.
[9769] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9770] <prose><tantra> "Regarding the teacher, four meanings exist:
[9771] <prose><tantra> General, drawing, samaya-empowerment,
[9772] <prose><tantra> Instruction-transmission teacher."
[9773] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9774] The definition of teacher and student is also:
[9775] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9776] <prose><tantra> "The definition is thus:
[9777] <prose><tantra> Not-knowing, training to liberate through knowing—
[9778] <prose><tantra> The teacher who connects to Dzogchen meaning;
[9779] <prose><tantra> The student's definition is thus:
[9780] <prose><tantra> Training through listening in undistracted manner—
[9781] <prose><tantra> The vessel for instruction.
[9782] <prose><tantra> Thus, meaning-endowed teacher and student
[9783] <prose><tantra> Abide equally upon right ground;
[9784] <prose><tantra> If possessing samaya, thus it is."
[9785] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9786] The benefit of guarding samaya is:
[9787] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9788] <prose><tantra> "Abiding in samaya and vow as taught,
[9789] <prose><tantra> Whatever abides in samaya—
[9790] <prose><tantra> All intentions reach their culmination."
[9791] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[9792] <prose><tantra> From the Magical Illusion:
[9793] <prose><tantra> "Whoever abides in supreme samaya,
[9794] <prose><tantra> By the supreme, most supreme,
[9795] <prose><tantra> Sons and siblings are blessed in intention."
[9796] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9797] The fault of samaya decline is:
[9798] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[9799] <prose><tantra> "If declined, both will burn;
[9800] <prose><tantra> If body samaya declines,
[9801] <prose><tantra> One burns in great vajra hell,
[9802] <prose><tantra> Born in the place of wailing cries.
[9803] <prose><tantra> If the teacher declines, without purification method,
[9804] <prose><tantra> Both are born in great wailing-cry.
[9805] <prose><tantra> If the student declines, purification method exists."
[9806] <prose><tantra> If speech samaya declines,
[9807] <prose><tantra> Appearances cease to be, and
[9808] <prose><tantra> One is born in the place of great darkness dust.
[9809] <prose><tantra> Although emerging from that,
[9810] <prose><tantra> One becomes born among the mute.
[9811] <prose><tantra> If mind samaya declines,
[9812] <prose><tantra> One is born in the place of great mind-disturbance,
[9813] <prose><tantra> Always quarreling, continuum unceasing,
[9814] <prose><tantra> Fighting, suffering, great—
[9815] <prose><tantra> Or one becomes without mindfulness,
[9816] <prose><tantra> Or mindfulness becomes dull,
[9817] <prose><tantra> Madness-demon sickness strikes;
[9818] <prose><tantra> Finally, born in the wailing-cry place."
[9819] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[9820] <prose><tantra> Regarding early signs of deteriorated samaya:
[9821] <prose><tantra> Unhappiness, various aspects arise;
[9822] <prose><tantra> Epidemic, harming diseases, and
[9823] <prose><tantra> Fever-diseases various arise.
[9824] <prose><tantra> Spirits and misleading ones also,
[9825] <ornament> —
[9826] <prose><tantra> Kill sentient beings, go to hell.
[9827] <prose><tantra> Eyes not see form.
[9828] <prose><tantra> Ears hearing and actions not accomplished.
[9829] <prose><tantra> Leprosy and itch diseases arise.
[9830] <prose><tantra> Thieves, king's punishment arise.
[9831] <prose><tantra> Others, non-existent fever-disease arises.
[9832] <prose><tantra> Children and wife die—shown.
[9833] <prose><tantra> Lands all, enemies rise, and
[9834] <prose><tantra> Done, meaningless great becomes."
[9835] <prose><tantra> Thus.
[9836] If deteriorated, from three repair methods:
[9837] First, the body deteriorated repair method is.
[9838] <prose><tantra> Also from that same source:
[9839] <prose><tantra> "Scripture extensively read, and
[9840] <prose><tantra> Ganacakra extensively turned,
[9841] <prose><tantra> Three-circles correctly done"—thus spoken.
[9842] <prose><tantra> Thus.
[9843] Speech also from that,
[9844] <prose><tantra> That also purification method thus:
[9845] <prose><tantra> "Lamp hundred ritual, and
[9846] <prose><tantra> Confess-repair hundred recite, and
[9847] <prose><tantra> Confession aspect various do.
[9848] <prose><tantra> That purified quality see."
[9849] <prose><tantra> Thus.
[9850] <prose><tantra> Confess-repair is Naraka continuous-confession.
[9851] Mind also from that same source,
[9852] <prose><tantra> That also purification method thus:
[9853] <prose><tantra> "Teacher please, substance offer,
[9854] <prose><tantra> Wealth-accumulation whatever exists, noble offer.
[9855] <prose><tantra> Thus confession done if,
[9856] <prose><tantra> Thought all accomplish become,
[9857] <prose><tantra> Desire all fulfill become,
[9858] <prose><tantra> Action all complete become."
[9859] <prose><tantra> Thus.
[9860] The protection method is:
[9861] <prose><tantra> Fault quality see, mindfulness and awareness pure continuum bind is.
[9862] <prose><tantra> From that same source:
[9863] <prose><tantra> "As-it-is abide in samaya;
[9864] <prose><tantra> Even one aeon, not abandon if—
[9865] <prose><tantra> Samaya great's protection method."
[9866] <prose><tantra> Thus.
[9867] <prose><tantra> That also teacher continuum and samaya's sequence know, ten protect.
[9868] <prose><tantra> Student not-know, teacher's command protect.
[9869] <prose><tantra> Know ten are:
[9870] <list> Word-meaning's place know, and
[9871] <list> Question's answer expound know, and
[9872] <list> Empowerment and instruction occasion know, and
[9873] <list> View extensive know, and
[9874] <list> Meditate state great know, and
[9875] <list> Reality profound know, and
[9876] <list> Samsara with not-mix know, and
[9877] <list> Transcend ground at abide know, and
[9878] <list> Self and general Dharma and Dharma-possessor characteristic know is.
[9879] <prose><tantra> Also from that same source:
[9880] <prose><tantra> That also protection method thus is:
[9881] <prose><tantra> "Know one distinction,
[9882] <prose><tantra> Distinction ten protection method superior.
[9883] <prose><tantra> One at that from less is.
[9884] <prose><tantra> Samaya king that like engage."
[9885] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[9886] Two: Body-Speech-Mind samaya specific explain is.
[9887] <prose><tantra> From the Consequence:
[9888] <prose><tantra> "Empowerment at depend, samaya explain.
[9889] <prose><tantra> Specific express not-capable although,
[9890] <prose><tantra> Briefly body and speech and mind,
[9891] <prose><tantra> Yoga body speech mind at apply.
[9892] <prose><tantra> Focus teacher vajra sibling,
[9893] <prose><tantra> Protect place distinguish.
[9894] <prose><tantra> Vow body and empowerment gather.
[9895] <prose><tantra> Vajra secret place hold should is."
[9896] <prose><tantra> Thus speak meaning demonstrate at body samaya and
[9897] <prose><tantra> Speech samaya and
[9898] <prose><tantra> Mind samaya three from,
