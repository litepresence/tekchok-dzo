[5963] Introducing changeless wisdom, direct copper-shining, intention of exhausted dharmas beyond mind.
[5964] Cutting the path to great nameless samsara-nirvana in the manner without binding, freeing, accepting, or rejecting—all primordially transcended in the vast expanse of spontaneous equality.
[5965] First has three:
[5966] General explanation of the meaning, sky-like, without doing, in the nature of great perfection.
[5967] Cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind, without binding or freeing.
[5968] Vastly pervading the great equality of six aggregates, mirror of mind's object-vision.
[5969] First:
[5970] Great primordially empty, completely empty: all dharmas included by samsara-nirvana, outer vision, inner awareness, middle grasping, holding, vision, and signs.
[5971] Great empty by mind's vision-emptiness.
[5972] Great empty by purity, empty by freedom. || 10 ||

[5995] Pervasively-vast, primordially buddha-ed;
[5996] Spontaneously-equal, expanse buddha-ed;

[6003] Unthinking;

[6011] Before: not experiencing freedom;
[6012] Now: not entering freedom; || 50 ||
[6013] End: freedom impossible.
[6014] Before: no transcendence;

[6017] Limitless, leveled-buddha, empty;

[6019] Is-manner path non-existent;
[6020] Free-manner result non-existent.

[6025] Primordially buddha-ed, beyond action-effort;
[6026] Vastly buddha-ed, beyond view-meditation.
[6027] Freely buddha-ed, beyond reference and thought;
[6028] Cutting the path to nameless buddhahood everywhere, in all directions.

[6057] Primordially equal, leveled-vast, original, nameless.
[6058] Whatever vision, abiding as primordially buddha-ed without basis from the ground—bind-free effort self-ceases.
[6059] Whatever dawn, everywhere limitlessly level-placed, primordially pure, self-empty, vastly.
[6060] Whatever buddha-ed, interior vastness of self-mind without doing, effort ceasing everywhere without equal level, abiding as primordially empty and self-pure without trace.
[6061] Applying scripture to the meaning realized by oneself—all dharmas primordially self-dawning in the abide-manner of great perfection nature.
[6062] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra: || 100 ||
[6063] The nature of great perfection:
[6064] All meanings enter the center of mind;
[6065] Non-vision, objectless, without conceptuality,
[6066] Uncut, naturally cutting at self-ground.
[6067] Non-awareness of not experiencing delusion severed,
[6068] Unexamined, primordially cutting, abiding.
[6069] Above, who has not felt all this?
[6070] All these coarse elements also,
[6071] Naturally ceasing from the first,
[6072] Without place to go, naturally going, || 110 ||
[6073] Self-body primordially non-existent,
[6074] Known here without before or after.
[6075] All this, timeless, vastly timed,
[6076] By one, two, and six-three:
[6077] Non-vision, vision, and half-vision,
[6078] In self-sound of non-vision doing,
[6079] Exceeding ground-holding ground.
[6080] Who has not felt primordial abiding?
[6081] Path without primordial traverse,
[6082] This path primordially near, || 120 ||
[6083] This also primordially abiding from self,
[6084] Not seen before—dull self-knowing.
[6085] Intention of non-abiding samadhi:
[6086] Primordially abiding without meditation.
[6087] This also: who did not know before?
[6088] The object of attachment to self and grasping:
[6089] From the very first, in dharmata,
[6090] All this self-vision by self—
[6091] Not knowing primordial vision before.
[6092] Five afflictions binding self-concept, || 130 ||
[6093] Primordially self-dawning awareness,
[6094] Abiding together, faces not meeting.
[6095] Four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—
[6096] Primordially self-body,
[6097] Dull eye of whoever has not seen.
[6098] Very secret gathering place, speech-essence,
[6099] Self-sounding without interval.
[6100] Whoever has not heard this itself—
[6101] Does ear-power not exist?
[6102] Self-abiding expanse and awareness-scent, || 140 ||
[6103] Self-samsara without occasion to separate.
[6104] Nose ceased from not experiencing feeling?
[6105] Three essences, one coiled instruction-taste,
[6106] Primordially body-mind essence—
[6107] Tongue cut from not experiencing this?
[6108] Self-pure vision, color-ornament,
[6109] Without separating from self-body,
[6110] Like body and shadow,
[6111] Abiding without day or night.
[6112] Inert body, untouched by anyone? || 150 ||
[6113] Dharma of bliss striking suffering everywhere,
[6114] Self-abiding without forgetting.
[6115] Dull mind of whoever has not known.
[6116] Piling again the latencies of samsara,
[6117] Primordially abiding as dharmakaya—
[6118] The place of compassion, unseen by whoever.
[6119] From self-concept object's dawning at powers,
[6120] Various memories, thoughts, and movements,
[6121] Primordially self-dawning as Sambhogakaya—
[6122] Worried forgetting, not remembering all this. || 160 ||
[6123] Do, doer, conduct, effort, accomplishment, and
[6124] All noise of gathered beings
[6125] Primordially as emanation body—
[6126] Dull capability of whoever has not known.
[6127] How thoughts and memories move,
[6128] Like a river's flow, without interval,
[6129] Always attracting self-mind.
[6130] Effortless self-place meditation—
[6131] Straying mind, not understanding experience.
[6132] This vision hearing existing container-contents, || 170 ||
[6133] Although natureless through examination,
[6134] Like cutting the continuum of village-city,
[6135] Not seeing primordial abiding.
[6136] Doors of powers closed?
[6137] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6138]
[6139] This nature of delusion-vision—
[6140] Not seen before as wisdom,
[6141] From basis of delusion with concept not existing,
[6142] Realizing all-ground as great dharmakaya, || 180 ||
[6143] Delusion's self-concept continuum ceases.
[6144] Thus, non-deluded vision
[6145] Arises from the split vital point primordially.
[6146] Buddha-body of beings' aggregates,
[6147] Primordially existing—who did not know?
[6148] Aggregates as Buddha-lord,
[6149] Arising from letters abiding in channels.
[6150] Wisdom in bubbles and eyes—
[6151] Who has not seen as self-vision?
[6152] From the Mu tig phreng ba: || 190 ||
[6153] Regarding nature-vision dharmas:
[6154] Subtle and coarse reversed through non-defilement;
[6155] Delusion reversed through non-grasping-holding;
[6156] Action-wind reversed through non-movement;
[6157] Entity reversed through copper-shining;
[6158] Emptiness reversed through clarity;
[6159] Generation stage reversed through primordial realization;
[6160] Conduct reversed through non-effort;
[6161] Meditation reversed through non-seeking placement;
[6162] Vision reversed through self-freedom; || 200 ||
[6163] View reversed through manifest vision;
[6164] Terms reversed through non-sound-words;
[6165] Attachment reversed through not experiencing existence;
[6166] Other-dependence reversed through not experiencing non-existence;
[6167] Mental examination reversed through non-grasping;
[6168] Number-end reversed through uniqueness;
[6169] Other arising and ceasing through all-pervading.
[6170] Darkness buddha-ed through self-dawning;
[6171] Dharmakaya pervading through essence;
[6172] Sambhogakaya expanding through clear vision; || 210 ||
[6173] Emanation body arising through mother-child meeting;
[6174] Method arising through existent realization;
[6175] Memory buddha-ed through thought-exceeding;
[6176] Establishment view complete through non-eternal-cut.
[6177] Again:
[6178] Exceeding ground, direction, and limit;
[6179] Non-existent existence, non-existence, and like-vision;
[6180] Not activity-field of all sounds and measures;
[6181] No field of counting one, two.
[6182] Accomplished by descending into great emptiness; || 220 ||
[6183] Not activity-field of scripture and reason;
[6184] Not indicated by tantra and instruction.
[6185] Through view, meditation, and conduct,
[6186] That meaning will not be known.
[6187] That meaning: no accomplishment as result;
[6188] Dharmas obscure that itself.
[6189] Not accomplished by thinking;
[6190] Not to be examined even by wisdom.
[6191] Through giving, ethics, and patience,
[6192] That itself separate from harm-benefit result. || 230 ||
[6193] Through hearing, thinking, and meditation,
[6194] Not seeing that, even examining supreme.
[6195] No mandala therein;
[6196] No deity, no generation seed;
[6197] What to do with mantra and mudra?
[6198] No need to elaborate offerings, etc.;
[6199] Where are power and vow?
[6200] No approach or accomplishment;
[6201] No wheel emanation;
[6202] No protection, no protectable field; || 240 ||
[6203] Exceeding harm and obstacle fields.
[6204]
[6205]
[6206]
[6207] From the Self-Dawning:
[6208] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6209] No view, meditation, or conduct.
[6210] Yet hold well-taught in mind.
[6211] Without accomplishing, without wishing to move ability,
[6212] The meaning of that itself, spontaneously complete without doing, as before. || 250 ||
[6213] Where are doings and doers?
[6214] This self-arisen dharmata without conduct,
[6215] Not falling in any direction, like space,
[6216] Not existence—only oneness of emptiness,
[6217] Not non-existence—true bliss body,
[6218] Not made—self-arisen, concept-free.
[6219] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6220] Where is dharmata of meditation?
[6221] Dharma without sending or keeping,
[6222] Free from end of meditated and non-meditated. || 260 ||
[6223] What defilement of hold-free mind?
[6224] True awareness without defilement;
[6225] Upon stainless pure dharmakaya,
[6226] Nothing to meditate or be meditated.
[6227] Not finding true itself by meditating;
[6228] If found, self-awareness becomes non-existent.
[6229] Why? In self-awareness wisdom,
[6230] Without distracted or non-distracted.
[6231] Where there is holding,
[6232] Self-arisen wisdom does not exist. || 270 ||
[6233] That also: dharmas thus:
[6234] No ceasing from non-birth;
[6235] Free at self-place from non-holding;
[6236] No elaboration from non-reference;
[6237] Existing in all, not arisen from making;
[6238] Fully pure expanse through unconditioned;
[6239] Term of holding separate from dharmas;
[6240] Separate from expression through non-nature.
[6241] From the Nor bu phra bkod:
[6242] Ha ha! || 280 ||
[6243] Dharmata arising from non-dharma;
[6244] Object-like vision from non-object;
[6245] Dharma-free wisdom interiorly clear,
[6246] Memoryless: non-existent as object.
[6247] From the Seng ge rtsal rdzogs:
[6248] This entity-free dharmata without holding-attachment,
[6249] Supreme non-dual intention of all Buddhas.
[6250] Discrimination and marks, path of words,
[6251] Self-place pure dharmata without action-effort,
[6252] Ub chub samadhi entering dharmata-object. || 290 ||
[6253] Pure and impure terms non-existent as dharmas;
[6254] Primordially abiding meaning exceeding one and two,
[6255] Ub by one bindu in the manner of self-body.
[6256]
[6257]
[6258]
[6259]
[6260]
[6261] From the Klong drug pa:
[6262] No reference in endless center; || 300 ||
[6263] No thinking, no objects;
[6264] No deity, no mantra either;
[6265] Beyond all designation of non-dharma;
[6266] No enemy, no friend either;
[6267] No body, no vision to powers;
[6268] Dharmas not visible by thinking;
[6269] No holding of what is non-existent where;
[6270] No I, no possessions of I;
[6271] No expanse, no awareness body either;
[6272] No ripening of virtue or evil; || 310 ||
[6273] No life, no reference to cut;
[6274] No collection, no field to accumulate;
[6275] No Buddha, no beings;
[6276] No abiding, no emptiness either.
[6277] From Samantabhadra's Mind Mirror:
[6278] To enlightenment essence without deviation or obstacle,
[6279] Where is holding deviation and obstacle?
[6280] Completely non-existent: deviation-free obstacles.
[6281] To dharmakaya separate from obstacles,
[6282] Holding deviation-obstacle as two is afflicted. || 320 ||
[6283] To unborn dharmakaya arising from self,
[6284] Capability-delusion of hoping to come from other.
[6285] To unborn awareness separate from thought,
[6286] Oh wonder, shown in words and letters!
[6287] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6288] Where is doer of unmade?
[6289] No lord of unfabricated fabrication;
[6290] Separate from view-doing dharmas of non-view;
[6291] Fully clear see-doer of non-seeing;
[6292] Separate from appear-direction of non-appear-doer; || 330 ||
[6293] Pervading ten directions, untouchable, of non-writing;
[6294] Separate from effort-accomplish dharmas of non-effort;
[6295] Separate from many dharmas of non-oneness;
[6296] Clear without outer-inner of non-outer-inner.
[6297] Also from the Common Secret Illusion:
[6298] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6299] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6300] All born from unborn,
[6301] Unborn from merely born.
[6302] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma! || 340 ||
[6303] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6304] All abiding from non-abiding,
[6305] Non-abiding from merely abiding.
[6306] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6307] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
[6308] Going and coming from non-going-coming,
[6309] Non-going-coming from going-coming itself.
[6310]
[6311]
[6312] || 350 ||
[6313]
[6314] Also from the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6315] The Thus-Come always born,
[6316] Non-dharma,
[6317] All dharmas like the Blissfully-Come.
[6318] Childish intellects holding marks,
[6319] Practicing non-existent dharmas in the pure world.
[6320] Also from the Samadhiraja Sutra:
[6321] When this world realm arises and
[6322] Ceases after arising, abiding empty, || 360 ||
[6323] Like before, so also after—
[6324] Know all dharmas thus.
[6325] From the Arya Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6326] Non-awareness like space,
[6327] All dharmas without characteristics,
[6328] Without support, without abiding, without taking—
[6329] Fully know as like emanations.
[6330] From the Guhyasamaja:
[6331] These entities unborn,
[6332] Dharma and dharmata non-existent, || 370 ||
[6333] Selfless like space—
[6334] This manner of enlightenment shown.
[6335] Second: two parts regarding cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind without binding or freeing:
[6336] General explanation through examining three goings of arising-places, and
[6337] Particular certainty through examining one and different.
[6338] First:
[6339] Although essence is end-free like space,
[6340] Without inner examination by self, remaining in thought "is," going like a darkness-stone through empty meditation,
[6341] Through not thinking copper-shining directly, not separating the difference-edge of samsara-nirvana,
[6342] Need discriminating wisdom for realization dawning as certain knowledge. || 380 ||
[6343] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6344] Although awareness nature pervades all,
[6345] Said to reach dharma instruction.
[6346] Here, to be realized through guru's instruction, three parts:
[6347] Examining arising-place and arising-agent;
[6348] Examining abiding-place and abiding-agent;
[6349] Examining going-place and going-agent.
[6350] First, from the two:
[6351] Arising place: outer various objects appearing,
[6352] Inner: aggregates appearing as form. || 390 ||
[6353]
[6354]
[6355]
[6356]
[6357] When either of those two minds dawns:
[6358] Dawned outward: outer object;
[6359] Dawned inward: inner body.
[6360] Examining dust-particles without parts, dividing layer by layer,
[6361] Seeing arising-place's vision-object non-existent, recognizing mind did not arise from that—cutting connection to great root-free basis of concept holding grasped object.
[6362] If arising-agent sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mental-events arise from themselves, momentary knowing becomes two substances; || 400 ||
[6363] Examining complete: not arising from self or other.
[6364] Now, thinking that arising-place arises self-arisen:
[6365] Color,
[6366] Shape,
[6367] Sign,
[6368] Characteristic,
[6369] Big-small,
[6370] Direction-part, etc.—examining what exists, not abiding anywhere.
[6371] Merely mind-examined, basisless, gone everywhere primordially pure,
[6372] Inner holding-concept, basisless like sky, realized by self, || 410 ||
[6373] All grasping-holding appearing as dharma and dharmata, realized at that time as great support-free without object.
[6374] Realizing today mind's primordial non-arising at first—understanding meaning of great elaboration-free dharmakaya.
[6375] Second: middle abiding-place and abiding-agent.
[6376] Third: likewise destroying and examining end going-place and going-agent two,
[6377] Touching intention of great self-luminous Sambhogakaya and
[6378] Self-free self-dawning emanation body.
[6379] Outer-inner objectless, unsupported awareness;
[6380] Grasping-holding basisless;
[6381] Understanding meaning of equal intention without interval.
[6382] Self-buddha great equality dawning interiorly as unmeditated river-flow samadhi. || 420 ||
[6383] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6384] Mind: first arising place,
[6385] Middle abiding place, end going place.
[6386] Thus examining and analyzing the three,
[6387] Purify mind, know mind's abiding manner.
[6388] At that time, all outer object-vision non-existent, suddenly basisless vision;
[6389] All inner mind-concepts dawn-free, without trace.
[6390]
[6391] Called "dawning in mind-exhaustion the intention of dharma-exhaustion" through seeing great copper-shining without connection between vision and mind.
[6392] These are said in the Arya Ratnakuta: || 430 ||
[6393] Kashyapa, herein bodhisattvas mahasattvas begin the diligence of fully searching mind.
[6394] That mind is not observed outwardly,
[6395] Not observed inwardly,
[6396] Not existing and not observed in the interval of both.
[6397] Not blue,
[6398] Not yellow, and so forth.
[6399] Supreme among all diligences to that is the diligence of fully searching mind—thus said.
[6400] Second: examining one and different—
[6401] The instruction of destroying mind's house.
[6402] Moreover: if this called "mind" exists, from what cause does it arise? || 440 ||
[6403] If non-existent, what are this movement and memory-knowing wheel?
[6404] Upon what condition do these memory-knowing aspects depend to arise?
[6405] Without condition, these sudden memory-knowings are unsuitable.
[6406] If this mind exists as one with body, it would also be destroyed when body is destroyed;
[6407] If non-existent, with uncertain following-return, body-sickness would come to mind.
[6408] Unsuitable for before-after birth wheel to come.
[6409] If "mind" here is one, through one realm's powers ceasing, other realms should also die;
[6410] If not one, realm minds should differ like realm forms differ; if different, all those insects and beings inside one body
[6411] Should live when one person's life-time is done.
[6412] If one, what is this coming of numberless outer-inner beings to one body? || 450 ||
[6413] If this mind has a returning place,
