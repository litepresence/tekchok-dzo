[635] From the south-eastern direction of this world system,
[636] Beyond the six transcendent realms,
[637] The realm called Thal-ba resounds:
[638] Protectors and benefactors completely surround it,
[639] Victory banners, parasols, and royal insignia raised on high,
[640] Flowers of many kinds, fragrant rains, and perfumes descend,
[641] Upon the Teacher himself and upon his teachings,
[642] The assembly of beautifying goddesses and their reflections encircle them,
[643] And the play of bliss naturally arises.
[644] From the south-western direction of this world,
[645] From below the six transcendent realms, the wind of Thal-ba,
[646] Moves and stirs throughout the intermediate space,
[647] Moving in mutual embrace, hovering,
[648] And from this movement all sounds arise.
[649] The Teacher's teachings are moved by this wind,
[650] Through the three gateways of those possessing the five elements.
[651] Upon that summit, thirteen are stacked together—
[652] The Jewel Thal-ba, as it is called,
[653] Adorned with auspicious rays of the sun,
[654] And ornamented with the qualities of desire.
[655] Miraculous letters and beautiful script,
[656] The Teacher's teachings—complete in reflection.
[657] Beautiful through the lotus eyes of Lda-ldi,
[658] From this, the summit of the western-northern threshold.
[659] The sixth world-system,
[660] The Taming Thal-ba, as it is called.
[661] Together with goddesses making complete offerings,
[662] Filled with light and the fragrance of sandalwood,
[663] The Teacher's teachings—equal in every portion.
[664] Possessing beautiful forms of sixteen years,
[665] Surrounded by those in the bloom of youth.
[666] Below that, in the ninth world,
[667] The deity called Dung-ldan Thal-ba,
[668] Intoxicated by the fragrance of faith and protection,
[669] Turbulent, with extremely blazing light,
[670] Agitated, glowing with fierce intensity.
[671] The Teacher himself, his teachings,
[672] And his retinue—complete enjoyment.
[673] From this, the sixth world,
[674] The Star Thal-ba, as it is called.
[675] The nature of the stacked wheel,
[676] Completely stacked by fives and nines.
[677] Adorned with the water-spouts of dawn,
[678] Thunder, lightning, and red tongues emerge.
[679] The Teacher's teachings are surrounded by scripture,
[680] The light-arising garland—lineage of the nāgas.
[681] Illuminating all directions and thresholds.
[682] Thus.
[683] And in all those upper and lower thresholds of the twenty-five stacked lotus-abiding ones, countless fields pervade all upper and lower directions and thresholds.
[684] Like scattered stars.
[685] Thus from immeasurable fields,
[686] The sequence of this Sahā world is explained:
[687] From that itself:
[688] External elements arise from wind as well,
[689] Connected with the space element,
[690] Upon which rests water, and above that earth.
[691] In extent, breadth, and thickness equal,
[692] One hundred-thousand and four countless,
[693] One of which is four portions empty.
[694] The arrangement of continents and Mount Meru,
[695] Together with the wish-fulfilling tree and the jewel,
[696] The individual gods of sun and moon,
[697] Surrounded by the great ocean's method.
[698] Mountain ranges and water ranges,
[699] All definitely surrounded by seven jewels.
[700] Internally, thus from the first formless realm,
[701] The form realm is luminosity:
[702] In the distance, the desire realm as well,
[703] The stainless moon and
[704] The greatly illuminating sun,
[705] The world-systems expanded,
[706] Paranirmitavaśavartin and so forth in upper sequence.
[707] Then the abodes of asuras,
[708] The sequence of humans in the four continents.
[709] By kleśas together with self,
[710] The abodes of lower realms arise in sequence.
[711] Thus.
[712] From the Pearl Garland Tantra:
[713] In space, wind supports that water,
[714] By eleven hundred-thousands,
[715] Round and coiled, itself arisen.
[716] Like cream arising from milk,
[717] Earth is twelve hundred-thousands.
[718] Wind's number is one hundred-thousand.
[719] The wind gathers and contracts,
[720] Pulls and lifts.
[721] Water pervades and holds,
[722] Ripens—these three.
[723] Earth rubs subtle and
[724] Coarse itself—these three.
[725] Like that which is churned down below,
[726] Among mountains, the king of mountains is:
[727] Four terraces and great peaks,
[728] Seven sporting lakes and seven mountains,
[729] Continents and the surrounding rim arisen.
[730] The three-thousand and so forth world-systems.
[731] By desire, form, and formless,
[732] These three realms are supported there.
[733] The formless realm, without any existence,
[734] Without even slight consciousness,
[735] Arisen from that.
[736] The pure abodes and so forth embodied,
[737] From upper to lower in drops manner.
[738] Akanistha and so forth of desire.
[739] Gods, asuras, and humans:
[740] High, then from that the three abodes,
[741] Animals, pretas, and hell—
[742] These four kinds of birth for beings.
[743] That also, the humans of the first fortunate eon,
[744] Possessing form, youth, and marks of beauty,
[745] Their bodies pervaded by their own light's radiance,
[746] Desire-food and so forth as merit-food.
[747] The life of beings also eighty-thousand,
[748] Without male and female faculties.
[749] Then from the two causes of delusion,
[750] Kleśas of desire and so forth,
[751] Gradually became coarse.
[752] The faculties and so forth gates,
[753] Light and so forth decrease, for merit is exhausted.
[754] Then in sequence, earth oil and
[755] Sālu rice and so forth as food.
[756] Thus and so forth taught.
[757] Here that meaning is slightly shown definitively:
[758] Known from common sūtras and treatises, and
[759] Although much taught from uncommon tantra-sections regarding measure and arrangement,
[760] Here it is explained like the unsurpassed Vajra-peak vehicle.
[761] From the Great Array of Ati, arising like that, the meaning of entity-abiding established without mistake:
[762] In the space included within the category of Brahma-great's field,
[763] The fields abiding as twenty-five stacked three-thousand upon the center's layers of Gang-chen-tsho's hand-lotus,
[764] Are called the field ornamented by basis and essence with flowers,
[765] From inside that, to the arrangement of this Sahā world-system, the thirteenth secret-mantra vajra-vehicle field abiding at the glorious center's heart,
[766] The arising of the first fortunate eon,
[767] The abiding in the middle,
[768] The destruction at the end,
[769] The final emptying—these four should be known.
[770] First, arising: the container and
[771] The sequence of the essence, the sequence of the first arising of the container is:
[772] From the side of this, below from the passed twenty intermediate fortunate eons after the previously arisen world became empty,
[773] In empty space where five-colored seeds of elements not clear, yet capable of arising,
[774] In the upper direction, the formless realm called object-possessor of grasping consciousness, possessing portions of arising element seeds, arisen like essences upper-arisen in drops manner.
[775] In the lower direction, the manner of arising below like the terrace of a caitya is:
[776] The time of the first arising of container-contained,
[777] The lower basis called completely mind-joy, space possessing white color and white light,
[778] In the appearance of extremely white terraces,
[779] The seed E triangle, clear space supporting this three-thousand world, arisen.
[780] From that space, from the wind pervading, entering, and protecting called seed A, from the sound called Uṃ proclaimed three times:
[781] Namely, the wind of variously-stopping,
[782] Merely rises as the breath of a striped mouse,
[783] From gathered like mist or cloud-mass in sky,
[784] Marked by yaṃ at the navel, similar to the shape of various vajra-crosses,
[785] Four wind goddesses holding wind banners,
[786] Blazing various colored lights,
[787] Similar to the form of Indra-nila, green wind element,
[788] Formed vast and thick in height,
[789] Demonstrating power of raising and not rising until the eon,
[790] Four iron sows flung from four tips of vajra-cross,
[791] Depth of that wind: one hundred-thousand eight thousand leagues,
[792] Width: sixty hundred-thousand four hundred-thousand formed.
[793] Then forms called water's water thoroughly established:
[794] From gathered gold-essence clouds in upper sky,
[795] From fell stream of rain for seven years,
[796] To clear, unmoving, unturbid water, round shape similar to full moon,
[797] Formed with countless dancing water goddesses, depth eleven hundred-thousand twenty thousand leagues,
[798] Width three hundred-thousand five thousand leagues formed.
[799] Then at one intermediate eon, from below wind mandala,
[800] From arose possessing thoroughly pressing sound, called stopping-doing wind,
[801] Arose roaring sound floating upward from lower sky,
[802] From all mixed as one, wind and water etc. moved upward,
[803] Formed five thousand leagues gold ground like cream formed on milk, above water.
[804] Above that, called forming-doing earth's earth, formed five thousand measure from spread countless atoms.
[805] Above that, called time earth's fire, formed two hundred-thousand leagues from spread countless atoms.
[806] Then called separating-doing wind.
[807] From arisen like waves from ocean,
[808] Fell countless wind atoms from upper sky,
[809] Like example of snow fell in space.
[810] That itself formed one hundred-thousand leagues.
[811] Above that, called hollow-making earth's sky, blue like turquoise radiance,
[812] By fell countless sky atoms from sky,
[813] Those gathered as one,
[814] By action of doing nature,
[815] Like silk formed on ocean,
[816] Expanded and evenly flat,
[817] Four-cornered shape,
[818] Held by four earth goddesses holding four gold vases from four corners,
[819] Held by four powerful naga sons from four sides.
[820] That also height four hundred-thousand ten-thousand leagues.
[821] These element mandalas also
[822] Formed supported one on one like stupa tiers.
[823] From sutra, these between-between sky also explained demarcated intervals each that much measure of upper leagues.
[824] From Vajra-peak world arrangement,
[825] Between water and earth also called sky mind-protecting,
[826] Fire mandala depth one thousand leagues, raised by five thousand leagues, in center,
[827] Width five hundred-thousand,
[828] Possessing red light,
[829] Said to exist as action of ripening common elements.
[830] That also did action pervaded by earth's water,
[831] Showing distinction of beings' action.
[832] Ripened by earth's fire,
[833] Beings' body's color clear.
[834] Made atom by earth's wind,
[835] Make beings' sense-powers complete.
[836] Did action opened aperture by earth's sky,
[837] Make beings' mind abide.
[838] Pressed by earth's earth,
[839] Make beings' action and merit show.
[840] These called vessel benefits essence.
[841] Then again from below called ripening action wind.
[842] Shape and color like gold wheel's thousand empty spokes,
[843] Arose possessing power moved by nature,
[844] From stirred all earth and water mandalas,
[845] Like example of butter arisen from churned milk or curd,
[846] Dust impurity went to gold, went to depth by heavy, formed ground base,
[847] Center Meru elevated upward hundred-thousand sixty ten-thousand leagues, floated clear above,
[848] Also inserted that much downward to gold ground,
[849] Combined three hundred-thousand twenty-thousand leagues.
[850] From some tantra,
[851] Also explained inserted downward ten-thousand four thousand leagues.
[852] That Meru's east formed from silver,
[853] South baiḍūrya,
[854] West padma rāga,
[855] North formed from gold, direction sky's radiance harmonious with these.
[856] That Meru from gold ground elevated, half eighty-thousand leagues below water submerged,
[857] Below half above, four stacked tiers remain, lower wind tier called turquoise vajra-possessing, turquoise vajra inserted,
[858] That also width eighty-thousand leagues, equal distance with water,
[859] Elevated outward sixteen thousand from Meru,
[860] Height three-times all equal,
[861] Summit one upward ten ten-thousand leagues exist.
[862] Second tier is:
[863] Above that, formed from water, called tier lotus variously-stacked,
[864] Crystal nature blazing light,
[865] Elevated outward eight thousand leagues from Meru.
[866] Above that in third tier, formed from gold, called wheel variously-stacked,
[867] Elevated outward four thousand leagues from Meru.
[868] Above that in fourth tier, called jewel light-blazing,
[869] Formed from coral, radiating red like fire light,
[870] Make showing limit of rain fall and not-fall by beings' action.
[871] Elevated outward two-thousand leagues from Meru.
[872] These seven sporting lakes outer, seven gold mountains, circling four corners all directions, seven mountains.
[873] Inside from sequence:
[874] Yoke-holder,
[875] Plow-arrow-holder,
[876] Acacia-possessing,
[877] Beautiful-to-see,
[878] Horse-ear,
[879] Prostrate,
[880] Rim-holder—these from water-interval upward surpassing's portion:
[881] Yojana forty-thousand,
[882] Twenty-thousand,
[883] Five-thousand,
[884] Two-thousand five-hundred,
[885] Thousand and half and three-hundred,
[886] Six-hundred twenty-five.
[887] Width:
[888] Individual portion from how-much surpassing, that-much each exists.
[889] These interval in eight lakes surrounding exist,
[890] Great nāgas eight eon-playing outer-playing's lake called.
[891] Play-lake first's width: yojana thousand eighty,
