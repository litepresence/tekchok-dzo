[11335] <prose> Arising from Self-Arisen Rigpa:</prose>
[11336] <prose> All these are called the natural state of primordially pure essence,</prose>
[11337] <prose> Neither cut off from India nor fallen into any direction.</prose>
[11338] <prose> Beneath this exists what is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence,</prose>
[11339] <prose> In which there are eight modes of manifestation.</prose>
[11340] <prose> There are two gates.</prose>
[11341] <prose> This is called the Ground of Spontaneous Presence.</prose>
[11342] <prose> It is called the Ground of Indeterminacy.</prose>
[11343] <prose> It is also called the Ground Manifesting as Diversity.</prose>
[11344] <prose> Below this lies the turning point. || 10 ||</prose>
[11345] <prose> Beneath this exists what is called the Great Ground-Appearance.</prose>
[11346] <prose> Beneath this exists the Sambhogakaya appearance, it is taught.</prose>
[11347] <prose> Therefore, when these meanings are explained in detail here,</prose>
[11348] <prose> The essence, abiding as form within the youthful vase body of the primordial expanse,</prose>
[11349] <prose> The nature, abiding as speech,</prose>
[11350] <prose> The compassion, abiding as mind.</prose>
[11351] <prose> Moreover, from the outward projection of the tones of rigpa abiding as quintessence in the five wisdom winds with the four limbs of the life-wind,</prose>
[11352] <prose> From the resonance of spontaneous presence in the expanding expanse of the youthful vase body, the appearances of five lights arise as fiery sparks.</prose>
[11353] <prose> At the same time, the investigating consciousness arises toward the tones of compassion-rigpa,</prose>
[11354] <prose> From the mere aspect of not knowing its own face, it abides as non-recognition dependent upon rigpa. || 20 ||</prose>
[11355] <prose> Although the ground itself does not change, because of the arising of ground-appearance, it seems as though it changes.</prose>
[11356] <prose> This is called the change of appearance in rigpa.</prose>
[11357] <prose> At that time, from the state of primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,</prose>
[11358] <prose> The eight modes of spontaneous presence arise as self-appearance.</prose>
[11359] <prose> The great manner of appearance of the precious casket jewel is:</prose>
[11360] <prose> The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed gives rise to compassion for sentient beings.</prose>
[11361] <prose> The gate of light appearing unobstructed fills appearances with the self-light of the five wisdoms, like a rainbow.</prose>
[11362] <prose> The gate of wisdom appearing unobstructed abides in the state of non-conceptuality.</prose>
[11363] <prose> The gate of form appearing unobstructed fills space with the clear light bodies of peaceful and wrathful deities.</prose>
[11364] <prose> The gate of non-duality appearing unobstructed does not conceive of singular or plural. || 30 ||</prose>
[11365] <prose> The gate of beyond-extremes appearing unobstructed makes spontaneous presence naturally clear in its own state.</prose>
[11366] <prose> The gate of pure wisdom appearing unobstructed reveals appearances above like a cloudless sky, the primordially pure appearance.</prose>
[11367] <prose> The gate of impure samsara appearing unobstructed reveals the appearances of the six realms below.</prose>
[11368] <prose> Thus samsara and the lower realms manifest in spontaneous presence.</prose>
[11369] <prose> This is the manner of it.</prose>
[11370] <prose> In this way, from the power of spontaneous presence appearance, within the five wisdom fields, Sambhogakaya appearances are directly self-clear.</prose>
[11371] <prose> From the power of qualities in the directions, Natural Nirmanakaya fields appear self-arisen, immeasurable.</prose>
[11372] <prose> From the power of compassion below, sentient beings appear immeasurably, self-appearing.</prose>
[11373] <prose> Such ground-appearance clarity, though manifestly appearing, is like reflections in a mirror.</prose>
[11374] <prose> Appearing to oneself, not appearing to others, not recognized as self-appearance, like dream appearances, || 40 ||</prose>
[11375] <prose> Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant,</prose>
[11376] <prose> Not grasping its own face, but for a single moment.</prose>
[11377] <prose> This too is the spontaneous presence appearance within primordial purity.</prose>
[11378] <prose> Beneath this exists the great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays.</prose>
[11379] <prose> Beneath this exists the Sambhogakaya appearance.</prose>
[11380] <prose> Beneath this exists the Natural Nirmanakaya appearance.</prose>
[11381] <prose> Beneath this exists the appearance of the six realms.</prose>
[11382] <prose> The six Subduers, Nirmanakayas subduing beings,</prose>
[11383] <prose> And the impure Nirmanakaya fields that tame through birth, aging, sickness, and death.</prose>
[11384] <prose> These eight modes of spontaneous presence are the source from which all these arise. || 50 ||</prose>
[11385] <prose> Like a container for roasting barley.</prose>
[11386] <prose> Therefore this is called the casket.</prose>
[11387] <prose> These also, from the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra:</prose>
[11388] <tantra> "Alas, though there is no error, from my power error arises,</tantra>
[11389] <tantra> From the unchanging ground,</tantra>
[11390] <tantra> Appearing without ceasing in its nature,</tantra>
[11391] <tantra> From compassion's indeterminacy, non-recognition self-arises.</tantra>
[11392] <tantra> For example, just as clouds do not truly exist in the sky but arise adventitiously,</tantra>
[11393] <tantra> So ground, path, and rigpa do not exist as such,</tantra>
[11394] <tantra> Yet from appearing like compassion, non-recognition arises. || 60 ||</tantra>
[11395] <tantra> The nature of spontaneous presence is established."</tantra>
[11396] <prose> This too abides as great indeterminate appearance.</prose>
[11397] <prose> This possesses eight modes of appearance.</prose>
[11398] <prose> It is called the Precious Jewel Casket nature.</prose>
[11399] <prose> The gate of sense pleasures unobstructed.</prose>
[11400] <prose> Abiding as the great unestablished establishment.</prose>
[11401] <prose> The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed.</prose>
[11402] <prose> The enjoyment of wisdom appearing unobstructed.</prose>
[11403] <prose> The essence appearing unobstructed as form.</prose>
[11404] <prose> The view indeterminate, appearing as non-dual. || 70 ||</prose>
[11405] <prose> The method unobstructed, appearing as beyond-extremes.</prose>
[11406] <prose> The pure wisdom gate fully passed through.</prose>
[11407] <prose> The compassion unobstructed, appearing as impure.</prose>
[11408] <prose> Like a wish-fulfilling jewel,</prose>
[11409] <prose> Such abides in my body.</prose>
[11410] <prose> The inner youthful vase body, wide and expansive,</prose>
[11411] <prose> The outer abides as the nature of spontaneous presence.</prose>
[11412] <prose> At that time, my appearance expands outward,</prose>
[11413] <prose> Undefined and indefinite,</prose>
[11414] <prose> Fragmented and scattered, || 80 ||</prose>
[11415] <prose> Unmeasured and untamed,</prose>
[11416] <prose> Unwavering and undistracted,</prose>
[11417] <prose> Moving,</prose>
[11418] <prose> Shifting,</prose>
[11419] <prose> Arising diversely.</prose>
[11420] <prose> Thereafter the great nature of spontaneous presence is established.</prose>
[11421] <prose> From the unobstructed gate of wisdom, the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance is established.</prose>
[11422] <prose> From the unobstructed gate of qualities, the manner of Natural Nirmanakaya appearance exists.</prose>
[11423] <prose> From that unobstructed compassion, the impure manner of appearance arises.</prose>
[11424] <prose> Such appearance is the great dharma beyond measure and conception. || 90 ||</prose>
[11425] <prose> All lights and forms are magnificently arrayed in spontaneous presence.</prose>
[11426] <prose> The broad gate of samsara and nirvana arising.</prose>
[11427] <prose> The great casket that encompasses all.</prose>
[11428] <prose> From the Garland of Pearls:</prose>
[11429] <verse> "Radiance manifestly appears, majestically great,</verse>
[11430] <verse> Appearance itself is spontaneously beautiful, || 100 ||</verse>
[11431] <verse> The Dharmakaya is introduced and delighted,</verse>
[11432] <verse> The essence is pristine, the casket vast,</verse>
[11433] <verse> The nature all-pervasive, magnificently expansive,</verse>
[11434] <verse> The compassion all-arising, magnificently productive,</verse>
[11435] <verse> The pervasion is the original tone, splendidly clear,</verse>
[11436] <verse> The abiding is unobstructed, swiftly flowing,</verse>
[11437] <verse> The self-snow of rigpa, luminously clear,</verse>
[11438] <verse> The emptiness all-arising, face wondrous,</verse>
[11439] <verse> Unsought, self-settled, continuously enduring, || 110 ||</verse>
[11440] <verse> Unobstructed, self-arising, magnificently established,</verse>
[11441] <verse> The appearances of samsara and existence, foundation towering,</verse>
[11442] <verse> Effortless self-liberation, greatly expansive,</verse>
[11443] <verse> Great primordial realization, skillfully circling,</verse>
[11444] <verse> Possessing five colors, beautifully inscribed,</verse>
[11445] <verse> Samsara and existence utterly pure, perfectly even, || 120 ||</verse>
[11446] <verse> Self-arisen clear light, beautifully arrayed,</verse>
[11447] <verse> The great ground-appearance, greatly encompassing,</verse>
[11448] <verse> The two, samsara and nirvana, skillfully related,</verse>
[11449] <verse> The five bodies and five wisdoms, beautifully stacked."</verse>
[11450] <verse> Thus it is.</verse>
[11451] <prose> From such appearance,</prose>
[11452] <prose> When the eight modes of spontaneous presence are explained in detail,</prose>
[11453] <prose> From the Precious Heap Tantra:</prose>
[11454] <tantra> "Alas, Teacher Samantabhadra, || 130 ||</tantra>
[11455] <tantra> What is the manner of the ground appearing?</tantra>
[11456] <tantra> How many gates of qualities appear?</tantra>
[11457] <tantra> From emptiness, how do</tantra>
[11458] <tantra> Qualities appear complete? Please teach me."</tantra>
[11459] <tantra> Then he spoke thus:</tantra>
[11460] <tantra> "From the miracle of non-arising,</tantra>
[11461] <tantra> In the activity of the Buddhas,</tantra>
[11462] <tantra> From the beginning, without discerning,</tantra>
[11463] <tantra> Without ceasing, without termination, || 140 ||</tantra>
[11464] <tantra> Appearance itself is primordially pure,</tantra>
[11465] <tantra> Abiding in its own face.</tantra>
[11466] <tantra> From the great unceasing compassion,</tantra>
[11467] <tantra> Spontaneous presence, indeterminate,</tantra>
[11468] <tantra> Arises in the manner of eight appearances.</tantra>
[11469] <tantra> Through the unobstructed manner of appearance,</tantra>
[11470] <tantra> From the manner of appearance like compassion, || 150 ||</tantra>
[11471] <tantra> The source of protection for all sentient beings.</tantra>
[11472] <tantra> From self-clear unobstructed appearance,</tantra>
[11473] <tantra> Appears in the manner of the five lights' arising.</tantra>
[11474] <tantra> Through the unobstructed appearance of knowledge,</tantra>
[11475] <tantra> Into the gate of pure wisdom,</tantra>
[11476] <tantra> Appearance arises unobstructed, like the path.</tantra>
[11477] <tantra> Since all bodies are complete in self-appearance, || 160 ||</tantra>
[11478] <tantra> They appear as the body of all dharmas.</tantra>
[11479] <tantra> Since the essence is one,</tantra>
[11480] <tantra> It also appears as non-dual.</tantra>
[11481] <tantra> Since it does not abide in its own place,</tantra>
[11482] <tantra> In the great appearance beyond-extremes,</tantra>
[11483] <tantra> The indeterminate spontaneous presence appears in the ground.</tantra>
[11484] <tantra> Since rigpa is spontaneously complete in one, || 170 ||</tantra>
[11485] <tantra> Into the gate of pure great wisdom,</tantra>
[11486] <tantra> Related to the essence itself.</tantra>
[11487] <tantra> Since the manner of arising is unobstructed,</tantra>
[11488] <tantra> As the source of arising for all sentient beings,</tantra>
[11489] <tantra> Like the gate of impure appearance,</tantra>
[11490] <tantra> Arising from the aspect of pervading appearance,</tantra>
[11491] <tantra> All this appears as the eight appearances. || 180 ||</tantra>
[11492] <tantra> Since it self-arises in the manner of arising,</tantra>
[11493] <tantra> It is called the appearance of spontaneous presence.</tantra>
[11494] <tantra> Appearing in the manner of the precious jewel.</tantra>
[11495] <tantra> Thus from the great empty-clear,</tantra>
[11496] <tantra> The manner of appearing as anything from nothing,</tantra>
[11497] <tantra> The manner of qualities unobstructed,</tantra>
[11498] <tantra> The unobstructed appearance of spontaneous presence, || 190 ||</tantra>
[11499] <tantra> As the nature of various appearances,</tantra>
[11500] <tantra> Appears as great qualities.</tantra>
[11501] <tantra> From the eight gates of appearance,</tantra>
[11502] <tantra> Appear in the manner of eight qualities."</tantra>
[11503] <tantra> Thus it is.</tantra>
