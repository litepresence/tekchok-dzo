[11335] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[11336] <prose><tantra> "These are the nature of primordial purity," it is said,
[11337] <prose><tantra> Not falling into any direction of India or Tibet.
[11338] <prose><tantra> Thereafter exists the Precious Jewel Casket of Spontaneous Presence,
[11339] <prose><tantra> In which there are eight modes of appearance.
[11340] <prose><tantra> There are two gates.
[11341] <prose><tantra> This is called the Ground of Spontaneous Presence.
[11342] <prose><tantra> It is called the Ground of Indeterminacy.
[11343] <prose><tantra> It is also called the Ground Appearing as Diversity.
[11344] <prose><tantra> Below this lies the point of reversal.
[11345] <prose><tantra> Thereafter exists the Great Ground-Appearance.
[11346] <prose><tantra> Thereafter exists the Sambhogakaya appearance, it is taught.
[11347] Therefore, when explaining these meanings here in detail,
[11348] The essence abiding as form within the youthful vase body of the primordial expanse,
[11349] The nature abiding as speech,
[11350] The compassion abiding as mind.
[11351] Moreover, from the outward projection of the tones of rigpa abiding as the quintessence in the five wisdom winds with the four limbs of the life-wind,
[11352] From the tones of spontaneous presence in the expanding expanse of the youthful vase body, the appearances of five lights arise as fiery sparks.
[11353] At the same time, the investigating consciousness arises toward the tones of rigpa-compassion,
[11354] From the mere aspect of not knowing its own face, it abides as non-recognition dependent upon rigpa.
[11355] Although the ground itself does not change, because of the appearance of ground-appearance arising, it seems as though it changes.
[11356] This is called the change of appearance in rigpa.
[11357] At that time, from the state of primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,
[11358] The eight modes of spontaneous presence arise as self-appearance.
[11359] The great manner of appearance of the precious casket jewel is:
[11360] The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed gives rise to compassion for sentient beings.
[11361] The gate of light appearing unobstructed fills appearances with the self-light of the five wisdoms, like a rainbow.
[11362] The gate of wisdom appearing unobstructed abides in the state of non-conceptuality.
[11363] The gate of form appearing unobstructed fills space with the clear light bodies of peaceful and wrathful deities.
[11364] The gate of non-duality appearing unobstructed does not conceive of singular or plural.
[11365] The gate of beyond-extremes appearing unobstructed makes spontaneous presence naturally clear in its own state.
[11366] The gate of pure wisdom appearing unobstructed reveals appearances above like a cloudless sky, the primordially pure appearance.
[11367] The gate of impure samsara appearing unobstructed reveals the appearances of the six realms below.
[11368] Thus samsara and the lower realms manifest in spontaneous presence.
[11369] This is the manner of it.
[11370] In this way, from the power of spontaneous presence appearance, within the five wisdom fields, Sambhogakaya appearances are directly self-clear.
[11371] From the power of qualities in the directions, Natural Nirmanakaya fields appear self-arisen, immeasurable.
[11372] From the power of compassion below, sentient beings appear immeasurably, self-appearing.
[11373] Such ground-appearance clarity, though manifestly appearing, is like reflections in a mirror.
[11374] Appearing to oneself, not appearing to others, not recognized as self-appearance, like dream appearances,
[11375] Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant,
[11376] Not grasping its own face, but for a single moment.
[11377] This too is the spontaneous presence appearance within primordial purity.
[11378] Thereafter exists the great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays.
[11379] Thereafter exists the Sambhogakaya appearance.
[11380] Thereafter exists the Natural Nirmanakaya appearance.
[11381] Thereafter exists the appearance of the six realms.
[11382] The six Subduers, Nirmanakayas subduing beings,
[11383] And the impure Nirmanakaya fields that tame through birth, aging, sickness, and death.
[11384] These eight modes of spontaneous presence are the source from which all these arise.
[11385] Like a container for roasting barley.
[11386] Therefore this is called the casket.
[11387] These also, from the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra:
[11388] <prose><tantra> "Alas, though there is no error, from my power error arises,
[11389] <prose><tantra> From the unchanging ground,
[11390] <prose><tantra> Appearing without ceasing in its nature,
[11391] <prose><tantra> From compassion's indeterminacy, non-recognition self-arises.
[11392] <prose><tantra> For example, just as clouds do not truly exist in the sky but arise adventitiously,
[11393] <prose><tantra> So ground, path, and rigpa do not exist as such,
[11394] <prose><tantra> Yet from appearing like compassion, non-recognition arises.
[11395] <prose><tantra> The nature of spontaneous presence is established."
[11396] This too abides as great indeterminate appearance.
[11397] This possesses eight modes of appearance.
[11398] It is called the Precious Jewel Casket nature.
[11399] The gate of sense pleasures unobstructed.
[11400] Abiding as the great unestablished establishment.
[11401] The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed.
[11402] The enjoyment of wisdom appearing unobstructed.
[11403] The essence appearing unobstructed as form.
[11404] The view indeterminate, appearing as non-dual.
[11405] The method unobstructed, appearing as beyond-extremes.
[11406] The pure wisdom gate fully passed through.
[11407] The compassion unobstructed, appearing as impure.
[11408] Like a wish-fulfilling jewel,
[11409] Such abides in my body.
[11410] The inner youthful vase body, wide and expansive,
[11411] The outer abides as the nature of spontaneous presence.
[11412] At that time, my appearance expands outward,
[11413] Undefined and indefinite,
[11414] Fragmented and scattered,
[11415] Unmeasured and untamed,
[11416] Unwavering and undistracted,
[11417] Moving,
[11418] Shifting,
[11419] Arising diversely.
[11420] Thereafter the great nature of spontaneous presence is established.
[11421] From the unobstructed gate of wisdom, the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance is established.
[11422] From the unobstructed gate of qualities, the manner of Natural Nirmanakaya appearance exists.
[11423] From that unobstructed compassion, the impure manner of appearance arises.
[11424] Such appearance is the great dharma beyond measure and conception.
[11425] All lights and forms are magnificently arrayed in spontaneous presence.
[11426] The broad gate of samsara and nirvana arising.
[11427] The great casket that encompasses all.
[11428] From the Garland of Pearls:
[11429] <prose><tantra> "Radiance manifestly appears, majestically great,
[11430] <prose><tantra> Appearance itself is spontaneously beautiful,
[11431] <prose><tantra> The Dharmakaya is introduced and delighted,
[11432] <prose><tantra> The essence is pristine, the casket vast,
[11433] <prose><tantra> The nature all-pervasive, magnificently expansive,
[11434] <prose><tantra> The compassion all-arising, magnificently productive,
[11435] <prose><tantra> The pervasion is the original tone, splendidly clear,
[11436] <prose><tantra> The abiding is unobstructed, swiftly flowing,
[11437] <prose><tantra> The self-snow of rigpa, luminously clear,
[11438] <prose><tantra> The emptiness all-arising, face wondrous,
[11439] <prose><tantra> Unsought, self-settled, continuously enduring,
[11440] <prose><tantra> Unobstructed, self-arising, magnificently established,
[11441] <prose><tantra> The appearances of samsara and existence, foundation towering,
[11442] <prose><tantra> Effortless self-liberation, greatly expansive,
[11443] <prose><tantra> Great primordial realization, skillfully circling,
[11444] <prose><tantra> Possessing five colors, beautifully inscribed,
[11445] <prose><tantra> Samsara and existence utterly pure, perfectly even,
[11446] <prose><tantra> Self-arisen clear light, beautifully arrayed,
[11447] <prose><tantra> The great ground-appearance, greatly encompassing,
[11448] <prose><tantra> The two, samsara and nirvana, skillfully related,
[11449] <prose><tantra> The five bodies and five wisdoms, beautifully stacked."
[11450] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[11451] From such appearance,
[11452] When the eight modes of spontaneous presence are explained in detail,
[11453] From the Precious Heap Tantra:
[11454] <prose><tantra> "Alas, Teacher Samantabhadra,
[11455] <prose><tantra> What is the manner of the ground appearing?
[11456] <prose><tantra> How many gates of qualities appear?
[11457] <prose><tantra> From emptiness, how do
[11458] <prose><tantra> Qualities appear complete? Please teach me."
[11459] <prose><tantra> Then he spoke thus:
[11460] <prose><tantra> "From the miracle of non-arising,
[11461] <prose><tantra> In the activity of the Buddhas,
[11462] <prose><tantra> From the beginning, without discerning,
[11463] <prose><tantra> Without ceasing, without termination,
[11464] <prose><tantra> Appearance itself is primordially pure,
[11465] <prose><tantra> Abiding in its own face.
[11466] <prose><tantra> From the great unceasing compassion,
[11467] <prose><tantra> Spontaneous presence, indeterminate,
[11468] <prose><tantra> Arises in the manner of eight appearances.
[11469] <prose><tantra> Through the unobstructed manner of appearance,
[11470] <prose><tantra> From the manner of appearance like compassion,
[11471] <prose><tantra> The source of protection for all sentient beings.
[11472] <prose><tantra> From self-clear unobstructed appearance,
[11473] <prose><tantra> Appears in the manner of the five lights' arising.
[11474] <prose><tantra> Through the unobstructed appearance of knowledge,
[11475] <prose><tantra> Into the gate of pure wisdom,
[11476] <prose><tantra> Appearance arises unobstructed, like the path.
[11477] <prose><tantra> Since all bodies are complete in self-appearance,
[11478] <prose><tantra> They appear as the body of all dharmas.
[11479] <prose><tantra> Since the essence is one,
[11480] <prose><tantra> It also appears as non-dual.
[11481] <prose><tantra> Since it does not abide in its own place,
[11482] <prose><tantra> In the great appearance beyond-extremes,
[11483] <prose><tantra> The indeterminate spontaneous presence appears in the ground.
[11484] <prose><tantra> Since rigpa is spontaneously complete in one,
[11485] <prose><tantra> Into the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11486] <prose><tantra> Related to the essence itself.
[11487] <prose><tantra> Since the manner of arising is unobstructed,
[11488] <prose><tantra> As the source of arising for all sentient beings,
[11489] <prose><tantra> Like the gate of impure appearance,
[11490] <prose><tantra> Arising from the aspect of pervading appearance,
[11491] <prose><tantra> All this appears as the eight appearances.
[11492] <prose><tantra> Since it self-arises in the manner of arising,
[11493] <prose><tantra> It is called the appearance of spontaneous presence.
[11494] <prose><tantra> Appearing in the manner of the precious jewel.
[11495] <prose><tantra> Thus from the great empty-clear,
[11496] <prose><tantra> The manner of appearing as anything from nothing,
[11497] <prose><tantra> The manner of qualities unobstructed,
[11498] <prose><tantra> The unobstructed appearance of spontaneous presence,
[11499] <prose><tantra> As the nature of various appearances,
[11500] <prose><tantra> Appears as great qualities.
[11501] <prose><tantra> From the eight gates of appearance,
[11502] <prose><tantra> Appear in the manner of eight qualities."
[11503] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[11504] In the place of the appearance of the eight outward-projecting modes of spontaneous presence, it is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of Ground-Appearance.
[11505] The complete primordial ground,
[11506] The ground and the ground of spontaneous presence of natural sleep, the Precious Casket,
[11507] The complete fruition, the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of Secret Casket,
[11508] These are explained as the three caskets of spontaneous presence.
[11509] The ground appearing is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of the Path.
[11510] When taking into experience, all the wisdoms of the four appearances and all path appearances arise from this.
[11511] From the eight gates of spontaneous presence appearance, all dharmas of samsara and nirvana arise with unobstructed gates,
[11512] Particularly, from the self-light of form and wisdom, the ground Sambhogakaya appearance of clear light pure elements appears as original presence.
[11513] The warm aspect of the wisdom fire,
[11514] The cool water of compassion gathering,
[11515] The light earth abiding in the expanse,
[11516] The moving aspect of the fivefold self-power wind abiding, the appearance of the mandala.
[11517] From the tones or power of that appearance, Natural Nirmanakaya fields are adorned with immeasurable richness.
[11518] From those tones, Nirmanakayas subduing beings work for the benefit of the appearance of wandering beings.
[11519] The impure Nirmanakaya appearance increases and is established.
[11520] Though these were shown above,
[11521] Because they were explained extensively,
[11522] For the sake of easy understanding, they are further explained.
[11523] From the Auspicious Beautiful:
[11524] <prose><tantra> "From that arises the manner of appearance of the Precious Spontaneous Presence.
[11525] <prose><tantra> This is called the ground from which all dharmas arise for the Buddha.
[11526] <prose><tantra> From that the Buddha arises.
[11527] <prose><tantra> Sentient beings arise.
[11528] <prose><tantra> Wisdom arises.
[11529] <prose><tantra> Light arises.
[11530] <prose><tantra> Rigpa arises.
[11531] <prose><tantra> Non-recognition arises.
[11532] <prose><tantra> All karma arises.
[11533] <prose><tantra> Compassion arises.
[11534] <prose><tantra> Appearances as existence arise.
[11535] <prose><tantra> This is the essence.
[11536] <prose><tantra> The nature appears as such.
[11537] <prose><tantra> Compassion appears as such.
[11538] <prose><tantra> Power exists.
[11539] <prose><tantra> Appearance exists.
[11540] <prose><tantra> Mind exists.
[11541] <prose><tantra> Mentality exists.
[11542] <prose><tantra> Error exists.
[11543] <prose><tantra> Non-error also exists.
[11544] <prose><tantra> The great arising of all.
[11545] <prose><tantra> This is called the great expanse of Buddhas and sentient beings.
[11546] <prose><tantra> From that arises the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance.
[11547] <prose><tantra> This is called the ground of manifest path appearance.
[11548] <prose><tantra> This is luminous,
[11549] <prose><tantra> Warm,
[11550] <prose><tantra> Cool,
[11551] <prose><tantra> Light,
[11552] <prose><tantra> Possessing the nature of the moving,
[11553] <prose><tantra> Possessing the five bodies,
[11554] <prose><tantra> Possessing the five wisdoms,
[11555] <prose><tantra> The five families,
[11556] <prose><tantra> The five colors,
[11557] <prose><tantra> The five lights,
[11558] <prose><tantra> The five fathers,
[11559] <prose><tantra> The five mothers,
[11560] <prose><tantra> The five forms,
[11561] <prose><tantra> The five sounds,
[11562] <prose><tantra> The five smells,
[11563] <prose><tantra> The five tastes,
[11564] <prose><tantra> The five touches,
[11565] <prose><tantra> The five dharmas,
[11566] <prose><tantra> The five appearances,
[11567] <prose><tantra> The five principal ones,
[11568] <prose><tantra> Possessing the five retinues."
[11569] <prose><tantra> These possess the thirty-two major marks.
[11570] <prose><tantra> Possessing the eighty minor marks.
[11571] <prose><tantra> Possessing the six broad dharmas.
[11572] <prose><tantra> This is the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance,
[11573] <prose><tantra> The connection arising from that and that.
[11574] <prose><tantra> From that appearance, the appearance of Natural Nirmanakaya,
[11575] <prose><tantra> The manner of Nirmanakaya appearance subduing beings,
[11576] <prose><tantra> The manner of impure Nirmanakaya appearance is established.
[11577] <prose><tantra> The Natural Nirmanakaya body itself
[11578] <prose><tantra> Arises from spontaneous presence.
[11579] <prose><tantra> The manner of appearance of that Natural Nirmanakaya body is:
[11580] <prose><tantra> Enjoyment inexhaustible,
[11581] <prose><tantra> Retinue inexhaustible,
[11582] <prose><tantra> Qualities unknowable,
[11583] <prose><tantra> Power unknowable,
[11584] <prose><tantra> Power unknowable,
[11585] <prose><tantra> Miracles unknowable,
[11586] <prose><tantra> Lifespan immeasurable,
[11587] <prose><tantra> Free from all suffering of illness,
[11588] <prose><tantra> The palace inconceivable,
[11589] <prose><tantra> Teaching dharmas inconceivable."
[11590] <prose><tantra> This is called the manner of Natural Nirmanakaya appearance.
[11591] <prose><tantra> From that arises the Nirmanakaya subduing beings.
[11592] <prose><tantra> That appears as diversity, knowing the meaning of diversity,
[11593] <prose><tantra> Though appearing, not interrupted,
[11594] <prose><tantra> Not attached to appearance,
[11595] <prose><tantra> Possessing pure eyes,
[11596] <prose><tantra> Possessing pure ears,
[11597] <prose><tantra> Possessing pure nose,
[11598] <prose><tantra> Possessing pure tongue,
[11599] <prose><tantra> Possessing pure body,
[11600] <prose><tantra> Possessing pure mind,
[11601] <prose><tantra> Showing various compassionate activities,
[11602] <prose><tantra> Possessing special wisdom,
[11603] <prose><tantra> Appearing everywhere with unobstructed knowledge."
[11604] <prose><tantra> This is the Nirmanakaya subduing beings.
[11605] <prose><tantra> From that arises the impure world-system.
[11606] <prose><tantra> This appears in the following manner as the great appearance:
[11607] <prose><tantra> From the arising of the outer container of the five elements' mandala,
[11608] <prose><tantra> Earth,
[11609] <prose><tantra> Water,
[11610] <prose><tantra> Fire,
[11611] <prose><tantra> Wind,
[11612] <prose><tantra> The great element space exists."
[11613] <prose><tantra> From that, the mind of the holder cannot be expressed in words,
[11614] <prose><tantra> Desire,
[11615] <prose><tantra> Anger,
[11616] <prose><tantra> Delusion,
[11617] <prose><tantra> Pride,
[11618] <prose><tantra> Jealousy,
[11619] <prose><tantra> And hatred—the six."
[11620] <prose><tantra> From that arise the six classes of beings."
[11621] <prose><tantra> From jealousy, humans are established."
[11622] <prose><tantra> From hatred, gods are established."
[11623] <prose><tantra> From pride, demigods are established."
[11624] <prose><tantra> From desire, hungry ghosts are established."
[11625] <prose><tantra> From delusion, animals are established."
[11626] <prose><tantra> From black anger, hell beings are established."
[11627] <prose><tantra> Thus the appearances of the six classes are established."
[11628] <prose><tantra> This is the place of samsara."
[11629] <prose><tantra> This too arises from the one great nature in four manners of appearance."
[11630] <prose><tantra> From the four natures, four manners of appearance arise."
[11631] <prose><tantra> The four great appearances are:
[11632] <prose><tantra> Spontaneous presence appearing as diversity."
[11633] <prose><tantra> Sambhogakaya abiding as the illusory nature of light with eyes and ears."
[11634] <prose><tantra> Nirmanakaya appearing as form."
[11635] <prose><tantra> Sentient beings appearing as different though appearing."
[11636] <prose><tantra> This too is called the obscuration of the manner of appearance for sentient beings."
[11637] <prose><tantra> When all this is condensed,
[11638] <prose><tantra> Below the primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,
[11639] <prose><tantra> From the eight modes of spontaneous presence gate, the wisdom appearance Sambhogakaya,
[11640] <prose><tantra> From that power directly, immeasurable appearances of the five families,
[11641] <prose><tantra> The Natural Nirmanakaya appears,
[11642] <prose><tantra> Below showing the realms of the six migrations with their tamer.
[11643] <prose><tantra> The three body appearances arising as three tiers is the appearance of the Ground of Spontaneous Presence."
[11644] <prose><tantra> The Sambhogakaya appearing to oneself, the Buddhas of the Natural Nirmanakayas subduing beings, are the power of one's own ground-appearance."
[11645] <prose><tantra> They do not exist now in any particular direction,
[11646] <prose><tantra> Because they are appearances of self-rigpa, they abide together with self-rigpa."
[11647] <prose><tantra> The appearance of the six migrations of self-appearance also does not exist elsewhere, but self-arises from the unobstructed manner of appearance like the gate of impure samsara."
[11648] <prose><tantra> Thus, though this appearance exists for each individually,
[11649] <prose><tantra> The common aspect of the common world is through common karma,
[11650] <prose><tantra> Arranged by the Teacher's activity."
[11651] <prose><tantra> The aspect appearing as error to oneself, though appearing, is arranged by the gate of self-appearance samsara."
[11652] <prose><tantra> The aspect of self-appearance goes to self-reversal when the casket shifts."
[11653] <prose><tantra> The common remains elsewhere, still wandering."
[11654] <prose><tantra> Distinguishing these two is extremely important."
[11655] <prose><tantra> Naturally, from the gate of self-arisen spontaneous presence in rigpa, the appearance of the six migrations exists."
[11656] <prose><tantra> The key point is that the deluded appearance, dream-like, must be sent to self-reversal in the ground of primordial purity without appearance."
[11657] <prose><tantra> In the bardo too, the six migrations of one's own face, whether the Nirmanakayas of self-appearance work for benefit or not, are explained as two aspects."
[11658] <prose><tantra> Before the gate of impure samsara arises, if one knows one's own self-appearance, there is no benefit to be done,
[11659] <prose><tantra> Because the object of activity does not appear."
[11660] <prose><tantra> Once arisen, benefit must be done,
[11661] <prose><tantra> Because liberation is impossible without exhausting deluded appearance."
[11662] <prose><tantra> This key point is subtle yet of great importance."
[11663] <prose><tantra> This key point is subtle yet of great importance."
[11664] Second, the detailed explanation of the faults and virtues of philosophical analysis has three parts:
[11665] The general presentation of the eight aspects of virtue,
[11666] The division into faults and virtues through conditions,
[11667] Establishing the philosophical analysis of the manner of arising and ceasing appearance.
[11668] The first:
[11669] If spontaneous presence were not spontaneously established in the primordial ground,
[11670] The meaning of ground-appearance arising would not exist, and
[11671] Without the manner of ground-appearance spontaneous presence arising,
[11672] The meaning of samsara and nirvana arising would not exist;
[11673] Therefore the inner expanse appears as subtle, the outer expanse as coarse,
[11674] Demonstrating the gate of ground-appearance.
[11675] Moreover, the mind itself is the expanse of clear light;
[11676] If from the spontaneous self-tone compassion did not arise as the producer,
[11677] Samsara and nirvana as two sides could not exist as tamer and tamed for each other.
[11678] The self-appearance of sentient beings is deluded,
[11679] The self-face of Buddhas is utterly pure;
[11680] Because appearances are not the same.
[11681] Though appearances are not the same, the benefit of sentient beings arises because compassion exists in the ground, arising from ground-appearance,
[11682] The connection of tamer and tamed exists;
[11683] From the Secret Essence:
[11684] <prose><tantra> "Through the connection of great compassion,
[11685] <prose><tantra> The six migrations appear without exception in time."
[11686] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[11687] Likewise, if the ground of light-ray rigpa and appearance did not exist, the meaning of the five elements appearing separately would not exist,
[11688] Without that, rigpa would be internally blocked,
[11689] With no elements at all, the appearance of container and contained would not arise;
[11690] Because light-like appearance exists, that is its virtue.
[11691] If there were no non-dual appearance, the three gates could not connect as one;
[11692] The three, body, speech, and mind of sentient beings,
[11693] The three bodies of Buddhas without separation is the virtue.
[11694] If form-like appearance did not exist, bodies would have no meaning to appear; that appearance of wandering beings' bodies and victorious ones' bodies exists is the virtue.
[11695] If wisdom-like appearance did not exist, there would be the fault of no wisdom appearance of the path connecting beyond samsara;
[11696] Because this exists, the appearance of the four wisdoms of path exists, that is the virtue.
[11697] Because beyond-extremes-like appearance exists, Buddhas arise not returning from externals;
[11698] Without that they would not arise, therefore that too is the virtue.
[11699] If impure-gate-like appearance did not exist in spontaneously present original presence,
[11700] Sentient beings appearing in samsara would have no meaning to come to this rigpa-face;
[11701] Because that exists, appearing as the six migrations' individual appearances is also that virtue;
[11702] From the Powerful One:
[11703] <prose><tantra> "In spontaneous presence manifestly appearing as samsara and the lower realms."
[11704] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[11705] If the gate of pure wisdom did not exist, the appearance of nirvana would have no meaning to come;
[11706] Because that exists, the appearance of Buddhas in the rigpa-face exists, that is the virtue of existence.
[11707] Moreover, spontaneous presence has gates of seeing whether pure or impure appear, like windows exist;
[11708] But pure and impure do not exist in the ground itself.
[11709] Thus, counting the eight aspects of virtue in the eight modes of spontaneous presence appearance is the philosophical analysis;
[11710] From the Precious Heap:
[11711] <prose><tantra> "From the eight gates of appearance,
[11712] <prose><tantra> Appear in the manner of eight virtues.
[11713] <prose><tantra> Cutting the escape hole of the six migrations,
[11714] <prose><tantra> Those who cut the binding rope of samsara,
[11715] <prose><tantra> Through the hook of compassion,
[11716] <prose><tantra> For sentient beings of the four modes of birth,
[11717] <prose><tantra> Appear as great compassion itself.
[11718] <prose><tantra> Samsara and nirvana self-related as virtue,
[11719] <prose><tantra> Appear in the manner of mixing the two aspects.
[11720] <prose><tantra> Without this, samsara and nirvana would be cut as separate sides,
[11721] <prose><tantra> Becoming the fault of no realization.
[11722] <prose><tantra> This is the manner of virtues arising.
[11723] <prose><tantra> In the self-realm of all Buddhas,
[11724] <prose><tantra> Like body and shadow,
[11725] <prose><tantra> Because the five lights of appearance pervade,
[11726] <prose><tantra> The inner appearance aspect self-clear,
[11727] <prose><tantra> From the gate of appearance in the manner of five lights,
[11728] <prose><tantra> The virtue clarifier does not stray outward.
[11729] <prose><tantra> Without this, sentient beings' self-light
[11730] <prose><tantra> Would become blocked and cut off separately.
[11731] <prose><tantra> Because the arising connector of union appears,
[11732] <prose><tantra> Self-appearance arose as great virtue.
[11733] <prose><tantra> Because all bodies are condensed as one,
[11734] <prose><tantra> The three bodies abide as one,
[11735] <prose><tantra> In the nature of essence-body,
[11736] <prose><tantra> Not separating within self-appearance,
[11737] <prose><tantra> The essence clarifier appears as five bodies.
[11738] <prose><tantra> Without this, essence is not found,
[11739] <prose><tantra> All bodies appear like the complete body.
[11740] <prose><tantra> All these without being different,
[11741] <prose><tantra> Abiding equally as non-dual,
[11742] <prose><tantra> Through appearance without separation, non-dual,
[11743] <prose><tantra> In the manner of great pervasion,
[11744] <prose><tantra> Appears pervading outer and inner.
[11745] <prose><tantra> Without this, with self-face different,
[11746] <prose><tantra> The juncture of samsara and nirvana mixing is not found.
[11747] <prose><tantra> Not liberated from one's own ground,
[11748] <prose><tantra> Becomes the fault of no reversal.
[11749] <prose><tantra> The appearance maker appears as virtue manner.
[11750] <prose><tantra> Because self-pervading all knowables,
[11751] <prose><tantra> In the great appearance of ground-path,
[11752] <prose><tantra> Appears as the path of samsara-nirvana connection.
[11753] <prose><tantra> Without this, ground-path not found,
[11754] <prose><tantra> In the path of the four wisdoms,
[11755] <prose><tantra> In the secret path of sentient beings,
[11756] <prose><tantra> Also in the manner of four appearances,
[11757] <prose><tantra> Simultaneously and gradually,
[11758] <prose><tantra> While sense gates exist, they appear.
[11759] <prose><tantra> Beyond the stains of four extremes,
[11760] <prose><tantra> The unobstructed virtue appearance maker,
[11761] <prose><tantra> In the great manner of beyond-extremes appearance,
[11762] <prose><tantra> From the great spontaneous self-completion,
[11763] <prose><tantra> To practice in definite primordial purity,
[11764] <prose><tantra> In the wisdom of extremes and center,
[11765] <prose><tantra> This itself self-arisen, self-appeared,
[11766] <prose><tantra> In the appearance liberated from extremes,
[11767] <prose><tantra> Appears connected with essence itself.
[11768] <prose><tantra> Without this, definite attainment not obtained,
[11769] <prose><tantra> The fault of cause-effect reversal occurs,
[11770] <prose><tantra> Therefore appearing truly as beyond-extremes.
[11771] <prose><tantra> Virtue appearance manner unobstructed,
[11772] <prose><tantra> As the source producing samsara,
[11773] <prose><tantra> Like the impure gate of appearance,
[11774] <prose><tantra> Appears without ceasing in manner of arising.
[11775] <prose><tantra> Without this, delusion without name,
[11776] <prose><tantra> Therefore the gate of impure samsara,
[11777] <prose><tantra> As the cause-rope of existences,
[11778] <prose><tantra> Appears in unobstructed manner of appearance.
[11779] <prose><tantra> Called the gate of impure samsara.
[11780] <prose><tantra> Because sudden-transcending wisdom exists,
[11781] <prose><tantra> Purity itself demonstrates purity.
[11782] Appearance maker, appearance, individual paths,
[11783] <prose><tantra> To the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11784] <prose><tantra> Appears as threefold self-liberated.
[11785] <prose><tantra> Without this, self-power not complete,
[11786] <prose><tantra> To the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11787] <prose><tantra> Appears to realize essence primordial purity."
[11788] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[11789] Second, the division into faults and virtues through conditions:
[11790] Camphor at that time appears as virtue for hot disease,
[11791] Though appearing as fault for cold disease;
[11792] Yet the nature of camphor is not established as fault or virtue.
[11793] Likewise, the ground and ground-appearance manner of appearing appears as virtue for those knowing self-face as liberation condition,
[11794] Though appearing as fault for those making partial delusion ground-hope not knowing;
[11795] The ground and its appearance are not established as fault or virtue.
[11796] Moreover, from the aspect of delusion reversal manner in the place of spontaneous presence,
[11797] Because wandering beings are primordial Buddhas,
[11798] Fault itself appears as virtue, adverse conditions appear as helpers,
[11799] Faults are primordially self-liberated in their own purity.
[11800] From the aspect of spontaneous presence power-appearance face,
[11801] Because appearing like wisdom,
[11802] According to delusion entry manner, deluded as the form of affliction-fault,
[11803] From the power of spontaneous presence simultaneously reversing desired delusion,
[11804] Appearing as self-settled without establishing self, fault becomes virtue;
[11805] Obstacles become siddhis,
[11806] Obstructing demons and afflictions are not found,
[11807] Not observing virtue, the four wisdoms practice self-liberated.
[11808] From the aspect of spontaneous presence appearance manner appearing as non-dual,
[11809] According to delusion entry manner, self and other arise as two,
[11810] According to delusion reversal manner, not divided as self and other,
[11811] Established as self-settled without fabrication,
[11812] Selfless emptiness established as virtue, faults not found when sought,
[11813] Samsara and nirvana non-dual Buddha.
[11814] Moreover, from spontaneous presence appearance manner appearing as beyond-extremes,
[11815] According to samsara entry manner, elaborations deluded as faults below,
[11816] According to delusion reversal manner,
[11817] Two extremes become center, extreme delusions self-liberated, delusion appears as wisdom, Buddha.
[11818] Moreover, from the virtue aspect of spontaneous presence arising as pure wisdom gate,
[11819] According to samsara entry manner appearing as impure delusion,
[11820] According to delusion reversal manner, liberated as originally pure power-completion, Buddha.
[11821] Moreover, from the appearance aspect of spontaneous presence arising as impure samsara gate,
[11822] Two aspects of samsara manner:
[11823] From here deluded downward thus,
[11824] In the final bardo, spontaneous presence jewel not producing definite confidence, delusion of existence bardo.
[11825] According to delusion reversal manner, liberated in non-distracted abiding purity, Buddha.
[11826] Moreover, essence primordial purity free from elaborations,
[11827] Nature spontaneous presence virtue complete manner arising,
[11828] For those not realizing ground, faults arise as spontaneous presence.
[11829] Each of these six actual grounds can be liberated through sharp faculties, six liberation manners on top of unceasing existence liberation.
[11830] If deluded from above, not knowing delusion reversal, gradually deluded like the six stages,
[11831] Called the impure gate,
[11832] From delusion becoming coarse,
[11833] Miraculous birth and egg-born from light, body established.
[11834] Gradual liberation from bardo also attains stability, wisdom power completes, liberation manner seven certain,
[11835] There realization not born, habituation short time, inferior faculties,
[11836] Ground not grasped there, existence bardo appears,
[11837] Reaching the following appearance.
[11838] Therefore delusion-ground and
[11839] Liberation-ground both touch the spontaneous presence gate, understand well.
[11840] Third, establishing the philosophical analysis of arising-ceasing appearance manner has two:
[11841] This and
[11842] The bardo.
[11843] When diligent individuals take into experience in this life,
[11844] That ground abiding in the heart, the inner tone ground-appearance aspect light-essence and outer space appearing as impure samsara gate dharmata directly appears chiefly,
[11845] Light-appearance and
[11846] Outer earth stones inner elaborations etc. appear to senses.
[11847] The appearance and awareness experiences when taking the wisdom gate into experience.
[11848] Light-like appearance experience increasing above.
[11849] Form-like appearance, rigpa reaches measure.
[11850] At the time of dharmata exhaustion, appears as non-dual and beyond-extremes.
[11851] Compassion-like appearance, all times inner wisdom and arising compassions.
[11852] These complete, outer ground-appearance essence dissolves, ground original liberation.
[11853] In the bardo first, that ground appears as primordial purity appearance,
[11854] Ground-appearance aspect appears as clear light,
[11855] From spontaneous presence appearance form-like appearance gathers.
[11856] Wisdom and light-like appearance four practices.
[11857] From spontaneous presence jewel appearance pure wisdom and
[11858] Impure samsara gate two.
[11859] Knowing self-face, compassion and
[11860] Non-dual and
[11861] Beyond-extremes-like appearance,
[11862] Dissolves into power-ground, liberation.
[11863] Thus because ground-appearance exists in ground, when taking into experience and
[11864] Bardo and
[11865] First when deluded as sentient being, whatever, the essential point of eight mode appearance arising exists.
[11866] Buddhas and sentient beings too are only appearance self-face knowing or not,
[11867] Samsara nirvana rigpa cause one, like palm and back of hand.
[11868] This present appearance too from impure gate appearance like eight examples of illusion only,
[11869] Outer inner objectless ground-free equal wide only,
[11870] Need not abandon.
[11871] Need not adopt, when other appearance arises traceless great self-reversal,
[11872] Like waking from sleep dreams reverse,
[11873] Self-reversal to ground-liberation, going to primordial emptiness alone, understanding one essential point well, effortless universal liberation.
[11874] Third, demonstrating dissolution into the primordial ground:
[11875] Thus the great appearances arising from ground, whether knowing self-face or not,
[11876] Like crystal light dissolving inward,
[11877] Like former dream ceasing when latter appears, passing through the yol,
[11878] All appearance gone to nothing,
[11879] From original tone inward reversal,
[11880] Not going elsewhere,
[11881] Like not going elsewhere from dissolving in the nature of two dreams.
[11882] Moreover, when particularly awake, dream appearances knowing inwardly dissolve, not going elsewhere anywhere.
[11883] How is the dissolution manner?
[11884] From the Precious Heap Tantra:
[11885] <prose><tantra> "Alas, Vajra Speech listen,
[11886] <prose><tantra> All these fault-virtue appearance manners,
[11887] <prose><tantra> Rigpa's own virtue or
[11888] <prose><tantra> Play power dissolution manner eight.
[11889] <prose><tantra> Spontaneous presence ground without certainty,
[11890] <prose><tantra> Virtue manner thus thus.
[11891] <prose><tantra> Compassion itself to compassion,
[11892] <prose><tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11893] <prose><tantra> Without establishment obtaining manner,
[11894] <prose><tantra> Passes to actionless expanse.
[11895] <prose><tantra> Non-acting, nothing at all,
[11896] <prose><tantra> All activities nirvana.
[11897] <prose><tantra> Unmade action without appearance,
[11898] <prose><tantra> All compounded pure expanse.
[11899] <prose><tantra> That itself self-dissolved to self,
[11900] <prose><tantra> Not going elsewhere.
[11901] <prose><tantra> For example, to the sun's heart,
[11902] <prose><tantra> Its own rays self-dissolve like,
[11903] <prose><tantra> With its own tone included,
[11904] <prose><tantra> All dream-appearances nirvana.
[11905] <prose><tantra> All these virtue precious jewel,
[11906] <prose><tantra> Not abiding in fault, own ground.
[11907] <prose><tantra> Self-light self-dissolved,
[11908] <prose><tantra> This too appears as great virtue.
[11909] <prose><tantra> Self-nature utterly pure,
[11910] <prose><tantra> Marks holding attachment objects cease.
[11911] <prose><tantra> Though outer four elements coarse,
[11912] <prose><tantra> Not seen here, attachment reverses.
[11913] <prose><tantra> From self-pure great emptiness,
[11914] <prose><tantra> Color self-grasping nirvana.
[11915] <prose><tantra> This too not gone elsewhere,
[11916] <prose><tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11917] <prose><tantra> All appearances nirvana.
[11918] <prose><tantra> Light mandala self-dissolved,
[11919] <prose><tantra> For example, sky rainbow itself,
[11920] <prose><tantra> Like self-dissolving in sky itself,
[11921] <prose><tantra> In great non-discriminating expanse,
[11922] <prose><tantra> All grasping attachments nirvana.
[11923] <prose><tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11924] <prose><tantra> Virtue manner thus thus.
[11925] <prose><tantra> Wisdom itself to wisdom,
[11926] <prose><tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11927] <prose><tantra> Awareness grasping thoughts memories,
[11928] <prose><tantra> Self-abiding equality expanse,
[11929] <prose><tantra> All non-dual nirvana.
[11930] <prose><tantra> Individual wisdom appearance aspects too,
[11931] <prose><tantra> In the center of unmade expanse,
[11932] <prose><tantra> Without ceasing nirvana.
[11933] <prose><tantra> That itself self-dissolved to self,
[11934] <prose><tantra> All wisdom play diversities,
[11935] <prose><tantra> Self-face not-dissolved is
[11936] <prose><tantra> Like child entering mother's lap,
[11937] <prose><tantra> Self-wisdom self-confidence,
[11938] <prose><tantra> Self-nature nirvana.
[11939] <prose><tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11940] <prose><tantra> Also virtue dissolution manner.
[11941] <prose><tantra> Body itself body self-dissolved,
[11942] <prose><tantra> All forms non-conceptual great,
[11943] <prose><tantra> Without appearance nirvana.
[11944] <prose><tantra> Coarse included elements and
[11945] <prose><tantra> Subtle held non-recognition etc.
[11946] <prose><tantra> Without action nirvana.
[11947] <prose><tantra> Bodies self-face dissolved,
[11948] <prose><tantra> Awareness arising aspect not straying outward.
[11949] <prose><tantra> Like vase body form example,
[11950] <prose><tantra> Inner clear outer movements
[11951] <prose><tantra> Nature extinguished in own place.
[11952] <prose><tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11953] <prose><tantra> Also virtue thus thus.
[11954] <prose><tantra> Non-dual non-dual self-dissolved,
[11955] <prose><tantra> Number-grasping attachments
[11956] <prose><tantra> Unique free from elaborations
[11957] <prose><tantra> Non-two one manner too
[11958] <prose><tantra> Self-dissolved nirvana.
[11959] <prose><tantra> Two-appearing self-dissolved,
[11960] <prose><tantra> Like river to river
[11961] <prose><tantra> Dissolving like, not dividing difference,
[11962] <prose><tantra> Non-divided great nirvana.
[11963] <prose><tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11964] <prose><tantra> Unceasing virtue thus thus.
[11965] <prose><tantra> Beyond-extremes itself to beyond-extremes,
[11966] <prose><tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11967] <prose><tantra> All body-speech grasping continuums,
[11968] <prose><tantra> Bodies exhausted nirvana.
[11969] <prose><tantra> Extreme itself self-pure self-dissolved,
[11970] <prose><tantra> Like sky to sky
[11971] <prose><tantra> Dissolving like, no face grasping,
[11972] <prose><tantra> Four extreme thought-attachments self-ceased,
[11973] <prose><tantra> Non-abiding great nirvana.
[11974] <prose><tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11975] <prose><tantra> Appearance virtue thus thus.
[11976] <prose><tantra> Impure samsara self-entry gate,
[11977] <prose><tantra> To essence's pure gate,
[11978] <prose><tantra> Dissolve in manner of not going.
[11979] <prose><tantra> Like bird snare threads,
[11980] <prose><tantra> Gathered by tamer to center like,
[11981] <prose><tantra> Sense activity objects nirvana.
[11982] <prose><tantra> This itself virtue precious jewel,
[11983] <prose><tantra> Thus virtue aspects complete.
[11984] <prose><tantra> Pure wisdom gate itself,
[11985] <prose><tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11986] <prose><tantra> Body and wisdom nirvana.
[11987] <prose><tantra> Like lion touching snow,
[11988] <prose><tantra> Non-returning fearlessness confidence obtained.
[11989] <prose><tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11990] <prose><tantra> Thus virtue arising manner's
[11991] <prose><tantra> Abiding as one wisdom ground,
[11992] <prose><tantra> Unsought self-finding,
[11993] <prose><tantra> Primordially that own nature."
[11994] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[11995] This manner is the difficult point of Secret Essence Heart Drop;
[11996] Though clearly taught in tantras and oral instructions,
[11997] Not even slight ability arose here in Tibet before,
[11998] Therefore I have clearly distinguished and taught it;
[11999] Henceforth knowing this essential point, know the power of these words.
[12000] Second, Samantabhadra's liberation manner has three:
[12001] The manner of liberation in the instant of seeing ground-appearance,
[12002] The manner of abiding in the expanse after liberation,
[12003] The manner of benefiting others from that.
[12004] The first:
[12005] From the primordial expanse,
[12006] Inner tone outwardly projected,
[12007] Compassion-rigpa self-non-recognition aspect arisen just that, looking outward to ground-appearance,
[12008] In the instant of recognizing this as one's own appearance inwardly,
[12009] Non-recognition self-pure from ground-appearance spontaneous presence manner self-dissolved, abiding self-place in primordial purity ground.
[12010] Moreover, distinguishing particularities in the instant of self-appearance,
[12011] Buddha in an instant,
[12012] The Teacher who came before as playful,
[12013] From the Talgyur:
[12014] <prose><tantra> "Thus samsara and nirvana from beginning and end,
[12015] <prose><tantra> Buddha not deluded,
[12016] <prose><tantra> By faculties transcending ground,
[12017] <prose><tantra> Self-appearance natureless known,
[12018] <prose><tantra> Thought investigation mind not straying outward,
[12019] <prose><tantra> Movement self-decided."
[12020] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12021] From Gongpa Khandro Gyud:
[12022] <prose><tantra> "At that time Samantabhadra six dharmas,
[12023] <prose><tantra> Ground known, six non-recognitions conquered,
[12024] <prose><tantra> Merely calm mind merely empty,
[12025] <prose><tantra> Merely rigpa arising, rigpa-decrease destroyed,
[12026] <prose><tantra> By clarity clear, darkness dispelled,
[12027] <prose><tantra> By ease arising, no thickening,
[12028] <prose><tantra> Free from additions, non-recognition pure,
[12029] <prose><tantra> Unchanging like sky.
[12030] <prose><tantra> Moreover, Vajrasattva listen,
[12031] <prose><tantra> Delusion non-recognition reversed conquered,
[12032] <prose><tantra> Neutral self-destroyed empty,
[12033] <prose><tantra> Inert-rigpa distinguished, ground and meet,
[12034] <prose><tantra> Therefore non-recognition darkness dispelled,
[12035] <prose><tantra> Like sun rising on mountain."
[12036] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12037] From Self-Arisen Bliss Wheel Tantra:
[12038] <prose><tantra> "From merely calm rigpa arising,
[12039] <prose><tantra> By ease clear, free from additions."
[12040] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12041] From Mayajala:
[12042] <prose><tantra> "In one instant particularities distinguished,
[12043] <prose><tantra> In one instant complete Buddha."
[12044] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12045] Though renowned that Samantabhadra Buddha without doing even a particle of virtue from ground primordially,
[12046] Analyzing, knowing self-face is the ocean of uncontrived self-arisen virtue,
[12047] Great accumulations originally complete,
[12048] Neutral non-recognition dispelled, obscurations primordially conquered,
[12049] Knowing as self-appearance, non-recognition dispelled,
[12050] That dispelled, all afflictions dispelled,
[12051] Because arising from dispelled non-recognition.
[12052] At that time, self-abiding virtue manifestly arisen, Buddha in body and wisdom.
[12053] Saying liberated primordially from ground is rough,
[12054] Because liberated when ground-appearance arises from ground,
[12055] Liberated in the instant transcending ground.
[12056] Where liberated?
[12057] Saying liberated primordially from ground is also rough,
[12058] Liberated in the place of ultimate spontaneous presence.
[12059] If liberated primordially from ground, would reverse,
[12060] Because ground established as capable of delusion arising,
[12061] Because ground of samsara and nirvana.
[12062] Liberation place itself is the beginning,
[12063] Is ground the beginning?
[12064] Explained as beginning in nature, but
[12065] Not the first ground.
[12066] In brief, when knowing self-face, expanse virtue ultimate,
[12067] Liberated as fruition free from obscurations.
[12068] Therefore body, wisdom etc. virtues arising ground-abiding measure called expanse virtue,
[12069] Existing in rigpa, but
[12070] Because not manifest.
[12071] At completion time called Buddha virtue,
[12072] Because dispelled non-recognition, by dispelled power own virtues appearing, expanded.
[12073] Or ground spontaneous presence Buddha virtue and
[12074] Fruition manifest accomplished Buddha virtue assertion.
[12075] Thus Samantabhadra Buddha,
[12076] Six dharmas:
[12077] Transcending ground,
[12078] Self-face appearance,
[12079] Distinguishing particularities,
[12080] Liberated above distinguishing,
[12081] Not arising from other,
[12082] Abiding self-place.
[12083] These too, fruition not arising from cause,
[12084] Buddha not arising from mind,
[12085] Oral instruction not arising from scripture, self-arisen, Buddha.
[12086] Original ground and ground-appearance fruition liberation,
[12087] Done by realizing wisdom,
[12088] From the Blazing Lamp Tantra:
[12089] <prose><tantra> "Ground itself ripening as fruition is wisdom,
[12090] <prose><tantra> Wisdom ripening as body,
[12091] <prose><tantra> That essence nature dharmakaya,
[12092] <prose><tantra> Ripens as wisdom dharmakaya.
[12093] <prose><tantra> By that wisdom stream unceasing,
[12094] <prose><tantra> Body and wisdom spontaneous presence clear."
[12095] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12096] At that time, all aspects of knowable objects appearing outwardly, knowing self-face inwardly, all-knowing Buddha,
[12097] Self-face abiding inner-clear as youthful vase body, from dharmata nature,
[12098] Investigating fabrications peaceful, all-knowing Buddha.
[12099] Though knowing all, not moving from self-face dharmata,
[12100] Inner abiding awareness and
[12101] Outer seeing awareness aspects,
[12102] By aspect appearing not appearing difference,
[12103] All-knowing wisdom and
[12104] All-aspect-knowing wisdom and
[12105] All-aspect-knowing wisdom called.
[12106] These two reversal different, essence one, inner abiding all-knowing.
[12107] Second, the manner of abiding in the expanse after liberation:
[12108] Primordial purity spontaneous presence virtue manifestly arisen, like crystal light gathered inward,
[12109] Self-face inner-clear youthful vase body abiding,
[12110] Dharmakaya primordial purity essence centerless boundless expanse height great expanse,
[12111] Within spontaneous presence depth-clear five lights palace arrangement,
[12112] Rigpa empty aspect dharmata Samantabhadri, appearance aspect dharmakaya Samantabhadra self-clear,
[12113] Method and wisdom net self-connected,
[12114] Wisdom life-horse established, swift,
[12115] Five clear light inner tone unmixed, equal nature wide,
[12116] That itself unceasing, secret sun shines in expanse.
[12117] At that time, expanse five elements self-place arranged, appearance and light self-tone clear,
[12118] Depth-clear tone unceasing,
[12119] Five wisdom lights curled in expanse,
[12120] Not established as things and marks, empty,
[12121] Not cut off as non-existence, well-braided,
[12122] Essence nature compassion three knots braided as one,
[12123] Rigpa light house possessor,
[12124] Light endless appearance spontaneous thick,
[12125] Liberated wisdom endless victory banner peak, ten powers,
[12126] Four fearlessnesses,
[12127] Individual knowing,
[12128] Marks,
[12129] Minor marks etc. never-ceasing nature,
[12130] Light rays endless lamp clear,
[12131] Self-appearance wisdom without increase decrease,
[12132] Great compassion benefit-intending path other not traveled, self-clear,
[12133] Five body stupas five wisdom terraces,
[12134] Not moving from dharmata seat expanse,
[12135] Skillful method great compassion empty path directions end-reached all-pervading,
[12136] Buddha and sentient beings all teacher, first, primordially abides.
[12137] Moreover, from Self-Arisen:
[12138] <prose><tantra> "Alas, supreme being, speaking lion, you listen,
[12139] <prose><tantra> Jewel arrangement heap body height great,
[12140] <prose><tantra> Jewel palace arrangement excellent,
[12141] <prose><tantra> Jewel adorned queen ornaments beautiful,
[12142] <prose><tantra> Jewel arrangement net equal,
[12143] <prose><tantra> Jewel beautiful horse swift,
[12144] <prose><tantra> On jewel various terrace inexhaustible,
[12145] <prose><tantra> Jewel five color plain all equal,
[12146] <prose><tantra> Jewel secret sun arising ceasing none,
[12147] <prose><tantra> Jewel water lotus stain none,
[12148] <prose><tantra> Jewel fire mandala stacked excellent,
[12149] <prose><tantra> Jewel wind wisdom thought none,
[12150] <prose><tantra> Jewel earth mandala vehicle great,
[12151] <prose><tantra> Jewel sky centerless boundless,
[12152] <prose><tantra> Jewel blazing light arising ceasing none,
[12153] <prose><tantra> Jewel ray garland root excellent,
[12154] <prose><tantra> Jewel empty mandala drawn excellent,
[12155] <prose><tantra> Jewel extreme three knots braided excellent,
[12156] <prose><tantra> Jewel depth darkness dispelling wide spontaneous thick,
[12157] <prose><tantra> Jewel ocean peak unceasing,
[12158] <prose><tantra> Jewel blazing lamp clear light,
[12159] <prose><tantra> Jewel secret wisdom increase decrease none,
[12160] <prose><tantra> Jewel connection path untravelable,
[12161] <prose><tantra> Jewel body relic blazing stupa stacked excellent,
[12162] <prose><tantra> Jewel vajra seat unchanging,
[12163] <prose><tantra> Jewel empty path end-reached none,
[12164] <prose><tantra> Self-abiding oral instruction taught."
[12165] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12166] These in Thigle Sangkor, earth jewel five color stupa etc. stacked excellent, accord.
[12167] Third, benefiting others from that:
[12168] From dharmakaya field primordial purity great expanse not moving,
[12169] Spontaneous presence gate sentient being appearance manner accompanying, benefit done,
[12170] Spontaneous presence light body power Sambhogakaya appearance arranged,
[12171] From that Brahma great eon arranged,
[12172] Natural Nirmanakaya appearance and
[12173] Impure samsara gate wandering being appearance manner tamer Teacher sentient being realms pervading demonstrated, samsara emptied.
[12174] These appear in common vehicles too,
[12175] From Uttaratantra:
[12176] <prose><tantra> "Uncompounded spontaneously accomplished,
[12177] <prose><tantra> Other condition realization not,
[12178] <prose><tantra> Possessing knowledge, love, and power,
[12179] <prose><tantra> Buddha possessing two benefits,
[12180] <prose><tantra> Beginning, middle, end none,
[12181] <prose><tantra> Nature therefore uncompounded,
[12182] <prose><tantra> Peaceful dharmakaya possessing,
[12183] <prose><tantra> Spontaneously accomplished called.
[12184] <prose><tantra> Self individual realizing,
[12185] <prose><tantra> Other condition realization not,
[12186] <prose><tantra> Thus three realizing knowledge,
[12187] <prose><tantra> Path showing therefore love,
[12188] <prose><tantra> Power wisdom compassion by,
[12189] <prose><tantra> Suffering affliction dispelling.
[12190] <prose><tantra> First three self-benefit,
[12191] <prose><tantra> Latter three other-benefit."
[12192] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12193] Its commentary:
[12194] <prose><tantra> "Thus extremely marvelous, inconceivable object Buddha,
[12195] <prose><tantra> Without hearing from other, self Teacher-less, self-arisen wisdom indescribable nature manifestly complete Buddha,
[12196] <prose><tantra> Following that, realizing and non-realizing blind others too, for realizing,
[12197] <prose><tantra> For teaching path to that realization,
[12198] <prose><tantra> Unsurpassed wisdom and
[12199] <prose><tantra> Compassion possessing thus know."
[12200] <prose><tantra> Thus taught.
[12201] Such Teacher, first before all, attaining enlightenment,
[12202] Three times Buddhas and
[12203] Three realms sentient beings all benefit done,
[12204] Beginning and end none abiding, complete dominion Teacher Samantabhadra called.
[12205] Field and activity dharmadhatu sky-end reaching, sentient being and Buddha appearance however much, that much.
[12206] Third, the manner of non-recognition sentient being delusion:
[12207] Though no delusion in primordial ground, when ground-appearance arises, self-face non-recognition awareness neutral with rigpa root,
[12208] Ground-appearance divided into types, deluded as sentient being;
[12209] From the Garland of Pearls:
[12210] <prose><tantra> "From the greatly distinguished appearance,
[12211] <prose><tantra> Existence and non-existence two arise,
[12212] <prose><tantra> Common ground delusion called,
[12213] <prose><tantra> Because of being mixed with non-recognition itself,
[12214] <prose><tantra> Knowables themselves appear as stains."
[12215] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12216] <prose><tantra> "Upon dharmakaya like sky,
[12217] <prose><tantra> Adventitious sentient being clouds obscure,
[12218] <prose><tantra> Non-deluded dharmata too
[12219] <prose><tantra> Appears as deluded manner to mind."
[12220] <prose><tantra> Cause, condition, with instantaneous,
[12221] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12222] From Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra:
[12223] <prose><tantra> "Three realm sentient beings all
[12224] <prose><tantra> From ground not-anything deluded as anything.
[12225] <prose><tantra> That ground essence empty,
[12226] <prose><tantra> By nature clear,
[12227] <prose><tantra> Compassion sentient being appearing capable."
[12228] <prose><tantra> From that, grasping-maker awareness from non-recognition aspect arising, slight stir,
[12229] <prose><tantra> Dark awareness that father from me arose or,
[12230] <prose><tantra> From me that father arose, awareness arising just deluded.
[12231] <prose><tantra> That non-recognition not in ground, in experience or aspect exists.
[12232] <prose><tantra> From aspect four conditions arise.
[12233] <prose><tantra> Moreover, ground-light house abiding called causal condition,
[12234] <prose><tantra> Non-recognition itself.
[12235] <prose><tantra> From that investigation gone, dominating condition called.
[12236] <prose><tantra> From that object-possessor held, observed condition called,
[12237] <prose><tantra> Like demonstrating man's face in mirror example.
[12238] <prose><tantra> These three time-equal, immediately-after condition called.
[12239] <prose><tantra> That own ground, self not knowing, deluded, three realms samsara accomplished.
[12240] <prose><tantra> From that afflictions coarse gone, sentient being forms different arose.
[12241] <prose><tantra> From such ground deluded."
[12242] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12243] Moreover, when investigating awareness arises toward ground-appearance,
[12244] From cause self-one non-recognition self-face not knowing aspect,
[12245] Four conditions observation impure deluded.
[12246] These manners from Auspicious Beautiful:
[12247] <prose><tantra> "Moreover, by condition-ground deluded,
[12248] <prose><tantra> End too touches four conditions.
[12249] <prose><tantra> From cause observation-possessor grasping condition,
[12250] <prose><tantra> Diverse result cause deluded.
[12251] <prose><tantra> Dominating object-possessor grasping condition, names diverse deluded.
[12252] <prose><tantra> Observing mind-possessor grasping condition, result-reaching none deluded.
[12253] <prose><tantra> Immediately-after grasping-possessor condition, appearances diverse deluded."
[12254] <prose><tantra> This is the great ground delusion manner of Secret Mantra.
[12255] <prose><tantra> Moreover, appearance manner non-recognition condition self self-possessing appears.
[12256] <prose><tantra> That non-recognition too, five root afflictions possessing, gathers many elaborations.
[12257] <prose><tantra> Conditions ten thousand possessing,
[12258] <prose><tantra> Appearance manners many possessing,
[12259] <prose><tantra> Appearance manner spread.
[12260] <prose><tantra> Moreover, from spontaneous presence jewel casket nature appearance unceasing,
[12261] <prose><tantra> Ground unchanging, appearance changes,
[12262] <prose><tantra> Following many objects,
[12263] <prose><tantra> All conceptualizing.
[12264] <prose><tantra> Dharmakaya appearance unchanging,
[12265] <prose><tantra> Delusion appearance seems changing.
[12266] <prose><tantra> Vajrasattva not possessing delusion,
[12267] <prose><tantra> Showing delusion manner to sentient beings."
[12268] <prose><tantra> End self-own appearance self-condition ground reversal.
[12269] <prose><tantra> Non-dual appearance self-appearing not known,
[12270] <prose><tantra> Grasping delusion as master, dominating condition.
[12271] <prose><tantra> Self-rigpa result self-appearing not known,
[12272] <prose><tantra> Cause held as dependent, causal condition.
[12273] <prose><tantra> Object and awareness empty not known,
[12274] <prose><tantra> Observing held as object, observed own condition.
[12275] <prose><tantra> Time not known as self-light self-arisen,
[12276] <prose><tantra> That not that, holding awareness arises,
[12277] <prose><tantra> Equal immediately-after condition."
[12278] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12279] Moreover, first delusion cause three non-recognitions:
[12280] From self-face non-recognition aspect just, grasping-fixation not arising, meaning not deluded called, that deluded gone,
[12281] Nameless gone to name like, cause self-one non-recognition.
[12282] That itself not knowing just, together-born non-recognition, samsara nirvana two appearances arising.
[12283] Thus object light-appearance mind two-appearing just distinguished aspect, name object self-grasping aspect gone, imputed non-recognition called.
[12284] Such cause, conditions four:
[12285] Causal condition thus three non-recognitions gathered done,
[12286] Like self-face body limbs possessing man's face demonstrating.
[12287] From that observed condition like mirror, outer object outwardly projected,
[12288] From that face existing, condition mirror inwardly appearing like,
[12289] Observed object self-light outwardly projected from,
[12290] Dominating condition mirror and
[12291] Face and
[12292] Self actually held as face and mirror thought like,
[12293] Light and
[12294] Rigpa and
[12295] Dharmata three thought possessing, dominating condition called.
[12296] Thus cause non-recognition three, conditions three time-equal,
[12297] Equal immediately-after condition,
[12298] Delusion actually arisen.
[12299] These four conditions individual time,
[12300] Cause Buddha sentient being one, beyond abandonment-acceptance wisdom self-recognized,
[12301] Causal condition self-place liberated.
[12302] Objects diverse appearing dharmata self-appearance liberated from,
[12303] Observed condition objects different self-place liberated.
[12304] Moreover, manner self-arisen wisdom appearing liberated from,
[12305] Dominating condition self-place liberated.
[12306] Time certainty none, time early late mutually contradicting,
[12307] Equal immediately-after condition self-place liberated.
[12308] Thus cause condition two delusion nature done,
[12309] These two ripening result body done, gathered different arise,
[12310] Mind cause done, conceptions objects different from,
[12311] Object mind different deluded,
[12312] Body mind possessing that too first instant deluded.
[12313] This itself samsara beginning,
[12314] From Talgyur:
[12315] <prose><tantra> "Samsara all beginning,
[12316] <prose><tantra> From non-discriminating unmade nature,
[12317] <prose><tantra> Observing-grasping object arises,
[12318] <prose><tantra> Thought-grasping from different appears.
[12319] <prose><tantra> Observing-grasping connection twelve
[12320] <prose><tantra> Samsara beginning itself.
[12321] <prose><tantra> Three non-recognitions delusion manner,
[12322] <prose><tantra> Transmitted undiscriminating root,
[12323] <prose><tantra> Self-face not knowing,
[12324] <prose><tantra> This too samsara beginning."
[12325] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12326] At that time, twelve dependent-origination manner arisen,
[12327] Compassion power self-face not knowing three non-recognitions arisen is non-recognition.
[12328] Four conditions samsara compounded.
[12329] From that awareness coarse object aspect engaging consciousness.
[12330] From that karma different body and name arisen is name and form.
[12331] That distinctions color element individual aspects established six sense-bases.
[12332] From that object engaging contact.
[12333] From that joy grief middle three arising feeling.
[12334] From that pleasure desiring, suffering not wanting awareness craving.
[12335] From that object accepting grasping.
[12336] From that karma and afflictions increase, future birth projecting karma becoming accomplished is becoming.
[12337] From that wandering different born is birth.
[12338] From that mature aging and dying aging and death.
[12339] That too first from my twelve wheels deluded.
[12340] One life too clear light ceasing, existence bardo appearance possible first instant self-face not knowing non-recognition,
[12341] Outer breath cut dying,
[12342] That between dependent-origination manner entered.
[12343] From that coarse subtle dissolution manner casket male stages reversed,
[12344] Delusion appearance ceasing, samsara returning,
[12345] Nirvana self-arisen nature first primordial purity appearance arising,
[12346] Dharmata bardo appearances primordial nirvana dependent-origination manifestly appearing.
[12347] There self-face not knowing too deluded,
[12348] Knowing liberated, samsara experience nirvana liberated called.
[12349] That too ground and ground-appearance
[12350] Both non-recognition not existing, like clouds adventitiously arisen,
[12351] Impure samsara gate manner arising cause done,
[12352] Three realms six migrations individually deluded.
[12353] From the Garland of Pearls:
[12354] <prose><tantra> "Upon such abiding dharmata,
[12355] <prose><tantra> Delusion primordially not existing,
[12356] <prose><tantra> Dharmakaya like sky,
[12357] <prose><tantra> Adventitious sentient being clouds obscured."
[12358] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12359] From ground-appearance great that itself,
[12360] <prose><tantra> Non-recognition imputed not,
[12361] <prose><tantra> Delusion accomplished not existing."
[12362] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12363] Adventitiously forcefully imputed, impure samsara dharma arisen,
[12364] From that itself:
[12365] <prose><tantra> "Thus three worlds themselves,
[12366] <prose><tantra> Five aggregates and five senses,
[12367] <prose><tantra> Five limbs and five essences,
[12368] <prose><tantra> Five objects and five afflictions,
[12369] <prose><tantra> Five minds five mentations five thoughts,
[12370] <prose><tantra> Grasping-fixation samsara itself accomplished."
[12371] <prose><tantra> Thus and,
[12372] <prose><tantra> "Earth water fire wind space too,
[12373] <prose><tantra> Great elements from that arisen.
[12374] <prose><tantra> Gods and titans humans,
[12375] <prose><tantra> Hells animals hungry ghosts,
[12376] <prose><tantra> Great from that truly arisen.
[12377] <prose><tantra> Desire anger delusion,
[12378] <prose><tantra> Pride jealousy etc.
[12379] <prose><tantra> From that miracle arises.
[12380] <prose><tantra> Non-recognition sentient being minds,
[12381] <prose><tantra> Aggregates elements and sense-bases,
[12382] <prose><tantra> Consciousness collections and,
[12383] <prose><tantra> Five senses etc. arisen.
[12384] <prose><tantra> Sound and smell and taste,
[12385] <prose><tantra> Touch and desirable objects,
[12386] <prose><tantra> From that in the manner of karma arisen.
[12387] <prose><tantra> Hoard and Yama stick and,
[12388] <prose><tantra> Essence-none etc. too,
[12389] <prose><tantra> From that power and play arisen.
[12390] <prose><tantra> Alaya and appropriation's
[12391] <prose><tantra> Flesh and blood and lymph,
[12392] <prose><tantra> Bones and skin and hair,
[12393] <prose><tantra> Gathered bodies from that arisen."
[12394] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[12395] At that time six non-recognitions too self-possessed arise,
[12396] From Self-Arisen:
[12397] <prose><tantra> "Non-recognition thus:
[12398] <prose><tantra> Root mind non-recognition,
[12399] <prose><tantra> Delusion object non-recognition,
[12400] <prose><tantra> Delusion-ground ground non-recognition,
[12401] <prose><tantra> Grasping thought non-recognition,
[12402] <prose><tantra> Fabrication path non-recognition,
[12403] <prose><tantra> Not knowing ignorance non-recognition,
[12404] <prose><tantra> Thus non-recognition six types arise,
[12405] <prose><tantra> Self-appearance not seeing.
[12406] <prose><tantra> Moreover thus:
[12407] <prose><tantra> Root mind non-recognition is together-born actual,
[12408] <prose><tantra> Rigpa wisdom not knowing deluded,
[12409] <prose><tantra> To me wisdom appearance this arose or,
[12410] <prose><tantra> My appearance this not thus awareness arising,
[12411] <prose><tantra> Arrogance arising, together-born root non-recognition,
[12412] <prose><tantra> Self-grasping thought arising, deluded.
[12413] <prose><tantra> From that rigpa wisdom appearance obscured.
[12414] <prose><tantra> That is root mind non-recognition called.
[12415] <prose><tantra> Now delusion object non-recognition demonstrated:
[12416] <prose><tantra> Delusion by what deluded?
[12417] <prose><tantra> Object first world not-yet-established,
[12418] <prose><tantra> Wish-fulfilling tree spreading called,
[12419] <prose><tantra> Buddha youthful vase body blessing arisen tree,
[12420] <prose><tantra> Egg-born warmth moisture born from,
[12421] <prose><tantra> From that mind self-arisen wisdom called, stirred, this world established.
