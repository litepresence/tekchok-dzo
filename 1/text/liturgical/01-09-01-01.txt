[11335] From the Rangshar:
<tantra> [11336] That all essence, the primordially pure actual state, is called.
<tantra> [11337] India also—uncut, directionless, not falling anywhere.
<tantra> [11338] Below that, the spontaneous presence jewel casket exists, and
<tantra> [11339] Within that, the arising manner has six forms.
<tantra> [11340] The gate has two forms.
<tantra> [11341] That base is called spontaneous presence.
<tantra> [11342] The base not certain is called.
<tantra> [11343] The base various arising is also called.
<tantra> [11344] Below that, the reverse ground exists.
<tantra> [11345] Below that, the base appearance great exists.
<tantra> [11346] Below that, the enjoyment body appearance exists—thus it was spoken.
[11347] Here, if that meaning is elaborately explained:
[11348] Beginning with the expanse, the youth vase body inside essence abides as body.
[11349] Nature abides as speech.
[11350] Compassion abides as mind.
[11351] That also, possessing life-wind limbs four, the essence awareness of the five wisdom winds abides, resonating and appearing outside.
[11352] The youth vase body, limitless and inseparable from spontaneous presence resonance, from the light of the five appearances, flames each arise and together.
[11353] Compassion, awareness resonance form, investigates and knowledge arises—that also.
[11354] Self-face not knowing, just part from awareness depending, is called ignorance and abides.
[11355] That word, base not changing, although the base appears arising, change change similar becomes is.
[11356] Awareness appearance changing is called.
[11357] At that time, the primordially pure appearance, like sky without clouds, from a state like not existing,
[11358] The spontaneous presence arising manner eight self-appearances arise.
[11359] The jewel casket actual state is the great appearance.
[11360] Compassion, like arising understanding not ceasing, sentient being compassion arises.
[11361] Light, like arising understanding not ceasing, the five wisdoms self-light rainbow-like appearance pervades.
[11362] Wisdom, like arising understanding not ceasing, not-thinking state abides.
[11363] Body, like arising understanding not ceasing, peaceful-wrathful light-clear body pervades the sky.
[11364] Two not existing, like arising understanding not ceasing, one and many not investigated.



[11365] Extreme-free, like appearing's door not ceased, spontaneous self-face-in clear.
[11366] Pure primordial wisdom's door, like appearing's door not ceased, entity primordially pure's appearance, sky cloud not-like appearance above sees.
[11367] Impure samsara's door, like appearing's door not ceased, below the six classes' appearance-portion appears.
[11368] Samsara lower realms play-to primordially arise.
[11369] In the said manner.
[11370] Thus from spontaneous appearance's capacity, in the five primordial wisdoms' field, the enjoyment body's appearance measure not, also directly self-clear.
[11371] From quality's capacity, from direction-corner in nature emanation body's field, appearance also inferred-to, not self-arisen.
[11372] From compassion's capacity, from below to sentient being appearance also measure not, self-to appear.
[11373] Thus this-like ground-appearance clear-to, directly appearing like mirror-to form-reflection arisen.
[11374] Self-to appear, other-to not-appear, self-appearance-to not-know, like dream's appearance.
[11375] Flickering confused scattered arise.
[11376] Self-side not-grasped moment instant.
[11377] That also below primordially pure's spontaneous appearance.
[11378] Below that-of, to the light-clear five's thig-le and ray-radiance appearance, ground early great exists.
[11379] Below that-of, the enjoyment body's appearance.
[11380] Below that-of, the nature emanation body's appearance exists.
[11381] Below that-of, the six modes' appearance and.
[11382] Below that, tame beings-tame emanation body muni six and.
[11383] Impure emanation body birth aging death tame-by-means-of field appearance exists.
[11384] That spontaneous arising-way eight that arise's ground.
[11385] Being's bag filling like.
[11386] That ga'u-of sound expressed.
[11387] That also from the bkra-shis mdzes-ldan great's tantra.
<tantra> [11388] Alas, fatigue confusion not also, from I-of capacity confusion arisen.
<tantra> [11389] From ground not-change,
<tantra> [11390] From nature not-cease arise,
<tantra> [11391] From compassion-by-means-of not-determinate from non-awareness self-arise.



[11392] For example, like clouds in the sky truly existing not, clouds adventitiously arise.
[11393] Base path awareness exist truly not.
[11394] Compassion, like arising cause non-recognition arises.
[11395] Base spontaneous-accomplishment-of state called attach.
[11396] That also not-determined appearance great one-as dwells.
[11397] That also arise way aspect eight possesses.
[11398] Called the jewel casket-of state.
[11399] Desire-objects-of door not ceases.
[11400] Not establish-of establish great-as dwells.
[11401] Compassion like arise-of door not ceases.
[11402] Primordial wisdom like arise-of enjoyment not ceases.
[11403] Form like arise-of essence not ceases.
[11404] Non-dual like arise-of view not determined.
[11405] Limit liberate like arise-of method not ceases.
[11406] Pure primordial wisdom-of gate thorough reach.
[11407] Impure like arise-of compassion not ceases.
[11408] Desire-objects-of jewel jewel like.
[11409] That-like my form-to attach.
[11410] Called the inner youth vase form extent open.
[11411] Outer spontaneous-accomplishment-of state-as dwells.
[11412] Time that only my appearance outer spreads.
[11413] Clear not clear not.
[11414] Shattered not shattered not.
[11415] Scattered not scattered not.
[11416] Distracted not distracted not.
[11417] Move.
[11418] Flicker.
[11419] Variety-as spread happens.
[11420] Then spontaneous-accomplishment-of state great attaches.
[11421] That primordial wisdom-of door not ceases cause complete, enjoyment appearance way attaches.
[11422] Quality-of door not ceases cause, nature emanation form appearance way exists.
[11423] That compassion door not ceases cause, impure appearance way happens thus.
[11424] That-like appearance limit not thought not reach-of dharma great.
[11425] Light and form clear all spontaneous-thick arrange good.
[11426] Samsara-nirvana arise-of gate vast.
[11427] All contain cause cavity great.
[11428] From the Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
<tantra> [11429] Clear manifest appear majestic great.
<tantra> [11430] Appearance itself spontaneous lovely.
<tantra> [11431] Dharma-body introduce and excitement.

[11626] Hatred black-from hell-in form-do.
[11627] Thus types six appearance-in form-do.
[11628] That cyclic-existence place-is.
[11629] That-also base-mode great one-from appearance-mode four like arisen-are.
[11630] Base-mode four-from appearance-means four like manifest-do.

[11637] That all gather-if,
[11638] Primordial-purity-from cloud not-having space like appearance under.
[11639] Spontaneous-presence door eight emergence-mode-from primordial-awareness appearance enjoyment-kaya and.
[11640] That potency-from directly five-families appearance measureless-from.
[11641] Nature emanation-kaya appearance-in.
[11642] Downward six realms pure-lands teacher and having.

[11647] Self-appearance six-realms appearance also other-in not-exist that impure cyclic-existence door like emergence-mode not-cease-from self-arise-therefore.



[11648] Thus self self-to appearance this is-although.
[11649] Common agreeing world part common karma and.
[11650] Teacher activity-by arrange-in.
[11651] Self-to appearance although delusion-as appearance part self-appearance cyclic-existence door-by arrange that.
[11652] Self-appearance part bundle transfer time self-reverse-to go-in.
[11653] Common other face-to now fall-in exist-do.
[11654] This two divide very important-is.
[11655] Nature awareness-to self-arise spontaneous-presence door-from six-realms appearance exist-therefore.
[11656] Deluded-appearance dream like primordial-purity ground-to appearance not-exist-as self-reverse-to send need-do point that is-in.
[11657] Bardo-in also self face six-realms-to self-appearance emanation-by benefit-do and.
[11658] Not-do part two-as explain-do is.
[11659] Impure cyclic-existence door not-manifest before self-appearance self face know-if benefit not-do that.

[11661] Manifest-from benefit need-do.
[11662] Deluded-appearance not-empty-if liberation not-able because.
[11663] Point this-also subtle very important one is.
[11664] Second fault quality proof particular explain-in three are.
[11665] Quality part eight generally show-do.
[11666] Condition-by fault quality part divide-do.
[11667] Emerge-cessation appearance-mode proof place-do.
[11668] First is.
[11669] First base-to spontaneous not-establish-if.
[11670] Base-appearance manifest-do meaning not-exist-in.
[11671] Base-appearance spontaneous-presence emergence-mode not-exist-if.
[11672] Cyclic-existence transcendence arise-do meaning not-exist-therefore.
[11673] Base and base-appearance-to inner space subtle and.
[11674] Outer space coarse-as appear-door show-do.
[11675] That-also mind light clarity space.
[11676] Spontaneous-presence self-resonance-to compassion arise-cause not-exist-if.
[11677] Cyclic-existence transcendence two faction separate that one-by one tamed and tamer not-suitable-do.
[11678] Sentient-beings self-appearance delusion.

[11681] Appearance not-one-also sentient-beings benefit arise-do base-to compassion exist base-appearance-from emerge-therefore.



[11682] Tame and tame-maker as relate is.
[11683] From the Secret-Essence:
<tantra> [11684] Great-compassion relate.
<tantra> [11685] Six-realms time abide not-remain appear.
[11686] Thus it is spoken.
[11687] Likewise light-tone awareness-of base and appear-aspect non-existent if elements five individually clear-of purpose non-existent in.
[11688] That non-existent if awareness inside in cut-off.
[11689] Element what also non-existent container-contents-of appear non-arise if.
[11690] Light like appear exist that-of quality.
[11691] Two-non-existent like non-existent if door three one-to relate cannot if.
[11692] Beings-of body speech mind three.
[11693] Buddha-of body three gather separate non-existent-of quality.
[11694] Body like appear non-existent if body as appear come purpose non-existent if beings-of body and conqueror-of body-as appear that exist-of quality.
[11695] Primordial-wisdom like appear non-existent if samsara from transcend go-of juncture join path primordial-wisdom-of appear non-existent-of defect exist if.
[11696] This exist path and primordial-wisdom four join-of appear exist that-of quality.
[11697] Extreme liberate like appear exist Buddha from back not-return arise.
[11698] That non-existent if non-arise-for also that-of quality.
[11699] Impure door like appear primordial-arise spontaneous in non-existent if.
[11700] Beings samsara-in appear awareness-face this-to come purpose non-existent if.
[11701] That exist six-realms individually-of appear-as arise also that-of quality.
[11702] Power completely great from.



[11703] <tantra> From the Power Vajra:
[11704] <tantra> Cyclic existence lower realms play-to primordially arise.
[11705] Thus it is spoken.
[11706] If the gate of pure primordial wisdom did not exist, the appearance of nirvana would have no purpose.
[11707] Because it exists, the appearance of Buddhahood in the face of awareness is the quality of its existence.
[11708] Moreover, within spontaneous presence, pure and impure both can appear.
[11709] The gate of seeing exists like a window, yet pure and impure do not exist as such in the ground itself.
[11710] Thus, when the eight modes of spontaneous presence arising are counted as eight qualities, it is reasonable.
[11711] From the Gem Treasury Tantra:



<tantra> [11712] Through the eight display-gates,
<tantra> [11713] They manifest as eight qualities.
<tantra> [11714] The six classes' escape-holes self-severed,
<tantra> [11715] Those whose life-rope to cyclic existence is cut—
<tantra> [11716] For the sake of catching them with the hook of compassion,
<tantra> [11717] To beings of the four types of birth,
<tantra> [11718] Great compassion itself appears.
<tantra> [11719] As the quality of samsara and nirvana's self-relationship,
<tantra> [11720] They appear in the manner of both aspects intermingled.
<tantra> [11721] Without this, samsara and nirvana would be severed into factions,
<tantra> [11722] Becoming the fault of non-realization.
<tantra> [11723] Thus much is the arising mode of qualities.
<tantra> [11724] Within the self-domain of all Buddhas,
<tantra> [11725] Just as body and shadow,
<tantra> [11726] Because the five lights of appearance pervade,
<tantra> [11727] The inner appearance aspect self-clear—
<tantra> [11728] From the five lights' manner of display-gate,
<tantra> [11729] Qualities clarifying without missing outward.
<tantra> [11730] Without this, beings' self-light and
<tantra> [11731] Extinction would be cut off separately.
<tantra> [11732] Because the union-display is related,
<tantra> [11733] Self-appearance arises as great quality.
<tantra> [11734] Because all bodies are gathered as one,
<tantra> [11735] The three kayas dwell as one,
<tantra> [11736] Therefore, in the nature of the essence body,
<tantra> [11737] Self-appearance not separating inward,
<tantra> [11738] The essence clarifying appears as five bodies.
<tantra> [11739] Without this, the essence would not be found,
<tantra> [11740] All bodies appear like the complete body.
<tantra> [11741] All those are not different—
<tantra> [11742] Because they dwell equally as non-dual,
<tantra> [11743] Through the appearance of indivisible non-duality,
<tantra> [11744] They appear in the manner of great pervasion throughout outer and inner.
<tantra> [11745] Without this, because self-face is different,
<tantra> [11746] The juncture of samsara and nirvana mixing would not occur.
<tantra> [11747] Because one would not be liberated from one's own ground,
<tantra> [11748] It would become the fault of no reversal-transformation.
<tantra> [11749] They appear as the manner of appearance-making quality.
<tantra> [11750] Because self-pervading all knowables,
<tantra> [11751] In the great ground-joining appearance,
<tantra> [11752] They appear as the path of samsara and nirvana's relationship.
<tantra> [11753] Without this, because ground and path would not occur,
<tantra> [11754] In the path of the four wisdoms,
<tantra> [11755] Within the secret path of beings,
<tantra> [11756] In the manner of four appearances,
<tantra> [11757] Both instantaneously and gradually,
<tantra> [11758] The gates of faculties appear as existent.
<tantra> [11759] Transcending the stains of the four extremes,
<tantra> [11760] The appearance-making quality unceasing,
<tantra> [11761] In the great extreme-free appearance mode,
<tantra> [11762] From the great self-complete spontaneous presence,
<tantra> [11763] For the purpose of engaging in definite primordial purity,
<tantra> [11764] As the wisdom of extremes and sides,
<tantra> [11765] This itself self-arisen, self-manifest,
<tantra> [11766] In the appearance free from extremes,
<tantra> [11767] It appears as related to the essence.
<tantra> [11768] Without this, because certainty is not obtained,
<tantra> [11769] Because cause and effect reversal fault would occur,
<tantra> [11770] It appears truly as extreme-free.
<tantra> [11771] The quality arising mode unceasing,
<tantra> [11772] As the source producing cyclic existence,
<tantra> [11773] Like the impure gate of appearance,
<tantra> [11774] It manifests unceasingly as the arising mode.
<tantra> [11775] Without this, because confusion would be nameless,
<tantra> [11776] Therefore, the impure gate of cyclic existence,
<tantra> [11777] As the life-rope of existences,
<tantra> [11778] Appears unceasingly in manner.
<tantra> [11779] Thus is taught the gate of impure cyclic existence.
<tantra> [11780] Because transcendent wisdom exists,
<tantra> [11781] Purity itself indicates purity.



[11782] <tantra> The individual paths of appearance-making display,
[11783] <tantra> In the gate of great pure primordial wisdom,
[11784] <tantra> Appear as the three total-openings.
[11785] <tantra> Without this, because self-potency would be incomplete,
[11786] <tantra> In the gate of great pure primordial wisdom,
[11787] <tantra> For realizing the essence primordially pure, they appear.
[11788] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[11789] Second: dividing the fault and quality portions by conditions.
[11790] Just as camphor, though appearing as a quality for fever illness,
[11791] Appears as a fault for cold illness,
[11792] Yet in camphor's essence, fault and quality are not established—
[11793] Similarly, the arising mode of ground and ground-appearance also appears as a quality to those who know their own face, as the condition of liberation,
[11794] While to those who do not know, because it becomes a partial basis of confusion, though appearing as a fault,
[11795] Ground and its appearance are not established as fault or quality.
[11796] Moreover, from the aspect of the reversal mode of confusion in the ground of spontaneous presence,
[11797] Because beings are primordially enlightened,
[11798] Faults themselves appear as qualities, appearing as unfavorable conditions as aids,
[11799] Primordially, faults are self-liberated in their own purity.
[11800] From the face of spontaneous presence potency-appearance,
[11801] Because it appears as primordial wisdom,
[11802] According to the entering mode of confusion, afflictions confuse as the aspect of faults,
[11803] From the potency of spontaneous presence simultaneously reversing desired confusion,
[11804] Because it appears as self-settling without contrivance, faults become qualities,
[11805] Obstacles become spiritual attainments,
[11806] Obstructing demons and afflictions are not found,
[11807] Without apprehending even qualities, totally open in the joining of the four wisdoms.
[11808] From the aspect of spontaneous presence appearance mode, appearing as non-dual,
[11809] According to the entering mode of confusion, self and other become two,
[11810] According to the reversing mode of confusion, without dividing self and other,
[11811] Without contrivance, settled in self-settling,
[11812] Selfless emptiness established as quality, faults are not found when sought,
[11813] Samsara and nirvana are non-dual—Buddhahood.
[11814] Moreover, from spontaneous presence appearance mode appearing as extreme-free,
[11815] According to the entering mode of cyclic existence, because conceptual collections confuse downward as faults,
[11816] According to the reversing mode of confusion,
[11817] Because the two extremes become the center, extreme confusion self-liberated, confusion appears as primordial wisdom—Buddhahood.
[11818] Moreover, from the quality aspect of spontaneous presence arising in the gate of pure primordial wisdom,



[11819] According to the entering mode of cyclic existence, impure confusion appears,
[11820] According to the reversing mode of confusion, liberated in the complete potency of primordial purity—Buddhahood.
[11821] Moreover, from the aspect of spontaneous presence appearance mode arising in the gate of impure cyclic existence,
[11822] The modes of confusion are two:
[11823] Confusion like this downward, and
[11824] At the end of the bardo, because definite confidence in spontaneous presence jewel does not arise, confusion in the bardo of existence.
[11825] According to the reversing mode of confusion, liberated in uncontrived pure abiding—Buddhahood.
[11826] Moreover, the essence primordially pure, free from elaboration,
[11827] The nature arising as the complete mode of spontaneous presence qualities,
[11828] To those who do not realize the ground, faults arise as spontaneous presence.
[11829] From each of those six actual grounds, though the sharp-facultied are liberated, because existence does not cease, there are seven gates of liberation in those six liberation modes.
[11830] Because confusion arises from above, not knowing the reversing mode of confusion, gradually confused in those six stages,
[11831] Called the impure gate:
[11832] From coarse confusion proceeding,
[11833] Miraculously born and born from light-egg, the body is established.
[11834] The gradual one liberated from the bardo also obtains stability, and with wisdom potency complete, is certain in those seven liberation modes.
[11835] To the dull-facultied in whom realization does not arise and whose familiarity is short,
[11836] Because ground is not seized there, the bardo of existence arises,
[11837] Reaching the appearance of the next.
[11838] Therefore, the basis of confusion and
[11839] The basis of liberation both meet in the gate of spontaneous presence—understand this well.
[11840] Third: establishing the proof of arising and ceasing appearance modes has two parts:
[11841] This life and
[11842] The bardo.
[11843] When diligent individuals practice in this life,
[11844] That ground abiding in the heart, the inner resonance aspect of ground-appearance, light-essence, and outer space appear—the impure gate of cyclic existence appears chiefly at the time of directly manifesting dharmata,
[11845] Light-appearance and
[11846] External earth and stones, internal conceptual collections, etc., appear to the faculties.
[11847] The appearances and experiences of awareness when practicing the gate of primordial wisdom.
[11848] The appearance like light progressively increasing.
[11849] The appearance like body—awareness reaches its measure.
[11850] At the time of dharmata exhaustion, appearing as non-dual and extreme-free.
[11851] The appearance like compassion—all those are the arising of inner wisdom and compassion.
[11852] When those are complete, because outer ground-appearance dissolves into essence, liberated at the original ground.
[11853] In the bardo, first that ground appears as primordially pure appearance,



[11854] The aspect of ground-appearance appears as light-clear,
[11855] From spontaneous presence appearance, body-like appearance arises as a mass.
[11856] Appearing as primordial wisdom and light—the joining of four.
[11857] In spontaneous presence jewel appearance, there are two: pure primordial wisdom and
[11858] Impure gate of cyclic existence.
[11859] If one's own face is known, compassion and
[11860] Non-duality and
[11861] Extreme-free appear,
[11862] Dissolving into potency-ground, liberated.
[11863] Thus, because ground-appearance exists in the ground, during practice and
[11864] In the bardo and
[11865] At the beginning when confusing as sentient beings, whatever occurs, that is the crucial point of the eight modes of appearance arising.
[11866] Buddhas and sentient beings too are only a matter of knowing or not knowing the self-face of appearance,
[11867] Like the palm and back of the hand, the cause of samsara and nirvana is one.
[11868] This present appearance too is only like the eight examples of illusion in the impure gate of appearance,
[11869] Outer and inner objects non-existent, separated from ground, equal, wide open, just this,
[11870] Not needing to be abandoned,
[11871] Not needing to be accepted—when other appearance arises, without trace, great self-reversal,
[11872] Like waking from sleep reverses the dream,
[11873] Reversing to the liberated ground, going to great primordial emptiness—understanding this crucial point well, one goes to universal liberation without effort.
[11874] Third: demonstrating the dissolution mode into the original ground.
[11875] Thus, those great appearances arising from the ground, whether one's own face is known or not,
[11876] Dissolving into crystal light within, or
[11877] Like when later dreams arise, earlier ones cease—passed beyond,
[11878] All appearances gone without anything remaining,
[11879] Is from the original resonance reversing within,
[11880] Not going elsewhere.
[11881] Just as in the state of two dreams, without going elsewhere than dissolving,
[11882] Likewise, when particularly waking, without going elsewhere than the arising dream dissolving within knowing.
[11883] How is the dissolution mode?
[11884] From the Gem Treasury Tantra:



<tantra> [11885] Alas, Vajra of Speech, listen!
<tantra> [11886] All those are fault-quality arising modes,
<tantra> [11887] Qualities of awareness itself, or
<tantra> [11888] Eight dissolution modes as play-potency.
<tantra> [11889] Spontaneous presence, ground without definiteness,
<tantra> [11890] Qualities appear in manner such as this.
<tantra> [11891] Compassion day is to compassion,
<tantra> [11892] Because its own essence self-dissolves,
<tantra> [11893] Through the mode of unobtained self-settling,
<tantra> [11894] It passes into the expanse of non-deed.
<tantra> [11895] Because it does not do anything,



<tantra> [11896] All deeds and conduct are nirvana.
<tantra> [11897] Because undone doing appears not,
<tantra> [11898] All conditioned things are the expanse of purity.
<tantra> [11899] Because it itself self-dissolves into itself,
<tantra> [11900] It does not go elsewhere.
<tantra> [11901] For example, to the heart of the sun,
<tantra> [11902] Just as its own rays self-dissolve,
<tantra> [11903] Through being together with its own resonance,
<tantra> [11904] All dream-appearances are nirvana.
<tantra> [11905] All these are jewel-qualities,
<tantra> [11906] Not abiding in faults—own ground.
<tantra> [11907] Because self-light self-dissolves,
<tantra> [11908] This too appears as great quality.
<tantra> [11909] Because one's own essence completely pure,
<tantra> [11910] The object of attachment grasping marks ceases.
<tantra> [11911] Though outer elements coarse,
<tantra> [11912] Not appearing here, attachment reverses.
<tantra> [11913] From great emptiness of self-pure,
<tantra> [11914] Color self-grasping is nirvana.
<tantra> [11915] This too without going elsewhere.
<tantra> [11916] Because self-dissolving into one's own essence,
<tantra> [11917] All appearances are nirvana.
<tantra> [11918] Because light mandala self-dissolves,
<tantra> [11919] For example, like the sky's rainbow itself,
<tantra> [11920] Just as self-dissolving into the sky itself,
<tantra> [11921] In the expanse of great non-division,
<tantra> [11922] All grasping attachment is nirvana.
<tantra> [11923] This too is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11924] Quality arising mode such as this.
<tantra> [11925] Primordial wisdom to primordial wisdom itself,
<tantra> [11926] Because self-dissolving into one's own essence,
<tantra> [11927] The apprehending thought of knowing,
<tantra> [11928] In the expanse of self-abiding equality,
<tantra> [11929] All are non-dual nirvana.
<tantra> [11930] Individual primordial wisdom appearance aspect too,
<tantra> [11931] In the center of the unmade expanse,
<tantra> [11932] Without setting, nirvana.
<tantra> [11933] Because it itself self-dissolves into itself,
<tantra> [11934] All various plays of primordial wisdom,
<tantra> [11935] Dissolving into one's own face,
<tantra> [11936] Like a child entering the mother's lap,
<tantra> [11937] One's own primordial wisdom self-confident,
<tantra> [11938] One's own nature nirvana.
<tantra> [11939] This too is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11940] Moreover, the mode of quality dissolving:
<tantra> [11941] Because body itself self-dissolves into body,
<tantra> [11942] All forms in great non-thought,
<tantra> [11943] Without appearance, nirvana.
<tantra> [11944] Elements gathered by the coarse,
<tantra> [11945] Non-recognition grasped by the subtle, etc.,
<tantra> [11946] Without doing, nirvana.
<tantra> [11947] Because bodies self-dissolve into their own face,
<tantra> [11948] The arising portion of knowing is not lost outward.
<tantra> [11949] For example, like a vase body's form,
<tantra> [11950] Internal clear, external movements,
<tantra> [11951] In fire-nature ground, pure.



<tantra> [11952] This too is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11953] Moreover, quality such as this:
<tantra> [11954] Because non-dual non-dual self-dissolves,
<tantra> [11955] Attachments grasping as countable,
<tantra> [11956] In singular freedom from elaboration,
<tantra> [11957] In the manner of non-two as one,
<tantra> [11958] In self-dissolving itself, nirvana.
<tantra> [11959] Because dual appearance self-dissolves,
<tantra> [11960] For example, to a river, a river,
<tantra> [11961] Just as dissolving, not dividing difference,
<tantra> [11962] In great non-difference, nirvana.
<tantra> [11963] This too is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11964] Unceasing quality such as this:
<tantra> [11965] Extreme-free itself to extreme-free,
<tantra> [11966] Because self-dissolving into one's own essence,
<tantra> [11967] All self-continua grasping body-speech,
<tantra> [11968] Bodies exhausted, nirvana.
<tantra> [11969] Because extreme itself self-pure self-dissolves,
<tantra> [11970] For example, like sky to sky,
<tantra> [11971] Just as dissolving, without identification,
<tantra> [11972] Four extremes' conceptual grasping self-ceased,
<tantra> [11973] In great non-abiding, nirvana.
<tantra> [11974] This too is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11975] Appearance quality such as this:
<tantra> [11976] The gate of self-entering impure cyclic existence,
<tantra> [11977] To the pure gate of essence itself,
<tantra> [11978] Dissolves in the mode of not going.
<tantra> [11979] For example, like thatch rope strands,
<tantra> [11980] Just as gathered by pliability to the center,
<tantra> [11981] Objects of faculties' engagement nirvana.
<tantra> [11982] This itself is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11983] Thus quality portion complete,
<tantra> [11984] In the gate of pure primordial wisdom itself,
<tantra> [11985] Because self-dissolving into essence,
<tantra> [11986] Body and primordial wisdom nirvana.
<tantra> [11987] For example, like a snow lion,
<tantra> [11988] Obtains fearlessness confidence without reversal.
<tantra> [11989] This too is jewel-quality.
<tantra> [11990] Thus the arising mode of qualities,
<tantra> [11991] Abiding as one, primordial wisdom ground,
<tantra> [11992] Without seeking, self-found by itself,
<tantra> [11993] Primordially that is its nature.
<tantra> [11994] Thus it is spoken.
[11995] This mode is a difficult point of the Secret Heart Essence.
[11996] Though clearly spoken in tantras and oral instructions,
[11997] Previously in Tibet, not even a fraction could explain it,
[11998] Therefore I have clearly differentiated and taught it.
[11999] If this crucial point is known hereafter, know it as the power of these words.
[12000] Second: Samantabhadra's liberation mode has three parts:



[12001] The mode of liberation in the instant of seeing ground-appearance,
[12002] The mode of abiding in the expanse after liberation,
[12003] The mode of benefiting others from that.
[12004] First:
[12005] From the original expanse,
[12006] Inner resonance manifests outward,
[12007] The moment compassion-awareness self-non-recognition aspect arises, that ground-appearance looking outward,
[12008] In the instant of recognizing here that it is one's own appearance,
[12009] Non-recognition self-pure from ground-appearance spontaneous presence arising mode self-dissolves, abiding in its own place in the ground of primordial purity.
[12010] Moreover, because in an instant it differentiates self-appearance,
[12011] In an instant Buddhahood,
[12012] The Teacher who came before as playful—
[12013] From the Thalgyur:



<tantra> [12014] Thus from samsara and nirvana's beginning and end,
<tantra> [12015] Because Buddhahood does not become confusion,
<tantra> [12016] By faculties transcending the ground,
<tantra> [12017] Knowing one's own appearance natureless,
<tantra> [12018] Conceptual mind does not wander outward,
<tantra> [12019] Movement is self-determination.
<tantra> [12020] Thus it is spoken.



[12021] From the Gongpa Khandro Gyud:



<tantra> [12022] At that time Samantabhadra, through six dharmas,
<tantra> [12023] Knowing the ground, having destroyed six non-recognitions,
<tantra> [12024] From mere settling, mind mere empty,
<tantra> [12025] Because mere awareness arises, awareness-diminishment destroyed,
<tantra> [12026] Because clear by clarity, darkness dispelled,
<tantra> [12027] Because arising gently, without coarseness,
<tantra> [12028] Because free from superimpositions, non-recognition pure,
<tantra> [12029] Because changeless, like space.
<tantra> [12030] Moreover, Vajrasattva, listen!
<tantra> [12031] Because confusion, non-recognition reversed and destroyed,
<tantra> [12032] Neutrality self-destroyed empty,
<tantra> [12033] Because inanimate and awareness differentiated, meeting the ground,
<tantra> [12034] Therefore non-recognition darkness dispelled,
<tantra> [12035] Like the sun rising over Mount Meru.
<tantra> [12036] Thus it is spoken.



[12037] From the Self-Arisen Bliss Wheel Tantra:



<tantra> [12038] From mere settling, awareness arises,
<tantra> [12039] Gently clear, free from superimpositions.
<tantra> [12040] Thus it is spoken.



[12041] From the Gyutrul:



<tantra> [12042] In an instant differentiating,
<tantra> [12043] In an instant completely enlightened.
<tantra> [12044] Thus it is spoken.



[12045] Moreover, though Samantabhadra is renowned as enlightened from the original ground without doing even a mote of virtue,
[12046] When analyzed, knowing one's own face is the ocean of uncontrived self-arisen virtue,



[12047] The great collections primordially complete, and
[12048] The non-recognition of neutrality dispelled, obscurations destroyed at the time of primordial,
[12049] Because known as self-appearance, non-recognition dispelled,
[12050] Because that dispelled, all afflictions dispelled,
[12051] Because arising from dispelled non-recognition.
[12052] At that very moment, because the qualities of self-abiding appear, one is enlightened as body and primordial wisdom.
[12053] Saying "liberated from the original ground" is also an exaggeration,
[12054] Because liberated when ground-appearance arises from the ground,
[12055] Liberated in the instant transcending the ground.
[12056] Where is one liberated?
[12057] Saying "liberated at the original ground" is also coarse,
[12058] Liberated in the ground of spontaneous presence complete.
[12059] If liberated at the original ground, one would also reverse,
[12060] Because the ground is posited from the aspect of confusion arising,
[12061] Because it is the ground of samsara and nirvana.
[12062] The liberation place itself is the beginning,
[12063] If asked whether the ground is the beginning,
[12064] It is explained first in the actual state, but
[12065] It is not the first ground.
[12066] In brief, when one's own face is known, the expanse's qualities complete,
[12067] Called liberation as result because separated from obscurations.
[12068] Therefore, the measure of qualities such as body and primordial wisdom abiding at the arising ground is called expanse-quality,
[12069] It exists in awareness,
[12070] Because not manifest.
[12071] At the time of completion, it is called Buddhahood quality,
[12072] Because by the power of dispelling non-recognition, qualities self-existing expand by appearing.
[12073] Moreover, one posits the quality of Buddhahood of the ground of spontaneous presence, and
[12074] The quality of the actualized-result Buddha.
[12075] Thus, Samantabhadra's Buddhahood is
[12076] Six dharmas:
<list> [12077] Transcending the ground,
<list> [12078] Appearance to one's own face,
<list> [12079] Differentiating characteristics,
<list> [12080] Liberated at the time of differentiating,
<list> [12081] Not arising from other,
<list> [12082] Abiding in its own place.
[12083] Those are results not arising from causes,
[12084] Buddhahood not arising from mind,
[12085] Oral instructions not arising from scriptures, self-arisen—Buddhahood.
[12086] Liberation of original ground and ground-appearance as result is



[12087] Done by realized wisdom.
[12088] From the Drönma Barwa Tantra:



<tantra> [12089] Ground itself ripens as result—wisdom,
<tantra> [12090] Because wisdom ripens as body,
<tantra> [12091] That essence Dharma-body itself,
<tantra> [12092] Ripens as primordial wisdom Dharma-body.
<tantra> [12093] By that, primordial wisdom continuous without ceasing,
<tantra> [12094] Body and primordial wisdom spontaneously present, clear.
<tantra> [12095] Thus it is spoken.



[12096] At that time, the aspect of knowables appearing as objects appearing, knowing in one's own face, is the all-knowing Buddha.
[12097] Abiding as one's own face inner-clear, from the state of dharmata,
[12098] The pacification of elaborating conceptualizer is the all-knowing Buddha.
[12099] Moreover, though knowing all, because not moving from one's own face dharmata,
[12100] Inner-abiding knowing and
[12101] Outer-looking knowing aspect,
[12102] By the distinction of aspect appearing or not,
[12103] All-knowing primordial wisdom and
[12104] Aspect-all-knowing primordial wisdom and
[12105] Called aspect-all-knowing primordial wisdom.
[12106] Those two, because essence one though reversal different, all-knowing in inner-abiding.



[12107] Second: the mode of abiding in the expanse after liberation is:
[12108] Because the qualities of primordially pure spontaneous presence appear, like crystal light gathered within,
[12109] One's own face inner-clear abides as the youth vase body,
[12110] Within the expanse of the Dharma-body primordially pure essence, without center or extreme, a vast height expanse,
[12111] Within the arrangement of spontaneous presence depth-clear five lights palace,
[12112] Awareness's empty portion Samantabhadri, appearance portion Dharma-body Samantabhadra's consort, self-clear,
[12113] Self-related by the net of method and wisdom,
[12114] Wisdom becoming the life-horse, all knowables established as knowers, swift,
[12115] Five lights' inner resonance unmixed, equal nature wide plain,
[12116] That itself without setting, secret sun shines in the expanse.
[12117] At that time, the expanse's five elements self-arranged appear and resonate as light.



[12118] The depth-clear resonance does not cease,
[12119] Primordial wisdom's five lights coil like a garland in the expanse,
[12120] Empty because not established as thing and mark,
[12121] Not gone to nothingness cut-off, well-tempered,
[12122] Essence, nature, compassion three knotted as one,
[12123] Awareness having house of light,
[12124] Appearance without end of light spontaneous thick,
[12125] Liberated primordial wisdom infinite, victory banner peak with ten powers and
[12126] Four fearlessnesses and
[12127] Individual knowing and
[12128] Marks and
[12129] Minor marks, etc., nature never setting,
[12130] Clear as lamp of infinite light rays,
[12131] Self-appearance of primordial wisdom without increase or decrease,
[12132] The path wished to benefit by great compassion, not traveling elsewhere, self-purpose clear,
[12133] With five bodies' stupa and five primordial wisdoms' steps,
[12134] Not moving from dharmata's expanse seat,
[12135] Great compassion's empty path skilled in methods reaching to the ends of directions pervading everywhere,
[12136] Abiding foremost before all as the Teacher of all Buddhas and sentient beings.



[12137] Moreover, from the Self-Arisen:



<tantra> [12138] Hey, supreme being, lion of speech, you listen!
<tantra> [12139] The jewel-variegated heap is of great height.
<tantra> [12140] The jewel palace is well-arranged.
<tantra> [12141] The jewel-variegated consort is beautifully ornamented.
<tantra> [12142] The jewel-variegated net is even.
<tantra> [12143] The beautiful jewel horse is swift.
<tantra> [12144] On the jewel-various steps, without exhaustion.
<tantra> [12145] The jewel-five plain is all even.
<tantra> [12146] The jewel secret sun has no rising or setting.
<tantra> [12147] The jewel water lotus is without stain.
<tantra> [12148] The jewel fire mandala is well-stacked.
<tantra> [12149] The jewel wind wisdom has no thought.
<tantra> [12150] The jewel earth mandala is the great vehicle.
<tantra> [12151] The jewel sky is without center or extreme.
<tantra> [12152] The jewel blazing light has no rising or setting.
<tantra> [12153] The jewel ray garland is well-rooted.



<tantra> [12154] The jewel empty mandala is well-drawn.
<tantra> [12155] The jewel extreme three knots are well-twisted.
<tantra> [12156] The jewel depth darkness-dispelling vast and spontaneous thick.
<tantra> [12157] The jewel victory banner peak does not set.
<tantra> [12158] The jewel lamp blazing is light-clear.
<tantra> [12159] The jewel secret primordial wisdom has no increase or decrease.
<tantra> [12160] The jewel interrelated path is untraversable.
<tantra> [12161] The jewel body-relic blazing stupa is well-stacked.
<tantra> [12162] On the jewel vajra seat, without change.
<tantra> [12163] The jewel empty path has no end.
<tantra> [12164] Thus is shown the self-abiding mind instruction.
<tantra> [12165] Thus it is spoken.



[12166] These accord with the Secret Sphere Thigle:
[12167] Earth jewel five stupa how well-stacked, etc.



[12168] Third: benefiting others from that:
[12169] Without moving from the great primordially pure expanse, the Dharma-body's field,
[12170] From the gate of spontaneous presence, benefiting according to sentient beings' appearance mode,
[12171] From spontaneous presence's light and body potency, arranging the enjoyment body's appearance,
[12172] From that, arranging the great Brahma's aeon,
[12173] The nature emanation body's appearance and
[12174] The impure cyclic existence gate, pervading sentient beings' realms as Teacher, demonstrating cyclic existence as empty.



[12175] These appear in the common vehicle too.
[12176] From the Uttaratantra:



<tantra> [12177] Unconditioned and spontaneously accomplished,
<tantra> [12178] Not realized by other's conditions,
<tantra> [12179] Endowed with knowledge, love, and power,
<tantra> [12180] The Buddha possessing two purposes,
<tantra> [12181] Because it is the nature of beginning, middle, and end without,
<tantra> [12182] Unconditioned because of peaceful Dharma-body,
<tantra> [12183] Called spontaneously accomplished,
<tantra> [12184] Because self-realized individually,
<tantra> [12185] Not realized by other's conditions,
<tantra> [12186] Thus threefold, because of realization, knows,
<tantra> [12187] Because showing the path, loves the mind,
<tantra> [12188] By power, primordial wisdom, compassion,
<tantra> [12189] For the sake of dispelling suffering and afflictions.
<tantra> [12190] First three are self-purpose,
<tantra> [12191] Later three are other-purpose.
<tantra> [12192] Thus it is spoken.



[12193] In its commentary:
[12194] Thus, the extremely amazing and inconceivable object, Buddhahood,
[12195] Without hearing from other, without teacher, self-arisen primordial wisdom's inexpressible nature completely enlightened,
[12196] After that, for the sake of others who became blind without realization also to realize,
[12197] For the sake of demonstrating the path to realize that,
[12198] Should be known as endowed with unsurpassed primordial wisdom and
[12199] Compassion.
[12200] Thus it is spoken.
[12201] Such a Teacher, having attained enlightenment before all,
[12202] Benefits the Buddhas of the three times and
[12203] All sentient beings of the three realms,
[12204] Abiding without beginning or end, is called Teacher Samantabhadra of complete dominion.
[12205] Fields and deeds are as much as the appearances of sentient beings and Buddhas pervade the dharmadhatu and sky's reaches.



[12206] Third: the mode of sentient beings' non-recognition confusion is:
[12207] Though there is no confusion in the original ground,
[12208] When ground-appearance arises, the non-recognition of one's own face, the neutral awareness-rooted knowing, divides ground-appearance into types, confusing as sentient beings.
[12209] From the Mu-tig Phreng-ba:



<tantra> [12210] From the greatly different appearance,
<tantra> [12211] Existence and non-existence two arise,
<tantra> [12212] Called common ground of confusion,
<tantra> [12213] Because non-recognition itself is infused,
<tantra> [12214] Knowables themselves appear as stains.
<tantra> [12215] Thus it is spoken.



[12216] To the Dharma-body like space,
[12217] Adventitious sentient beings obscure like clouds,
[12218] The unconfused dharmata also
[12219] Appears in the mode of confusion to the mind.
[12220] With cause and conditions, momentary.
[12221] Thus it is spoken.



[12222] From the Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra:



<tantra> [12223] All these sentient beings of the three realms,
<tantra> [12224] From the ground which is nothing, confuse as anything.
<tantra> [12225] That ground essence empty,
<tantra> [12226] Nature clearly,



[12227] Compassion appears able to sentient beings.
[12228] From that, the apprehending knowing, non-recognition aspect, a mere stirring arises,
[12229] From knowing darkness, does father arise from me,
[12230] Or do I arise from father—the knowing that arises merely by this confuses.
[12231] Non-recognition does not exist in the ground, it exists in taste or aspect.
[12232] From aspect, four conditions arise.
[12233] Moreover, the ground-light abiding as a house, called causal condition,
[12234] Non-recognition itself.
[12235] Proceeding to investigate that, called dominant condition.
[12236] Grasping as object-possessor, called observed condition,
[12237] For example, like showing a man's form in a mirror.
[12238] Those three simultaneous, called immediate condition.
[12239] Though that is one's own ground, not knowing one's own face, confusing, the three realms' cyclic existence is established.
[12240] From that, afflictions proceed coarsely, sentient beings' forms arise as different.
[12241] Thus it is spoken: From such ground, one confuses.



[12242] Moreover, when investigating knowing arises to ground-appearance,
[12243] From the aspect of non-recognition not knowing its own face, cause self-same,
[12244] Because the four conditions' observed impure, one confuses.
[12245] These modes from the Palgyi Trashi:
[12246] Moreover, confused by conditional ground,
[12247] Finally also meets the four conditions.
[12248] From the cause grasping observed-possessor condition,
[12249] Confuse as the cause of various results.
[12250] From dominant condition grasping object-possessor, confuse as various names.
[12251] From observed condition grasping mind-possessor, confuse as reaching without result.
[12252] From immediate condition grasping-possessor, confuse as various appearances.
[12253] This is the great confusion mode of Secret Mantra ground.
[12254] Moreover, the appearing mode with that non-recognition condition appears together with mere self.
[12255] Moreover, that non-recognition together with five root afflictions, gathering many conceptual collections.
[12256] With many thousands of conditions,



[12257] With many appearance modes,
[12258] Vast by appearance mode.
[12259] Moreover, from spontaneous presence jewel casket actual state appearance unceasing,
[12260] Ground not changing, appearance changes,
[12261] Following after various objects,
[12262] All realize.
[12263] Though Dharma-body appearance does not change,
[12264] Confused appearance appears as if changing.
[12265] Though Vajrasattva does not possess confusion,
[12266] Demonstrates the mode of confusion to sentient beings.
[12267] Finally, reversing one's own appearance to one's own conditional ground.
[12268] Not knowing non-dual appearance self-arisen,
[12269] Grasping confusion as dominant, dominant condition.
[12270] Not knowing self-awareness's result self-arisen,
[12271] Grasping cause as dependent, causal condition.
[12272] Not knowing object and knowing as empty,
[12273] Grasping observed as object, observed condition of self-face.
[12274] Not knowing light self-arisen from time,
[12275] Knowing arises grasping that as that,
[12276] Similar, immediate condition, thus it is spoken.
[12277] Moreover, the first three non-recognitions of confusion are:
[12278] From the aspect of merely not recognizing one's own face,
[12279] Because grasping and fixating do not arise, though called "not confused by meaning," that proceeds to confusion,
[12280] Like nameless becoming named, that is the non-recognition of cause self-same.
[12281] That itself not known, co-emergent, the aspect of samsara and nirvana's appearance arises.
[12282] Thus, from the aspect of dividing the mind into dual appearances toward light-appearance objects, grasping name and meaning as self proceeds to the conceived non-recognition.
[12283] Such cause has four conditions:
[12284] The causal condition gathered by three such non-recognitions,
[12285] Like a man with form and limbs, marks arising as self-characteristics.
[12286] From that, the observed condition like a mirror appears to external objects,
[12287] Because face exists there, like appearing in the mirror.



[12288] From light-appearance self-face outward manifest,
[12289] Dominant condition mirror and
[12290] Face and
[12291] Grasping self in reality, like thought of face and mirror,
[12292] Light and
[12293] Awareness and
[12294] Dharmata three, with thought, called dominant condition.
[12295] Thus, cause non-recognition three, conditions three simultaneous,
[12296] Similar immediate condition,
[12297] Confusion actually arises.
[12298] Those four conditions, at the time of individuals,
[12299] Cause Buddha and sentient beings one, known as primordial wisdom transcending acceptance and rejection,
[12300] Causal condition self-liberated in its own place.
[12301] Objects appearing variously, liberated as dharmata's self-appearance,
[12302] Observed condition objects different self-liberated.
[12303] Moreover, because self-arisen primordial wisdom appears and liberates,
[12304] Dominant condition self-liberated.
[12305] Because time without certainty contradicts earlier and later times,
[12306] Similar immediate condition self-liberated.
[12307] Thus, cause and conditions both made confusion's nature,
[12308] Those two's ripening body makes accumulated different arises,
[12309] Mind makes cause, perceptions objects different,
[12310] Objects mind different confusion,
[12311] Body and mind included, that too confuses in the first instant.
[12312] This itself is the beginning of cyclic existence.
[12313] From the Thalgyur:



<tantra> [12314] The beginning of all cyclic existence is
<tantra> [12315] From indivisible unmade nature,
<tantra> [12316] Observed-grasping object arises,
<tantra> [12317] From thought-grasping, different appears.
<tantra> [12318] Observed-grasping related as twelve,
<tantra> [12319] Is the beginning of cyclic existence itself.
<tantra> [12320] Three non-recognitions' confusion mode,
<tantra> [12321] Connected, indivisible root,
<tantra> [12322] Not knowing as one's own face,
<tantra> [12323] This too is the beginning of cyclic existence.
<tantra> [12324] Thus it is spoken.



[12325] At that time, the manner of twelve dependent links arising is:
[12326] Compassion's potency, not knowing one's own face, three non-recognitions arise—non-recognition.
[12327] The four conditions are the maker of cyclic existence.
[12328] From that, knowing coarse, engaging object aspect, consciousness.
[12329] From that, different karma's body and name arise—name and form.
[12330] From that distinction, color and element individual portion established—the six sense bases.



[12331] From that, enjoying objects is contact.
[12332] From that, joy, sorrow, and neutral arise—feeling.
[12333] From that, knowing attached to pleasure, not wanting suffering is craving.
[12334] From that, accepting objects is grasping.
[12335] From that, karma and afflictions expand, projecting to next birth—existence.
[12336] From that, different realms birth is birth.
[12337] From that, declining, aging, and death is aging and death.
[12338] That too is confusion by twelve dependent links from me at first.
[12339] Even in one life, light-clear sets, first instant of existence bardo appearance of not knowing one's own face is non-recognition,
[12340] External breath ceases at death.
[12341] Between that, dependent links proceed.
[12342] Then, the dissolution mode of subtle and coarse, pulse-send stages reversed,
[12343] Confused appearance empty, reversing to cyclic existence,
[12344] Nirvana self-arisen actual state from first primordially pure appearance arising,
[12345] Dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana's dependent links manifest.
[12346] There, not knowing one's own face also confuses,
[12347] Knowing liberates, called liberation from cyclic existence to nirvana.
[12348] Moreover, ground and ground-appearance,
[12349] Both without non-recognition,
[12350] Like clouds adventitiously arise as conditions,
[12351] Made cause by impure cyclic existence gate,
[12352] Three realms, six classes, individually confuse.
[12353] From the Mu-tig Phreng-ba:



<tantra> [12354] Thus to the abiding dharmata,
<tantra> [12355] Confusion does not exist from the first,
<tantra> [12356] To the Dharma-body like space,
<tantra> [12357] Adventitious sentient beings obscure like clouds.
<tantra> [12358] Thus it is spoken.



[12359] From that great ground-appearance,
[12360] Because non-recognition is not imputed,
[12361] Established confusion does not exist.
[12362] Thus it is spoken.
[12363] Adventitiously, by forceful imputation, impure cyclic existence dharmas arise.
[12364] From that:



<tantra> [12365] Thus these three worlds,
<tantra> [12366] Five aggregates and five faculties,
<tantra> [12367] Five limbs and five essences,
<tantra> [12368] Five objects and five afflictions,
<tantra> [12369] Five minds, five mental cognitions, five thoughts,
<tantra> [12370] Grasping and fixation establish cyclic existence itself.
<tantra> [12371] Thus it is spoken.



<tantra> [12372] Earth, water, fire, wind, and space,
<tantra> [12373] Great elements arise from that.
<tantra> [12374] Gods, anti-gods, humans,
<tantra> [12375] Hell beings, animals, hungry ghosts,
<tantra> [12376] Great ones truly arise from that.
<tantra> [12377] Desire, hatred, delusion,
<tantra> [12378] Pride, jealousy, etc.,
<tantra> [12379] Miracles arise from that itself.
<tantra> [12380] Non-recognition, sentient beings' minds,
<tantra> [12381] Aggregates, elements, sense bases,
<tantra> [12382] Consciousness collections,
<tantra> [12383] Faculties five, etc., arise.
<tantra> [12384] Sound, smell, taste,
<tantra> [12385] Touch itself and objects,
<tantra> [12386] Arise from that itself as continuity.
<tantra> [12387] Husk and corpse,
<tantra> [12388] Without essence, etc.,
<tantra> [12389] Arise from that potency and play.
<tantra> [12390] All-base and appropriation,
<tantra> [12391] Flesh, blood, lymph,
<tantra> [12392] Bones, skin, hair,
<tantra> [12393] Accumulated bodies arise from that.
<tantra> [12394] Thus it is spoken.



[12395] At that time, six non-recognitions also arise self-characteristically.
[12396] From the Self-Arisen:



[12397] Non-recognition is thus:
[12398] Root mind non-recognition and
[12399] Confusion object non-recognition and
[12400] Confusion basis ground non-recognition and
[12401] Grasping thought non-recognition and
[12402] Contrived path non-recognition and
[12403] Unknown delusion non-recognition—
[12404] Thus non-recognition arises as six types,
[12405] Not seeing one's own appearance.
[12406] Moreover, these are:
[12407] Root mind non-recognition is co-emergent actual,
[12408] Not knowing awareness's primordial wisdom, confusing,
[12409] Does primordial wisdom appearance arise to me,
[12410] Is this not my appearance—the knowing that arises,
[12411] Pride that arises is co-emergent root non-recognition,
[12412] Thought grasping self arises, confuses.
[12413] Then awareness primordial wisdom appearance is obscured.
[12414] That is called root mind non-recognition.
[12415] Now confusion object non-recognition is shown:
[12416] Confusion—by what does one confuse?
[12417] Object—when the previous world not yet formed,



[12418] Wish-fulfilling tree expanding called,
[12419] From Buddha youth vase body blessing arose tree,
[12420] From egg-born warmth and moisture conceived one exists,
[12421] From that, self-arisen primordial wisdom mind stirred, Abhirati world formed.
[12422] That is called confusion object non-recognition.
[12423] Confusion basis ground non-recognition is:
[12424] Confusion basis self not self-pure arises,
[12425] First causal condition called, actual non-recognition arises,
[12426] Ground not known, non-recognition.
[12427] From that, observed condition called, like confusion object non-recognition.
[12428] From that, dominant condition called, pride arises in tree.
[12429] From that, similar immediate condition called,
[12430] Knowing proceeds coarse, grasping by fixation.
[12431] From that, afflictions proceed coarse.
[12432] That is called confusion basis non-recognition.
[12433] Grasping thought non-recognition is:
[12434] From that, affliction collections immeasurable arise.
[12435] Moreover, these are:
[12436] Six grasping minds arise.
[12437] Mind similar to non-recognition and
[12438] Mental consciousness mind and
[12439] All-searching mind and
[12440] Determining mind and
[12441] Coarse-aspect mind and
[12442] Definitely establishing mind.
[12443] Moreover, these are:
[12444] Mind endowed similar to non-recognition is thus:
[12445] Root non-recognition actual,
[12446] Together with mental movement.
[12447] That is mind endowed similar to non-recognition.
[12448] Mental consciousness is grasped by knowing object is mine,
[12449] Because grasping me and self, gone under affliction power, called mental consciousness.
[12450] By determining mind,
[12451] Grasped by knowing object is my object, because attachment arises to that, called determining.
[12452] All-searching mind, gone under object power, gathers all subtle afflictions like a moon.
[12453] Therefore called all-searching mind.
[12454] Coarse-aspect mind is coarse afflictions killing life,



[12455] Doing many samaya-breaking deeds.
[12456] Definitely establishing mind is
[12457] Of those appearances, mine and
[12458] Others'—that is definitely establishing mind.
[12459] That is called grasping thought non-recognition.
[12460] Contrived path non-recognition is:
[12461] Six minds gathered, obscuring primordial wisdom path,
[12462] Mind not seeing primordial wisdom, not allowing clarity,
[12463] No thought of primordial wisdom,
[12464] Because mind has movement,
[12465] Obscures Buddha's path.
[12466] That is called contrived path non-recognition.
[12467] Unknown delusion non-recognition is not knowing existing in one's own appearance light, again and again circling, thus circling in cyclic existence.
[12468] That is unknown delusion non-recognition.
[12469] Thus six non-recognitions arise, not knowing primordial wisdom appearance, thus it is spoken.



[12470] Those are sentient beings' confusion modes,
[12471] From original spontaneous presence self-arisen,
[12472] From awareness not knowing its own face,
[12473] Finally, when confusion ceases, completely pure lineage beyond stains—
[12474] That is the beginning and end of cyclic existence, not the end of Buddhahood.



[12474] From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasure,
[12475] Chapter Nine: Showing the Branching of Samsara and Nirvana from the Gate of Spontaneous Presence Appearance Mode, the Ninth Chapter.



[12476] Thus, having shown liberation and confusion stages from expanse-appearance,
[12477] Now extensively showing from the door of symbols the stages of confusion mode and reversal of confusion, from eight...
