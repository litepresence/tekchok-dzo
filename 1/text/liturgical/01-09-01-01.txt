[11335] From the Rangshar:
<tantra> [11336] That all essence, the primordially pure actual state, is called.
<tantra> [11337] India also—uncut, directionless, not falling anywhere.
<tantra> [11338] Below that, the spontaneous presence jewel casket exists, and
<tantra> [11339] Within that, the arising manner has six forms.
<tantra> [11340] The gate has two forms.
<tantra> [11341] That base is called spontaneous presence.
<tantra> [11342] The base not certain is called.
<tantra> [11343] The base various arising is also called.
<tantra> [11344] Below that, the reverse ground exists.
<tantra> [11345] Below that, the base appearance great exists.
<tantra> [11346] Below that, the enjoyment body appearance exists—thus it was spoken.
[11347] Here, if that meaning is elaborately explained:
[11348] Beginning with the expanse, the youth vase body inside essence abides as body.
[11349] Nature abides as speech.
[11350] Compassion abides as mind.
[11351] That also, possessing life-wind limbs four, the essence awareness of the five wisdom winds abides, resonating and appearing outside.
[11352] The youth vase body, limitless and inseparable from spontaneous presence resonance, from the light of the five appearances, flames each arise and together.
[11353] Compassion, awareness resonance form, investigates and knowledge arises—that also.
[11354] Self-face not knowing, just part from awareness depending, is called ignorance and abides.
[11355] That word, base not changing, although the base appears arising, change change similar becomes is.
[11356] Awareness appearance changing is called.
[11357] At that time, the primordially pure appearance, like sky without clouds, from a state like not existing,
[11358] The spontaneous presence arising manner eight self-appearances arise.
[11359] The jewel casket actual state is the great appearance.
[11360] Compassion, like arising understanding not ceasing, sentient being compassion arises.
[11361] Light, like arising understanding not ceasing, the five wisdoms self-light rainbow-like appearance pervades.
[11362] Wisdom, like arising understanding not ceasing, not-thinking state abides.
[11363] Body, like arising understanding not ceasing, peaceful-wrathful light-clear body pervades the sky.
[11364] Two not existing, like arising understanding not ceasing, one and many not investigated.



[11365] Extreme-free, like appearing's door not ceased, spontaneous self-face-in clear.
[11366] Pure primordial wisdom's door, like appearing's door not ceased, entity primordially pure's appearance, sky cloud not-like appearance above sees.
[11367] Impure samsara's door, like appearing's door not ceased, below the six classes' appearance-portion appears.
[11368] Samsara lower realms play-to primordially arise.
[11369] In the said manner.
[11370] Thus from spontaneous appearance's capacity, in the five primordial wisdoms' field, the enjoyment body's appearance measure not, also directly self-clear.
[11371] From quality's capacity, from direction-corner in nature emanation body's field, appearance also inferred-to, not self-arisen.
[11372] From compassion's capacity, from below to sentient being appearance also measure not, self-to appear.
[11373] Thus this-like ground-appearance clear-to, directly appearing like mirror-to form-reflection arisen.
[11374] Self-to appear, other-to not-appear, self-appearance-to not-know, like dream's appearance.
[11375] Flickering confused scattered arise.
[11376] Self-side not-grasped moment instant.
[11377] That also below primordially pure's spontaneous appearance.
[11378] Below that-of, to the light-clear five's thig-le and ray-radiance appearance, ground early great exists.
[11379] Below that-of, the enjoyment body's appearance.
[11380] Below that-of, the nature emanation body's appearance exists.
[11381] Below that-of, the six modes' appearance and.
[11382] Below that, tame beings-tame emanation body muni six and.
[11383] Impure emanation body birth aging death tame-by-means-of field appearance exists.
[11384] That spontaneous arising-way eight that arise's ground.

<tantra> [11390] From nature not-cease arise,
<tantra> [11391] From compassion-by-means-of not-determinate from non-awareness self-arise.



[11392] For example, like clouds in the sky truly existing not, clouds adventitiously arise.
[11393] Base path awareness exist truly not.
[11394] Compassion, like arising cause non-recognition arises.
[11395] Base spontaneous-accomplishment-of state called attach.
[11396] That also not-determined appearance great one-as dwells.

[11406] Pure primordial wisdom-of gate thorough reach.
[11407] Impure like arise-of compassion not ceases.
[11408] Desire-objects-of jewel jewel like.
[11409] That-like my form-to attach.
[11410] Called the inner youth vase form extent open.

[11420] Then spontaneous-accomplishment-of state great attaches.
[11421] That primordial wisdom-of door not ceases cause complete, enjoyment appearance way attaches.
[11422] Quality-of door not ceases cause, nature emanation form appearance way exists.
[11423] That compassion door not ceases cause, impure appearance way happens thus.
[11424] That-like appearance limit not thought not reach-of dharma great.

[11668] First is.
[11669] First base-to spontaneous not-establish-if.
[11670] Base-appearance manifest-do meaning not-exist-in.
[11671] Base-appearance spontaneous-presence emergence-mode not-exist-if.
[11672] Cyclic-existence transcendence arise-do meaning not-exist-therefore.
[11673] Base and base-appearance-to inner space subtle and.
