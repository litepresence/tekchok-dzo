[11335] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[11336] <tantra> "These are the nature of primordial purity," it is said,
[11337] <tantra> Not falling into any direction of India or Tibet.
[11338] <tantra> Thereafter exists the Precious Jewel Casket of Spontaneous Presence,
[11339] <tantra> In which there are eight modes of appearance.
[11340] <tantra> There are two gates.
[11341] <tantra> This is called the Ground of Spontaneous Presence.
[11342] <tantra> It is called the Ground of Indeterminacy.
[11343] <tantra> It is also called the Ground Appearing as Diversity.
[11344] <tantra> Below this lies the point of reversal.
[11345] <tantra> Thereafter exists the Great Ground-Appearance.
[11346] <tantra> Thereafter exists the Sambhogakaya appearance, it is taught.
[11347] Therefore, when explaining these meanings here in detail,
[11348] The essence abiding as form within the youthful vase body of the primordial expanse,
[11349] The nature abiding as speech,
[11350] The compassion abiding as mind.
[11351] Moreover, from the outward projection of the tones of rigpa abiding as the quintessence in the five wisdom winds with the four limbs of the life-wind,
[11352] From the tones of spontaneous presence in the expanding expanse of the youthful vase body, the appearances of five lights arise as fiery sparks.
[11353] At the same time, the investigating consciousness arises toward the tones of rigpa-compassion,
[11354] From the mere aspect of not knowing its own face, it abides as non-recognition dependent upon rigpa.
[11355] Although the ground itself does not change, because of the appearance of ground-appearance arising, it seems as though it changes.
[11356] This is called the change of appearance in rigpa.
[11357] At that time, from the state of primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,
[11358] The eight modes of spontaneous presence arise as self-appearance.
[11359] The great manner of appearance of the precious casket jewel is:
[11360] The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed gives rise to compassion for sentient beings.
[11361] The gate of light appearing unobstructed fills appearances with the self-light of the five wisdoms, like a rainbow.
[11362] The gate of wisdom appearing unobstructed abides in the state of non-conceptuality.
[11363] The gate of form appearing unobstructed fills space with the clear light bodies of peaceful and wrathful deities.
[11364] The gate of non-duality appearing unobstructed does not conceive of singular or plural.
[11365] The gate of beyond-extremes appearing unobstructed makes spontaneous presence naturally clear in its own state.
[11366] The gate of pure wisdom appearing unobstructed reveals appearances above like a cloudless sky, the primordially pure appearance.
[11367] The gate of impure samsara appearing unobstructed reveals the appearances of the six realms below.
[11368] Thus samsara and the lower realms manifest in spontaneous presence.
[11369] This is the manner of it.
[11370] In this way, from the power of spontaneous presence appearance, within the five wisdom fields, Sambhogakaya appearances are directly self-clear.
[11371] From the power of qualities in the directions, Natural Nirmanakaya fields appear self-arisen, immeasurable.
[11372] From the power of compassion below, sentient beings appear immeasurably, self-appearing.
[11373] Such ground-appearance clarity, though manifestly appearing, is like reflections in a mirror.
[11374] Appearing to oneself, not appearing to others, not recognized as self-appearance, like dream appearances,
[11375] Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant,
[11376] Not grasping its own face, but for a single moment.
[11377] This too is the spontaneous presence appearance within primordial purity.
[11378] Thereafter exists the great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays.
[11379] Thereafter exists the Sambhogakaya appearance.
[11380] Thereafter exists the Natural Nirmanakaya appearance.
[11381] Thereafter exists the appearance of the six realms.
[11382] The six Subduers, Nirmanakayas subduing beings,
[11383] And the impure Nirmanakaya fields that tame through birth, aging, sickness, and death.
[11384] These eight modes of spontaneous presence are the source from which all these arise.
[11385] Like a container for roasting barley.
[11386] Therefore this is called the casket.
[11387] These also, from the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra:
[11388] <tantra> "Alas, though there is no error, from my power error arises,
[11389] <tantra> From the unchanging ground,
[11390] <tantra> Appearing without ceasing in its nature,
[11391] <tantra> From compassion's indeterminacy, non-recognition self-arises.
[11392] <tantra> For example, just as clouds do not truly exist in the sky but arise adventitiously,
[11393] <tantra> So ground, path, and rigpa do not exist as such,
[11394] <tantra> Yet from appearing like compassion, non-recognition arises.
[11395] <tantra> The nature of spontaneous presence is established."
[11396] This too abides as great indeterminate appearance.
[11397] This possesses eight modes of appearance.
[11398] It is called the Precious Jewel Casket nature.
[11399] The gate of sense pleasures unobstructed.
[11400] Abiding as the great unestablished establishment.
[11401] The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed.
[11402] The enjoyment of wisdom appearing unobstructed.
[11403] The essence appearing unobstructed as form.
[11404] The view indeterminate, appearing as non-dual.
[11405] The method unobstructed, appearing as beyond-extremes.
[11406] The pure wisdom gate fully passed through.
[11407] The compassion unobstructed, appearing as impure.
[11408] Like a wish-fulfilling jewel,
[11409] Such abides in my body.
[11410] The inner youthful vase body, wide and expansive,
[11411] The outer abides as the nature of spontaneous presence.
[11412] At that time, my appearance expands outward,
[11413] Undefined and indefinite,
[11414] Fragmented and scattered,
[11415] Unmeasured and untamed,
[11416] Unwavering and undistracted,
[11417] Moving,
[11418] Shifting,
[11419] Arising diversely.
[11420] Thereafter the great nature of spontaneous presence is established.
[11421] From the unobstructed gate of wisdom, the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance is established.
[11422] From the unobstructed gate of qualities, the manner of Natural Nirmanakaya appearance exists.
[11423] From that unobstructed compassion, the impure manner of appearance arises.
[11424] Such appearance is the great dharma beyond measure and conception.
[11425] All lights and forms are magnificently arrayed in spontaneous presence.
[11426] The broad gate of samsara and nirvana arising.
[11427] The great casket that encompasses all.
[11428] From the Garland of Pearls:
[11429] <tantra> "Radiance manifestly appears, majestically great,
[11430] <tantra> Appearance itself is spontaneously beautiful,
[11431] <tantra> The Dharmakaya is introduced and delighted,
[11432] <tantra> The essence is pristine, the casket vast,
[11433] <tantra> The nature all-pervasive, magnificently expansive,
[11434] <tantra> The compassion all-arising, magnificently productive,
[11435] <tantra> The pervasion is the original tone, splendidly clear,
[11436] <tantra> The abiding is unobstructed, swiftly flowing,
[11437] <tantra> The self-snow of rigpa, luminously clear,
[11438] <tantra> The emptiness all-arising, face wondrous,
[11439] <tantra> Unsought, self-settled, continuously enduring,
[11440] <tantra> Unobstructed, self-arising, magnificently established,
[11441] <tantra> The appearances of samsara and existence, foundation towering,
[11442] <tantra> Effortless self-liberation, greatly expansive,
[11443] <tantra> Great primordial realization, skillfully circling,
[11444] <tantra> Possessing five colors, beautifully inscribed,
[11445] <tantra> Samsara and existence utterly pure, perfectly even,
[11446] <tantra> Self-arisen clear light, beautifully arrayed,
[11447] <tantra> The great ground-appearance, greatly encompassing,
[11448] <tantra> The two, samsara and nirvana, skillfully related,
[11449] <tantra> The five bodies and five wisdoms, beautifully stacked."
[11450] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11451] From such appearance,
[11452] When the eight modes of spontaneous presence are explained in detail,
[11453] From the Precious Heap Tantra:
[11454] <tantra> "Alas, Teacher Samantabhadra,
[11455] <tantra> What is the manner of the ground appearing?
[11456] <tantra> How many gates of qualities appear?
[11457] <tantra> From emptiness, how do
[11458] <tantra> Qualities appear complete? Please teach me."
[11459] <tantra> Then he spoke thus:
[11460] <tantra> "From the miracle of non-arising,
[11461] <tantra> In the activity of the Buddhas,
[11462] <tantra> From the beginning, without discerning,
[11463] <tantra> Without ceasing, without termination,
[11464] <tantra> Appearance itself is primordially pure,
[11465] <tantra> Abiding in its own face.
[11466] <tantra> From the great unceasing compassion,
[11467] <tantra> Spontaneous presence, indeterminate,
[11468] <tantra> Arises in the manner of eight appearances.
[11469] <tantra> Through the unobstructed manner of appearance,
[11470] <tantra> From the manner of appearance like compassion,
[11471] <tantra> The source of protection for all sentient beings.
[11472] <tantra> From self-clear unobstructed appearance,
[11473] <tantra> Appears in the manner of the five lights' arising.
[11474] <tantra> Through the unobstructed appearance of knowledge,
[11475] <tantra> Into the gate of pure wisdom,
[11476] <tantra> Appearance arises unobstructed, like the path.
[11477] <tantra> Since all bodies are complete in self-appearance,
[11478] <tantra> They appear as the body of all dharmas.
[11479] <tantra> Since the essence is one,
[11480] <tantra> It also appears as non-dual.
[11481] <tantra> Since it does not abide in its own place,
[11482] <tantra> In the great appearance beyond-extremes,
[11483] <tantra> The indeterminate spontaneous presence appears in the ground.
[11484] <tantra> Since rigpa is spontaneously complete in one,
[11485] <tantra> Into the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11486] <tantra> Related to the essence itself.
[11487] <tantra> Since the manner of arising is unobstructed,
[11488] <tantra> As the source of arising for all sentient beings,
[11489] <tantra> Like the gate of impure appearance,
[11490] <tantra> Arising from the aspect of pervading appearance,
[11491] <tantra> All this appears as the eight appearances.
[11492] <tantra> Since it self-arises in the manner of arising,
[11493] <tantra> It is called the appearance of spontaneous presence.
[11494] <tantra> Appearing in the manner of the precious jewel.
[11495] <tantra> Thus from the great empty-clear,
[11496] <tantra> The manner of appearing as anything from nothing,
[11497] <tantra> The manner of qualities unobstructed,
[11498] <tantra> The unobstructed appearance of spontaneous presence,
[11499] <tantra> As the nature of various appearances,
[11500] <tantra> Appears as great qualities.
[11501] <tantra> From the eight gates of appearance,
[11502] <tantra> Appear in the manner of eight qualities."
[11503] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11504] In the place of the appearance of the eight outward-projecting modes of spontaneous presence, it is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of Ground-Appearance.
[11505] The complete primordial ground,
[11506] The ground and the ground of spontaneous presence of natural sleep, the Precious Casket,
[11507] The complete fruition, the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of Secret Casket,
[11508] These are explained as the three caskets of spontaneous presence.
[11509] The ground appearing is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of the Path.
[11510] When taking into experience, all the wisdoms of the four appearances and all path appearances arise from this.
[11511] From the eight gates of spontaneous presence appearance, all dharmas of samsara and nirvana arise with unobstructed gates,
[11512] Particularly, from the self-light of form and wisdom, the ground Sambhogakaya appearance of clear light pure elements appears as original presence.
[11513] The warm aspect of the wisdom fire,
[11514] The cool water of compassion gathering,
[11515] The light earth abiding in the expanse,
[11516] The moving aspect of the fivefold self-power wind abiding, the appearance of the mandala.
[11517] From the tones or power of that appearance, Natural Nirmanakaya fields are adorned with immeasurable richness.
[11518] From those tones, Nirmanakayas subduing beings work for the benefit of the appearance of wandering beings.
[11519] The impure Nirmanakaya appearance increases and is established.
[11520] Though these were shown above,
[11521] Because they were explained extensively,
[11522] For the sake of easy understanding, they are further explained.
[11523] From the Auspicious Beautiful:
[11524] <tantra> "From that arises the manner of appearance of the Precious Spontaneous Presence.
[11525] <tantra> This is called the ground from which all dharmas arise for the Buddha.
[11526] <tantra> From that the Buddha arises.
[11527] <tantra> Sentient beings arise.
[11528] <tantra> Wisdom arises.
[11529] <tantra> Light arises.
[11530] <tantra> Rigpa arises.
[11531] <tantra> Non-recognition arises.
[11532] <tantra> All karma arises.
[11533] <tantra> Compassion arises.
[11534] <tantra> Appearances as existence arise.
[11535] <tantra> This is the essence.
[11536] <tantra> The nature appears as such.
[11537] <tantra> Compassion appears as such.
[11538] <tantra> Power exists.
[11539] <tantra> Appearance exists.
[11540] <tantra> Mind exists.
[11541] <tantra> Mentality exists.
[11542] <tantra> Error exists.
[11543] <tantra> Non-error also exists.
[11544] <tantra> The great arising of all.
[11545] <tantra> This is called the great expanse of Buddhas and sentient beings.
[11546] <tantra> From that arises the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance.
[11547] <tantra> This is called the ground of manifest path appearance.
[11548] <tantra> This is luminous,
[11549] <tantra> Warm,
[11550] <tantra> Cool,
[11551] <tantra> Light,
[11552] <tantra> Possessing the nature of the moving,
[11553] <tantra> Possessing the five bodies,
[11554] <tantra> Possessing the five wisdoms,
[11555] <tantra> The five families,
[11556] <tantra> The five colors,
[11557] <tantra> The five lights,
[11558] <tantra> The five fathers,
[11559] <tantra> The five mothers,
[11560] <tantra> The five forms,
[11561] <tantra> The five sounds,
[11562] <tantra> The five smells,
[11563] <tantra> The five tastes,
[11564] <tantra> The five touches,
[11565] <tantra> The five dharmas,
[11566] <tantra> The five appearances,
[11567] <tantra> The five principal ones,
[11568] <tantra> Possessing the five retinues."
[11569] <tantra> These possess the thirty-two major marks.
[11570] <tantra> Possessing the eighty minor marks.
[11571] <tantra> Possessing the six broad dharmas.
[11572] <tantra> This is the manner of Sambhogakaya appearance,
[11573] <tantra> The connection arising from that and that.
[11574] <tantra> From that appearance, the appearance of Natural Nirmanakaya,
[11575] <tantra> The manner of Nirmanakaya appearance subduing beings,
[11576] <tantra> The manner of impure Nirmanakaya appearance is established.
[11577] <tantra> The Natural Nirmanakaya body itself
[11578] <tantra> Arises from spontaneous presence.
[11579] <tantra> The manner of appearance of that Natural Nirmanakaya body is:
[11580] <tantra> Enjoyment inexhaustible,
[11581] <tantra> Retinue inexhaustible,
[11582] <tantra> Qualities unknowable,
[11583] <tantra> Power unknowable,
[11584] <tantra> Power unknowable,
[11585] <tantra> Miracles unknowable,
[11586] <tantra> Lifespan immeasurable,
[11587] <tantra> Free from all suffering of illness,
[11588] <tantra> The palace inconceivable,
[11589] <tantra> Teaching dharmas inconceivable.
[11590] <tantra> This is called the manner of Natural Nirmanakaya appearance.
[11591] <tantra> From that arises the Nirmanakaya subduing beings.
[11592] <tantra> That appears as diversity, knowing the meaning of diversity,
[11593] <tantra> Though appearing, not interrupted,
[11594] <tantra> Not attached to appearance,
[11595] <tantra> Possessing pure eyes,
[11596] <tantra> Possessing pure ears,
[11597] <tantra> Possessing pure nose,
[11598] <tantra> Possessing pure tongue,
[11599] <tantra> Possessing pure body,
[11600] <tantra> Possessing pure mind,
[11601] <tantra> Showing various compassionate activities,
[11602] <tantra> Possessing special wisdom,
[11603] <tantra> Appearing everywhere with unobstructed knowledge.
[11604] <tantra> This is the Nirmanakaya subduing beings.
[11605] <tantra> From that arises the impure world-system.
[11606] <tantra> This appears in the following manner as the great appearance:
[11607] <tantra> From the arising of the outer container of the five elements' mandala,
[11608] <tantra> Earth,
[11609] <tantra> Water,
[11610] <tantra> Fire,
[11611] <tantra> Wind,
[11612] <tantra> The great element space exists.
[11613] <tantra> From that, the mind of the holder cannot be expressed in words,
[11614] <tantra> Desire,
[11615] <tantra> Anger,
[11616] <tantra> Delusion,
[11617] <tantra> Pride,
[11618] <tantra> Jealousy,
[11619] <tantra> And hatred—the six.
[11620] <tantra> From that arise the six classes of beings.
[11621] <tantra> From jealousy, humans are established.
[11622] <tantra> From hatred, gods are established.
[11623] <tantra> From pride, demigods are established.
[11624] <tantra> From desire, hungry ghosts are established.
[11625] <tantra> From delusion, animals are established.
[11626] <tantra> From black anger, hell beings are established.
[11627] <tantra> Thus the appearances of the six classes are established.
[11628] <tantra> This is the place of samsara.
[11629] <tantra> This too arises from the one great nature in four manners of appearance.
[11630] <tantra> From the four natures, four manners of appearance arise.
[11631] <tantra> The four great appearances are:
[11632] <tantra> Spontaneous presence appearing as diversity.
[11633] <tantra> Sambhogakaya abiding as the illusory nature of light with eyes and ears.
[11634] <tantra> Nirmanakaya appearing as form.
[11635] <tantra> Sentient beings appearing as different though appearing.
[11636] <tantra> This too is called the obscuration of the manner of appearance for sentient beings.
[11637] <tantra> When all this is condensed,
[11638] <tantra> Below the primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,
[11639] <tantra> From the eight modes of spontaneous presence gate, the wisdom appearance Sambhogakaya,
[11640] <tantra> From that power directly, immeasurable appearances of the five families,
[11641] <tantra> The Natural Nirmanakaya appears,
[11642] <tantra> Below showing the realms of the six migrations with their tamer.
[11643] <tantra> The three body appearances arising as three tiers is the appearance of the Ground of Spontaneous Presence.
[11644] <tantra> The Sambhogakaya appearing to oneself, the Buddhas of the Natural Nirmanakayas subduing beings, are the power of one's own ground-appearance.
[11645] <tantra> They do not exist now in any particular direction,
[11646] <tantra> Because they are appearances of self-rigpa, they abide together with self-rigpa.
[11647] <tantra> The appearance of the six migrations of self-appearance also does not exist elsewhere, but self-arises from the unobstructed manner of appearance like the gate of impure samsara.
[11648] <tantra> Thus, though this appearance exists for each individually,
[11649] <tantra> The common aspect of the common world is through common karma,
[11650] <tantra> Arranged by the Teacher's activity.
[11651] <tantra> The aspect appearing as error to oneself, though appearing, is arranged by the gate of self-appearance samsara.
[11652] <tantra> The aspect of self-appearance goes to self-reversal when the casket shifts.
[11653] <tantra> The common remains elsewhere, still wandering.
[11654] <tantra> Distinguishing these two is extremely important.
[11655] <tantra> Naturally, from the gate of self-arisen spontaneous presence in rigpa, the appearance of the six migrations exists.
[11656] <tantra> The key point is that the deluded appearance, dream-like, must be sent to self-reversal in the ground of primordial purity without appearance.
[11657] <tantra> In the bardo too, the six migrations of one's own face, whether the Nirmanakayas of self-appearance work for benefit or not, are explained as two aspects.
[11658] <tantra> Before the gate of impure samsara arises, if one knows one's own self-appearance, there is no benefit to be done,
[11659] <tantra> Because the object of activity does not appear.
[11660] <tantra> Once arisen, benefit must be done,
[11661] <tantra> Because liberation is impossible without exhausting deluded appearance.
[11662] <tantra> This key point is subtle yet of great importance.
[11663] <tantra> This key point is subtle yet of great importance.
