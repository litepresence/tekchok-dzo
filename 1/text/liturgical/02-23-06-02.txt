[14200] Second and Third have twenty-four each
[14201] The remaining three have six each, thus divided into portions making one hundred thirty-four
[14202] Those also gathered into six groups of six
[14203] <list>The thirty-six's fifth—the six faculties with outflows,</list>
[14204] <list>The first group's six faculties seeing beyond—thirty without outflows,</list>
[14205] <list>The last, utterly without outflows, should be known.</list>
[14206] Those from the <tantra>Sun-Moon Union</tantra>:
[14207] Thus arising in that manner, the six clairvoyances arise for that class:
[14208] <verse>knowledge of previous realms,</verse>
[14209] <verse>death and transmigration,</verse>
[14210] <verse>knowledge of birth,</verse>
[14211] <verse>knowledge of others' minds,</verse>
[14212] <verse>knowledge of all hidden appearances,</verse>
[14213] <verse>seeing and knowing the six realms,</verse>
[14214] <verse>clairvoyance of purified faculties—</verse>
[14215] six arise, thus.
[14216] <verse>The fourth: attainment of retentive powers,</verse>
[14217] <verse>Previously heard Dharma all appearing simultaneously,</verse>
[14218] <verse>Innumerable Dharma categories never before heard also arising,</verse>
[14219] <verse>Therefore called the Dharmata bardo,</verse>
[14220] <verse>From that itself: at that time, retentive powers of non-forgetting</verse>
[14221] <verse>Arise in one's own continuum,</verse>
[14222] <verse>All previous Dharma appearing simultaneously in the continuum,</verse>
[14223] <verse>Likewise, never-before-heard Dharma also arising,</verse>
[14224] <verse>Therefore called the Dharmata bardo, thus.</verse>
[14225] <verse>The fifth: manner of meditative absorption's arising—</verse>
[14226] <verse>At that time, mind's engagement exhausted in the manner of Dharmata's purity,</verse>
[14227] <verse>Abiding non-conceptually.</verse>
[14228] <verse>The manner of exhaustion:</verse>
[14229] <verse>Where exhausted, exhausted in one's own continuum;</verse> <verse>How exhausted? The appearance-rain of the above qualities</verse> <verse>Exhausted in the manner of Dharmata's purity.</verse> <verse>What is that appearance at that time?</verse> <verse>The appearance of Dharmata's exhaustion arising,</verse> <verse>Bad conceptuality—previous clinging</verse>
[14230] <verse>Subsequent grasping,</verse>
[14231] <verse>Good clairvoyance,</verse>
[14232] <verse>Recollection, and so forth—</verse>
[14233] <verse>Do not arise at all,</verse>
[14234] <verse>Like the state of pure space.</verse>
[14235] <tantra>From the Sun-Moon Union:</tantra>
[14236] <verse>Continuous meditative absorption's continuum</verse>
[14237] <verse>Arising as its own nature,</verse>
[14238] <verse>Bad conceptuality does not arise at all,</verse>
[14239] <verse>Thus.</verse>
[14240] At this point, the liberation and delusion modes of the twenty-one faculties should be known.
[14241] As the text is somewhat extensive, shown separately below.
[14242] <verse>The sixth: spontaneous presence's dissolution manner—</verse>
[14243] <verse>Previously arisen now gathering within:</verse>
[14244] <verse>Dissolution modes eight arising simultaneously.</verse>
[14245] <verse>Compassion dissolving into compassion,</verse>
[14246] <verse>Like the sun's rays gathering at sunset;</verse>
[14247] <verse>The appearance-rain of the six families</verse>
[14248] <verse>Light dissolving into light,</verse>
[14249] <verse>Like a rainbow dissolving in space—</verse>
[14250] <verse>No trace of light and color signs,</verse>
[14251] <verse>The expanse free from grasping at emptiness,</verse>
[14252] <verse>Of single taste;</verse>
[14253] <verse>Body dissolving into Body,</verse>
[14254] <verse>Like a vase body,</verse>
[14255] <verse>Knowables luminous within,</verse>
[14256] <verse>No accomplished sign-marked face and hands,</verse>
[14257] <verse>Completely pure;</verse>
[14258] <verse>Pristine cognition dissolving into pristine cognition,</verse>
[14259] <verse>Like a child entering the mother's lap—</verse>
[14260] <verse>Dharmata mother and child without duality merged,</verse>
[14261] <verse>No grasping;</verse>
[14262] <verse>Non-duality dissolving into non-duality,</verse>
[14263] <verse>Like a river dissolving into a river—</verse>
[14264] <verse>Liberated from the beginning,</verse>
[14265] <verse>Of single taste as Dharmakaya,</verse>
[14266]
[14267]
[14268]
[14269]
[14270]
[14271]
[14272]
[14273]
[14274]
[14275]
[14276]
