[14200] Second and Third have twenty-four each
[14201] The remaining three have six each, thus divided into portions making one hundred thirty-four
[14202] Those also gathered into six groups of six
[14203] <list>The thirty-six's fifth—the six faculties with outflows,
[14204] <list>The first group's six faculties seeing beyond—thirty without outflows,
[14205] <list>The last, utterly without outflows, should be known.
[14206] <prose>Those from the <tantra>Sun-Moon Union:
[14207] Thus arising in that manner, the six clairvoyances arise for that class:
[14208] <verse>knowledge of previous realms,
[14209] <verse>death and transmigration, || 10 ||
[14210] <verse>knowledge of birth,
[14211] <verse>knowledge of others' minds,
[14212] <verse>knowledge of all hidden appearances,
[14213] <verse>seeing and knowing the six realms,
[14214] <verse>clairvoyance of purified faculties—
[14215] six arise, thus.
[14216] <verse>The fourth: attainment of retentive powers,
[14217] <verse>Previously heard Dharma all appearing simultaneously,
[14218] <verse>Innumerable Dharma categories never before heard also arising,
[14219] <verse>Therefore called the Dharmata bardo, || 20 ||
[14220] <verse>From that itself: at that time, retentive powers of non-forgetting
[14221] <verse>Arise in one's own continuum,
[14222] <verse>All previous Dharma appearing simultaneously in the continuum,
[14223] <verse>Likewise, never-before-heard Dharma also arising,
[14224] <verse>Therefore called the Dharmata bardo, thus.
[14225] <verse>The fifth: manner of meditative absorption's arising—
[14226] <verse>At that time, mind's engagement exhausted in the manner of Dharmata's purity,
[14227] <verse>Abiding non-conceptually.
[14228] <verse>The manner of exhaustion:
[14229] <verse>Where exhausted, exhausted in one's own continuum; <verse>How exhausted? The appearance-rain of the above qualities <verse>Exhausted in the manner of Dharmata's purity. <verse>What is that appearance at that time? <verse>The appearance of Dharmata's exhaustion arising, <verse>Bad conceptuality—previous clinging || 30 ||
[14230] <verse>Subsequent grasping,
[14231] <verse>Good clairvoyance,
[14232] <verse>Recollection, and so forth—
[14233] <verse>Do not arise at all,
[14234] <verse>Like the state of pure space.
[14235] <prose><tantra>From the Sun-Moon Union:
[14236] <verse>Continuous meditative absorption's continuum
[14237] <verse>Arising as its own nature,
[14238] <verse>Bad conceptuality does not arise at all,
[14239] <verse>Thus. || 40 ||
[14240] At this point, the liberation and delusion modes of the twenty-one faculties should be known.
[14241] As the text is somewhat extensive, shown separately below.
[14242] <verse>The sixth: spontaneous presence's dissolution manner—
[14243] <verse>Previously arisen now gathering within:
[14244] <verse>Dissolution modes eight arising simultaneously.
[14245] <verse>Compassion dissolving into compassion,
[14246] <verse>Like the sun's rays gathering at sunset;
[14247] <verse>The appearance-rain of the six families
[14248] <verse>Light dissolving into light,
[14249] <verse>Like a rainbow dissolving in space— || 50 ||
[14250] <verse>No trace of light and color signs,
[14251] <verse>The expanse free from grasping at emptiness,
[14252] <verse>Of single taste;
[14253] <verse>Body dissolving into Body,
[14254] <verse>Like a vase body,
[14255] <verse>Knowables luminous within,
[14256] <verse>No accomplished sign-marked face and hands,
[14257] <verse>Completely pure;
[14258] <verse>Pristine cognition dissolving into pristine cognition,
[14259] <verse>Like a child entering the mother's lap— || 60 ||
[14260] <verse>Dharmata mother and child without duality merged,
[14261] <verse>No grasping;
[14262] <verse>Non-duality dissolving into non-duality,
[14263] <verse>Like a river dissolving into a river—
[14264] <verse>Liberated from the beginning,
[14265] <verse>Of single taste as Dharmakaya,
[14266]
[14267]
[14268]
[14269] || 70 ||
[14270]
[14271]
[14272]
[14273]
[14274]
[14275]
[14276]
[14277]
