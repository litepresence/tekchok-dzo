[4172] The tantra of indicating words is two:
[4173] The tantra of meaning:
[4174] Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] Always abiding in all, is thus called tantra,
[4176] Being the lineage of the Buddha, thus from tantra,
[4177] Holding the characteristic of the Buddha, thus placed in tantra.
[4178] The tantra of words:
[4179] That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, and so forth—divided,
[4180] Is the chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] The chief discerning of the completion sequence,
[4182] Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] Showing beyond all: the key points of the Great Perfection.
[4184] The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
<list> [4185] First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,
<list> [4186] Deity and mantra—two,
<list> [4187] Maṇḍala and offering—two,
<list> [4188] Samādhi and conduct—two,
<list> [4189] Activity and view—two. Ten complete: the chief tantra of the creation sequence.
[4190] The rising measure of the completion sequence:
<list> [4191] View and fruition—two,
<list> [4192] Conduct and meditation—two,
<list> [4193] Mind and wisdom—two,
<list> [4194] Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.
[4195] The non-dual union:
[4196] Both must complete—eighteen.
[4197] The completely perfect Great:
[4198] From creation and completion, the completion sequence.
[4199] The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two,
[4202] Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] Fruition and five complete.
[4204] Examples: like the warp,
[4205] Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] Valid as tantra.
[4209] That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in tantra.
[4210] Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
[4211] The meaning tantra and word tantra are extensively explained.
[4212] First: two,
[4213] Method tantra,
[4214] Nature tantra.
[4215] First:
[4216] Awareness and that meaning's experience-taking instructions.
[4217] Divided: indicated method tantra,
[4218] Indicating method tantra, two.
[4219] First, nature:
[4220] Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment.
[4221] Definite term: that same indicating meaning and realizing basis and liberating method, thus
[4222] Called indicated method tantra.
[4223] Divided:
[4224] Emptiness,
[4225] Clarity, two.
[4226] Emptiness: awareness's nature, all empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration's end.
[4227] Clarity:
[4228] That too, not gone to the extreme of emptiness, self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance,
[4229] Warm, cool, light,
[4230] Vast nature's chief great elements five, primordially spontaneously accomplished,
[4231] Compassion's tone unceasing, arising as capacity, awareness primordially pervading.
[4232] That too, awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings,
[4233] Called indicated method tantra.
[4234] From the Pearl Garland:
<tantra> [4235] All buddhas' method tantra,
<tantra> [4236] From the distinction of one basis nature,
<tantra> [4237] Indicated and indicating,
<tantra> [4238] Indicated tantra, one, all-pervading,
<tantra> [4239] All that connected to its trace,
<tantra> [4240] Pervading aspects two:
<tantra> [4241] Pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity,
<tantra> [4242] One cause of emptiness, without thing,
<tantra> [4243] Beyond all things' dharma,
<tantra> [4244] Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading,
<tantra> [4245] Becoming the basis of all, one nature,
<tantra> [4246] Pervading lord itself gathered,
<tantra> [4247] Birthless, memory exhausted,
<tantra> [4248] From the distinction of nature itself,
<tantra> [4249] Empty and appearing, appearing and empty,
<tantra> [4250] Things, without things, also are,
<tantra> [4251] Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness,
<tantra> [4252] Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object,
<tantra> [4253] Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature,
<tantra> [4254] Without stain, unmixed, perfect,
<tantra> [4255] Thoughtless, empty nature,
<tantra> [4256] Pervading by emptiness, thus called tantra.
<tantra> [4257] Clear, nature unceasing,
<tantra> [4258] Illuminating appearance, all-pervading,
<tantra> [4259] Clear, warm, cool,
<tantra> [4260] Vast, moving, nature holding,
<tantra> [4261] Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear,
<tantra> [4262] Liberating, ripening seed,
<tantra> [4263] Reverse from emptiness, clear pervading,
<tantra> [4264] Instant, self-liberation,
<tantra> [4265] Self-arising clarity, body connected,
<tantra> [4266] Without stain, particularly clear,
<tantra> [4267] Graspless, clear object appearing,
<tantra> [4268] Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect,
<tantra> [4269] Body clear pervading, thus called tantra.
[4270] Thus it is spoken.
[4271] Second, indicating method tantra: three.
[4272] Nature:
[4273] The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method.
[4274] Definite term:
[4275] Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating,
[4276] As realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method tantra.
[4277] Generally, explanation tantras: words long, difficult,
[4278] Instruction tantras: words clear, easy,
[4279] Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
[4280] Divided:
<list> [4281] Showing effortless primordial liberation,
<list> [4282] Showing with effort through sequence, two.
