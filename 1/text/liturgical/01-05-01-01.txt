[4172] The tantra of indicating words, two:
[4173] The tantra of meaning:
[4174] Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] Always abiding in all, thus tantra,
[4176] Being the lineage of buddha, thus from tantra,
[4177] Holding the characteristic of buddha, thus placed in tantra.
[4178] The tantra of words:
[4179] That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, etc.—divided,
[4180] The chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] The chief discerning of the completion sequence,
[4182] Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] Showing beyond all: the key points of Great Perfection.
[4184] The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
[4185] First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,
[4186] Deity and mantra—two,
[4187] Maṇḍala and offering—two,
[4188] Samādhi and conduct—two,
[4189] Activity and view—two. Ten complete: the chief tantra of the creation sequence.

[4192] Conduct and meditation—two,
[4193] Mind and wisdom—two,
[4194] Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.
[4195] The non-dual union:
[4196] Both must complete—eighteen.
[4197] The completely perfect Great:
[4198] From creation and completion, the completion sequence.
[4199] The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two,
[4202] Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] Fruition and five complete.
[4204] Examples: like the warp,
[4205] Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] Valid as tantra.
[4209] That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in tantra.
