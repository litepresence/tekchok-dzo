[4172] The tantra of indicating words is two:
[4173] The tantra of meaning:
[4174] Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] Always abiding in all, is thus called tantra,
[4176] Being the lineage of the Buddha, thus from tantra,
[4177] Holding the characteristic of the Buddha, thus placed in tantra.
[4178] The tantra of words:
[4179] That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, and so forth—divided,
[4180] Is the chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] The chief discerning of the completion sequence, || 10 ||
[4182] Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] Showing beyond all: the key points of the Great Perfection.
[4184] The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
[4185] <list> First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,
[4186] <list> Deity and mantra—two,
[4187] <list> Maṇḍala and offering—two,
[4188] <list> Samādhi and conduct—two,
[4189] <list> Activity and view—two. Ten complete: the chief tantra of the creation sequence.
[4190] The rising measure of the completion sequence:
[4191] <list> View and fruition—two, || 20 ||
[4192] <list> Conduct and meditation—two,
[4193] <list> Mind and wisdom—two,
[4194] <list> Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.
[4195] The non-dual union:
[4196] Both must complete—eighteen.
[4197] The completely perfect Great:
[4198] From creation and completion, the completion sequence.
[4199] The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two, || 30 ||
[4202] Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] Fruition and five complete.
[4204] Examples: like the warp,
[4205] Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] Valid as tantra.
[4209] That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in tantra.
[4210] Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
[4211] The meaning tantra and word tantra are extensively explained. || 40 ||
[4212] First: two,
[4213] Method tantra,
[4214] Nature tantra.
[4215] First:
[4216] Awareness and that meaning's experience-taking instructions.
[4217] Divided: indicated method tantra,
[4218] Indicating method tantra, two.
[4219] First, nature:
[4220] Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment.
[4221] Definite term: that same indicating meaning and realizing basis and liberating method, thus || 50 ||
[4222] Called indicated method tantra.
[4223] Divided:
[4224] Emptiness,
[4225] Clarity, two.
[4226] Emptiness: awareness's nature, all empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration's end.
[4227] Clarity:
[4228] That too, not gone to the extreme of emptiness, self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance,
[4229] Warm, cool, light,
[4230] Vast nature's chief great elements five, primordially spontaneously accomplished,
[4231] Compassion's tone unceasing, arising as capacity, awareness primordially pervading. || 60 ||
[4232] That too, awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings,
[4233] Called indicated method tantra.
[4234] From the Pearl Garland:
[4235] <tantra> All buddhas' method tantra,
[4236] <tantra> From the distinction of one basis nature,
[4237] <tantra> Indicated and indicating,
[4238] <tantra> Indicated tantra, one, all-pervading,
[4239] <tantra> All that connected to its trace,
[4240] <tantra> Pervading aspects two:
[4241] <tantra> Pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity, || 70 ||
[4242] <tantra> One cause of emptiness, without thing,
[4243] <tantra> Beyond all things' dharma,
[4244] <tantra> Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading,
[4245] <tantra> Becoming the basis of all, one nature,
[4246] <tantra> Pervading lord itself gathered,
[4247] <tantra> Birthless, memory exhausted,
[4248] <tantra> From the distinction of nature itself,
[4249] <tantra> Empty and appearing, appearing and empty,
[4250] <tantra> Things, without things, also are,
[4251] <tantra> Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness, || 80 ||
[4252] <tantra> Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object,
[4253] <tantra> Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature,
[4254] <tantra> Without stain, unmixed, perfect,
[4255] <tantra> Thoughtless, empty nature,
[4256] <tantra> Pervading by emptiness, thus called tantra.
[4257] <tantra> Clear, nature unceasing,
[4258] <tantra> Illuminating appearance, all-pervading,
[4259] <tantra> Clear, warm, cool,
[4260] <tantra> Vast, moving, nature holding,
[4261] <tantra> Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear, || 90 ||
[4262] <tantra> Liberating, ripening seed,
[4263] <tantra> Reverse from emptiness, clear pervading,
[4264] <tantra> Instant, self-liberation,
[4265] <tantra> Self-arising clarity, body connected,
[4266] <tantra> Without stain, particularly clear,
[4267] <tantra> Graspless, clear object appearing,
[4268] <tantra> Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect,
[4269] <tantra> Body clear pervading, thus called tantra.
[4270] Thus it is spoken.
[4271] Second, indicating method tantra: three. || 100 ||
[4272] Nature:
[4273] The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method.
[4274] Definite term:
[4275] Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating,
[4276] As realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method tantra.
[4277] Generally, explanation tantras: words long, difficult,
[4278] Instruction tantras: words clear, easy,
[4279] Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
[4280] Divided:
[4281] <list> Showing effortless primordial liberation, || 110 ||
[4282] <list> Showing with effort through sequence, two.
