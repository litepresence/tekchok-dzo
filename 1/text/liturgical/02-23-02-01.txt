[12251] Difficult to be born: born in the place of dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent. Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments. Difficult to meet: meeting master virtuous friend. Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy dharma jewel. Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong. Difficult to abandon: abandoning samsara's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's buddha-continent—now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible. Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.
[12252] From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:
[12253] Remaining in favorable land,
[12254] Relying on holy birth-beings,
[12255] Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,
[12256] You possess the four great wheels—thus.
[12257] From the presence of Arya Shantideva:
[12258] This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;
[12259] For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,
[12260] If effort is not made in this,
[12261] Where will proper obtainment be later?
[12262] Having obtained such leisure,
[12263] If effort is not made now,
[12264] Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;
[12265] In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,
[12266] Not even hearing the sound of happy path,
[12267] What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said.
[12268] That too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma. Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power. Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.

[12284] Possessing retinue, enjoyment, prosperity.
[12285] Where to be born depends on present thought-conduct.
[12286] Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation.
[12287] First, possessing retinue:
[12288] When possessing a retinue of disciples,
[12289] One has gathered the accumulations and benefits beings.
[12290] Thus possessing retinue.
[12291] Second, enjoyment:
[12292] The enjoyment of Dharma, the supreme bliss,
[12293] Not worldly pleasure, but the joy of liberation.
[12294] Thus enjoyment.
[12295] Third, prosperity:
[12296] The prosperity of virtue and wisdom,
[12297] The wealth of the seven noble riches.
[12298] Thus prosperity.
[12299] Fourth, where to be born depends on present thought-conduct:
[12300] The realm of rebirth is determined by present mind and action,
[12301] Virtuous conduct leads to higher realms,
[12302] Non-virtuous conduct leads to lower realms.
[12303] Thus where to be born depends on thought-conduct.
[12304] Fifth, Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation:
[12305] As stated in the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:
[12306] "Through virtuous thought and conduct,  [12524] One attains the higher realms and liberation.  [12525] Through non-virtuous thought and conduct,  [12526] One falls into the lower realms of suffering."  [12527] Thus the quotation.  [12528] Herein, the importance of thought:  [12529] Thought is the forerunner of all actions,  [12530] Pure thought leads to pure results.  [12531] Thus the importance of thought.  [12532] Herein, the importance of conduct:  [12533] Conduct manifests thought in action,  [12534] Virtuous conduct purifies the mind.  [12535] Thus the importance of conduct.  [12536] Herein, the result:  [12537] Through pure thought and conduct,  [12538] One attains the higher realms and liberation.  [12539] Thus the result.  [12540] Herein, the summary:  [12541] Retinue, enjoyment, and prosperity arise from virtue.  [12542] Rebirth depends on present thought and conduct.  [12543] Thus the summary.  [12544] Thus possessing retinue, enjoyment, and prosperity is explained.  [12545] Thus the dependence of rebirth on thought-conduct is established.  [12546] Thus the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement quotation is complete.

[12307] For dharma alone benefits; other than dharma, nothing reaches benefit. From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[12308] Here father, mother, relatives,
[12309] Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;
[12310] Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.
[12311] Except these quality-possessors,
[12312] No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.
[12313] From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[12314] As time's danger, king becoming to go,
[12315] Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;
[12316] Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,
[12317] Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.
[12318] Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded, like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation dharma.
[12319] Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion? From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[12320] In coarse element forms,
[12321] Alas, no ground to sit;
[12322] To birth-being's stable life breath,
[12323] Alas, time does not strike;
[12324] In group six's object appearance,
[12325] Alas, nothing permanent;
[12326] In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[12327] Alas, nothing exhausts;
[12328] In suffering arisen from body,
[12329] Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[12330] Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused. Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others, enemies conquered, lands obtained—yet doing whatever, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.

[12345] From the presence of Glorious Atisha:
[12346] Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
[12347] All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
[12348] Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—
[12349] Habituate looking at self's mind,
[12350] Like thus requested.
