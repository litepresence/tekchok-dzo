[12245] <prose>First, three aspects:</prose>
[12246] <prose>Contemplating the difficulty of obtaining, train in Dharma without leisure-freedom intermission.</prose>
[12247] <prose>The training procedure is explained.</prose>
[12248] <prose>Contemplating the cause of certain decay, always produce definite-emerge and weariness.</prose>
[12249] <prose>Contemplating the simile of certain death, meditate on profound meaning of emptiness when the time comes.</prose>
[12250] <prose>The first:</prose>
[12251] <verse>Difficult to be born: born in the place of Dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent.</verse>
[12252] <verse>Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments.</verse>
[12253] <verse>Difficult to meet: meeting Master Virtuous Friend.</verse>
[12254] <verse>Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy Dharma jewel.</verse>
[12255] <verse>Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong.</verse>
[12256] <verse>Difficult to abandon: abandoning Samsara's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's Buddha-continent—</verse>
[12257] <verse>now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible.</verse>
[12258] <verse>Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.</verse>
[12259] <tantra>From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:</tantra>
[12260] <tantra>Remaining in favorable land,</tantra>
[12261] <tantra>Relying on holy birth-beings,</tantra>
[12262] <tantra>Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,</tantra>
[12263] <tantra>You possess the four great wheels—thus.</tantra>
[12264] <tantra>From the presence of Arya Shantideva:</tantra>
[12265] <tantra>This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;</tantra>
[12266] <tantra>For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,</tantra>
[12267] <tantra>If effort is not made in this,</tantra>
[12268] <tantra>Where will proper obtainment be later?</tantra>
[12269] <tantra>Having obtained such leisure,</tantra>
[12270] <tantra>If effort is not made now,</tantra>
[12271] <tantra>Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;</tantra>
[12272] <tantra>In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,</tantra>
[12273] <tantra>Not even hearing the sound of happy path,</tantra>
[12274] <tantra>What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said.</tantra>
[12275] <prose>That too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma.</prose>
[12276] <prose>Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power.</prose>
[12277] <prose>Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.</prose>
[12278] <prose>Possessing retinue, enjoyment, prosperity, always possessing autonomy and so forth.</prose>
[12279] <prose>Where to be born next also depends on present thought-conduct virtuous or non-virtuous.</prose>
[12280] <prose>Those possessing the gathered accumulations, practicing giving, ethics and so forth, are born in happy path higher realm's world, high with retinue and prosperity.</prose>
[12281] <prose>Those abiding in patience, kindness and so forth, possessing beautiful forms.</prose>
[12282] <prose>Having made helper, protector-shelter, born in central land.</prose>
[12283] <prose>Honored by all, born without harm by others.</prose>
[12284] <prose>Those before who venerated Master and practiced Dharma.</prose>
[12285] <prose>Now meet true Master Virtuous Friend and practice Dharma.</prose>
[12286] <prose>Born in good land possessing all desires.</prose>
[12287] <prose>Those before who venerated Three Jewels, offering.</prose>
[12288] <prose>Here also well renounced.</prose>
[12289] <prose>Completed ordination, abiding in pure conduct until life's end.</prose>
[12290] <prose>Practicing holy vehicle Dharma.</prose>
[12291] <prose>Those before trained in hearing, contemplation, meditation.</prose>
[12292] <prose>Here also great wisdom, Dharma's limitless door, through hearing, contemplation and meditation accomplish self and others' two benefits and so forth, immeasurable qualities.</prose>
[12293] <prose>Those before who did evil, non-virtuous karma, here also born in various lower paths.</prose>
[12294] <prose>Even obtaining higher realm, incomplete faculties and so forth, poor, born with little merit.</prose>
[12295] <prose>Here also practicing non-virtue, later too born in suffering class.</prose>
[12296] <prose>In brief, previous life whatever done, known through present body-mind's pleasure-pain and aspects.</prose>
[12297] <prose>Where born next depends on present thought-conduct.</prose>
[12298] <prose>From the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:</prose>
[12299] <sutra>Before, what done, look at present body;</sutra>
[12300] <sutra>Where going next, look at present mind—thus.</sutra>
[12301] <prose>Thus thinking, now abandon non-virtue, accomplish virtue, always abide mind in holy Dharma.</prose>
[12302] <prose>For Dharma alone benefits; other than Dharma, nothing reaches benefit.</prose>
[12303] <prose>From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:</prose>
[12304] <sutra>Here father, mother, relatives,</sutra>
[12305] <sutra>Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;</sutra>
[12306] <sutra>Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.</sutra>
[12307] <sutra>Except these quality-possessors,</sutra>
[12308] <sutra>No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.</sutra>
[12309] <prose>From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:</prose>
[12310] <sutra>As time's danger, king becoming to go,</sutra>
[12311] <sutra>Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;</sutra>
[12312] <sutra>Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,</sutra>
[12313] <sutra>Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.</sutra>
[12314] <prose>Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay:</prose>
[12315] <prose>having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded,</prose>
[12316] <prose>like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation Dharma.</prose>
[12317] <prose>Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion?</prose>
[12318] <prose>From the Ratnagotra Tantra:</prose>
[12319] <tantra>In coarse element forms,</tantra>
[12320] <tantra>Alas, no ground to sit;</tantra>
[12321] <tantra>To birth-being's stable life breath,</tantra>
[12322] <tantra>Alas, time does not strike;</tantra>
[12323] <tantra>In group six's object appearance,</tantra>
[12324] <tantra>Alas, nothing permanent;</tantra>
[12325] <tantra>In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,</tantra>
[12326] <tantra>Alas, nothing exhausts;</tantra>
[12327] <tantra>In suffering arisen from body,</tantra>
[12328] <tantra>Alas, nothing pure—thus.</tantra>
[12329] <prose>Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused.</prose>
[12330] <prose>Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others?</prose>
[12331] <prose>Enemies conquered?</prose>
[12332] <prose>Lands obtained?</prose>
[12333] <prose>Whatever done, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.</prose>
[12334] <prose>Thus though impermanent,</prose>
[12335] <prose>grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused.</prose>
[12336] <prose>Thinking from heart: self must not become like that.</prose>
[12337] <prose>By self benefit given to others?</prose>
[12338] <prose>Enemies conquered?</prose>
[12339] <prose>Lands obtained?</prose>
[12340] <prose>Whatever done, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.</prose>
[12341] <tantra>From the presence of Glorious Atisha:</tantra>
[12342] <tantra>Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,</tantra>
[12343] <tantra>All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;</tantra>
[12344] <tantra>Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—</tantra>
[12345] <tantra>Habituate looking at self's mind,</tantra>
[12346] <tantra>Like thus requested.</tantra>
