[15778] <prose> First:
[15779] <prose> That channel-from move only one-from,
[15780] <prose> Karma and wisdom two individual move what.
[15781] <prose> Or move different two natures,
[15782] <prose> One two not-tenable,
[15783] <prose> Move only one,
[15784] <prose> Samsara-nirvana whichever one-from not-tenable.
[15785] <prose> Answer move only one also channel twist-not twist move-from wisdom wind become action bliss-power,
[15786] <prose> Emptiness,
[15787] <prose> Clear empty wisdom wind called. || 10 ||
[15788] <prose> Channel location move twist-from karma wind become action conceptual different non-virtuous connection various,
[15789] <prose> Not-clear,
[15790] <prose> Dull,
[15791] <prose> Agitated,
[15792] <prose> Torpid,
[15793] <prose> Coiled etc. wind defective arise.
[15794] <prose> Example cowherd son one angered tiger become,
[15795] <prose> Not-angered human come like,
[15796] <prose> Awareness resonance body channel-from move wind only one also, || 20 ||
[15797] <prose> Channel twist twist-not-from,
[15798] <prose> Consciousness suitable wisdom,
[15799] <prose> Not-suitable karma defilements become mount arise defect-not.
[15800] <prose> Second actions individual explain two:
[15801] <prose> Wisdom,
[15802] <prose> Karma wind actions.
[15803] <prose> First wisdom wind action wisdom four:
[15804] <prose> Wind located part-from basis-located wisdom work, || 30 ||
[15805] <prose> That done whatever-appear actual-state top-from other change not-possible.
[15806] <prose> Appearance part-from characteristic-hold wisdom,
[15807] <prose> That done individual family body wisdom light color clear pass not-possible.
[15808] <prose> Thus clear that attachment-not wisdom called.
[15809] <prose> Arise part-from knowables-gather wisdom,
[15810] <prose> That done self-other benefit obstruct-not.
[15811] <prose> That doing action doer own-continuum not-not.
[15812] <prose> Move part-from consciousness-gather wisdom, || 40 ||
[15813] <prose> That done worldly transcended knowledge distinction various arise,
[15814] <prose> That arise self self-possess grasp not.
[15815] <prose> Thus four definite cause time,
[15816] <prose> Path time ultimate elements four,
[15817] <prose> Fruition time four bodies essence ripen.
[15818] <prose> Thus basis path fruition three refer twelve arise,
[15819] <prose> Buddha activities twelve arise cause certain.
[15820] <prose> Second karma wind action four:
[15821] <prose> Right-from move male, || 50 ||
[15822] <prose> Left-from move female,
[15823] <prose> Outside go appearance various enter inside fill conceptual groups spread.
[15824] <prose> Right left time definite male female ripen father mother power.
[15825] <prose> Nature right-from move transfer work,
[15826] <prose> Karma end near,
[15827] <prose> Left-from move time grasp work.
[15828] <prose> Outside go inside fill go-come power:
[15829] <prose> Outside go happy work,
[15830] <prose> Inside come unhappy.
[15831] <prose> Those two wheel spread-gather vital-point day-night arise. || 60 ||
[15832] <prose> That outside go part-from day appearance arise,
[15833] <prose> Inside fill part-from night appearance arise.
[15834] <prose> Thus two four actions two-two counted eight become.
[15835] <prose> Those parts counted twenty-four located.
[15836] <prose> Karma wind difference twelve change actions twelve:
[15837] <prose> Body increase-decrease work.
[15838] <prose> That outside twelve,
[15839] <prose> Inside twelve months,
[15840] <prose> Secret twelve times arise.
[15841] <prose> Then karma wind samsara various work. || 70 ||
[15842] <prose> Third change amount:
[15843] <prose> Thus body ripen age prime bab one day-night about elements individual wind change amount:
[15844] <prose> Earth wind five-thousand four-hundred,
[15845] <prose> Water,
[15846] <prose> Fire,
[15847] <prose> Wind winds five-thousand four-hundred four-hundred combine,
[15848] <prose> Twenty-one-thousand six-hundred prime bab one change amount certain.
[15849] <prose> Youth teeth-two not-complete elements not-developed.
[15850] <prose> Wind element latency sleep life time calculate: || 80 ||
[15851] <prose> Wind transfer long life end bring,
[15852] <prose> Short not-bring.
[15853] <prose> Fierce merit enjoyment possess,
[15854] <prose> Attached disease certain suffering.
[15855] <prose> Slow samsara disease few,
[15856] <prose> Slow body weapons gather virtue mind not-arise.
[15857] <prose> Pressed constant non-virtue harm decrease located,
[15858] <prose> Agitated mind-agitated beings not-kind.
[15859] <prose> Also aged fifty-eight not-complete: || 90 ||
[15860] <prose> Element row damaged.
[15861] <prose> Very agitated life time quick,
[15862] <prose> Dull suffering sorrow lamentation engage,
[15863] <prose> Swirl mind actual-state not-reach non-virtue engage,
[15864] <prose> Slow life end extend constant bliss,
[15865] <prose> Khyig constant enemy dispute cause not-arise,
[15866] <prose> Khyog constant action happy life short,
[15867] <prose> Gyur enjoyment great disease certain,
[15868] <prose> Rgal body speech work not-accomplish,
[15869] <prose> Increase pacify-increase work quick accomplish. || 100 ||
[15870] <prose> Thus body enemy flourish constant suffering.
[15871] <prose> Gap good-bad show.
[15872] <prose> Prime age three-hundred not-complete year one life time,
[15873] <prose> Fifty not-complete year two,
[15874] <prose> Thirty-two not-complete year three,
[15875] <prose> Twenty-one not-complete year four,
[15876] <prose> One-eighth not-complete month seven,
[15877] <prose> One-sixth not-complete month five,
[15878] <prose> One-fourth not-complete month one one-tenth not-complete day twenty-nine,
[15879] <prose> Twenty not-complete eighteen, || 110 ||
[15880] <prose> Thirty not-complete ten,
[15881] <prose> Forty not-complete seven,
[15882] <prose> Sixty not-complete day five.
[15883] <prose> Thus wind calculation apply:
[15884] <prose> Worldly,
[15885] <prose> Transcended two.
[15886] <prose> Worldly life merit,
[15887] <prose> Bliss-suffering etc.
[15888] <prose> Transcended:
[15889] <prose> Change amount transfer time two.
[15890] <prose> Change amount:
[15891] <prose> Day aspect twelve change night aspect sixteen change.
[15892] <prose> Day elements individual action bliss-suffering virtuous-non-virtuous conceptual groups horses move.
[15893] <prose> Night also those same,
[15894] <prose> Wisdom wind increase doing.
[15895] <prose> Transfer time explained.
[15896] <prose> Third meaning: located bindu detailed distinction. || 130 ||
[15897] <tantra> Thalgyur-from:
[15898] <verse> "Bindu Dharmata wish show,
[15899] <verse> Ultimate and relative-from,
[15900] <verse> First relative bindu-to,

[15924] <prose> Effort-not elaboration free system two.
[15925] <prose> Elaboration artifice channel wind coarse effort path,
[15926] <prose> First relative bindu yoga,

[15939] <prose> After experience examine,
[15940] <prose> Body mind reverse experience etc. above third empowerment occasion detailed elaborated.
[15941] <prose> That karma wind time bindu hold,
[15942] <prose> Wisdom time bindu reverse potential bestow vital-point correct.
[15943] <prose> Elaboration-not yogi,
