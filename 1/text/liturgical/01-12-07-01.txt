[15778] First:

[15779] That also vein from move only, one from
[15780] Karma and wisdom two each change, what?
[15781] Or move not-same two appropriate,
[15782] One if two not-suit,
[15783] Move only one by-means-of
[15784] Samsara-nirvana any one from not-appropriate, thus.

[15785] Answer: move only one also, vein twist possess change from wisdom wind go,
[15786] Action bliss power and
[15787] Empty and
[15788] Clear empty by-means-of wisdom wind called.

[15789] Vein location change twist from karma wind go,
[15790] Action thought various and non-virtuous connection various and
[15791] Unclear and
[15792] Dull and
[15793] Agitated and
[15794] Torpid and
[15795] Coiled etc. wind defect bad arise.

[15796] Example: Bhara son one actually anger tiger change,
[15797] Not anger man come like,
[15798] Awareness resonance and body vein from move wind only one also,
[15799] Vein twist not-twist from
[15800] Consciousness work suitable wisdom and
[15801] Not suitable from karma defilements change arise,
[15802] Defect not-exist.

[15803] Second, action each explain, two:
[15804] Wisdom and
[15805] Karma wind action so.

[15806] First, wisdom wind action, wisdom four:
[15807] Wind that located part from basis-stay wisdom work,
[15808] That do whatever appear actual-state top from
[15809] Other change not possible.
[15810] That appearance part from characteristic hold wisdom,
[15811] That do each family and body and wisdom and light and color clear from pass not possible.
[15812] Thus clear also that attachment not-exist, wisdom called.
[15813] That arise part from knowable gather wisdom,
[15814] That do self other benefit obstacle not-exist.
[15815] That do also do and do-er self-continuum not.
[15816] Move part from consciousness gather wisdom,
[15817] That do worldly and transcended knowledge difference various arise,
[15818] That arise also self and self-possess hold not.

[15819] Thus four certainty: cause time,
[15820] Path time ultimate element four make,
[15821] Result time body four essence ripen.
[15822] Thus basis path result three refer, twelve arise,
[15823] Buddha activity twelve come cause certain.

[15824] Second, karma wind work four:
[15825] Right from move male,
[15826] Left from move female,
[15827] Outside come appearance various enter, inside fill, thought-groups various spread.
[15828] Right left time certainty from male and female ripen: father and mother power.
[15829] Nature right from move: transfer work and
[15830] Karma end near.
[15831] Outside go and inside fill: go-come power,
[15832] Outside go happy work,
[15833] Inside come not-happy.
[15834] That two wheel spread-gather point from day-night arise.
[15835] That also outside go part from day appearance arise,
[15836] Inside fill part from night appearance arise.
[15837] Thus two work four two-two count, eight become.
[15838] That also part count, twenty four located.

[15839] Karma wind difference from twelve: change action twelve,
[15840] 
[15841] Body increase-decrease work.
[15842] That by-means-of outside year twelve,
[15843] Inside month twelve,
[15844] Secret time twelve arise.

[15845] Then samsara work various karma wind do.

[15846] Third, change amount:
[15847] Thus body ripen, age prime bab one, day-night about one,
[15848] Element four each wind change amount:
[15849] Earth wind: thousand five and four-hundred,
[15850] Water and
[15851] Fire and
[15852] Wind winds: also five-thousand four-hundred four-hundred, gather,
[15853] Twenty-thousand one-thousand six-hundred: prime bab one change amount certainty.

[15854] Youth teeth two not-complete: element not-develop.
[15855] Wind element predisposition sleep life time calculate,
[15856] Wind transfer long: life end bring,
[15857] Short: not bring.

[15858] Fierce: merit and enjoyment possess,
[15859] Attachment: disease certainly suffering.
[15860] Slow: samsara disease few,
[15861] Slow: body weapon gather, virtuous mind not arise.
[15862] Press: constant not-virtuous and harm decrease located,
[15863] Agitated: mind-agitated and beings not kind.

[15864] Also aged fifty eight not-complete:
[15865] Element rank damage,
[15866] This very agitated: life time quick,
[15867] Dull: suffering and sorrow and lamentation engage,
[15868] Swirl: mind actual-state not reach, non-virtuous engage,
[15869] Slow: life end extend and constant bliss,
[15870] Khyig: constant enemy and dispute cause not arise,
[15871] Khyog: constant action happy and life short,
[15872] Gyur: enjoyment great and disease certainly,
[15873] Rgal: body speech work not accomplish,
[15874] Increase: pacify-increase work quick accomplish.

[15875] Thus section seven complete.

[15876] Thus chapter twelve complete.
