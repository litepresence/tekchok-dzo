[18610] <tantra>From the Thalgyur Tantra:</tantra>
[18611] Furthermore, the wisdom of appearance is taught.
[18612] <verse>From earth, water, fire, wind, and space,
[18613] Wisdom-appearance wondrously arises.
[18614] Thus the Bhagavan, unexcelled Lord, transcends contact.</verse>
[18615] Thus it is spoken.
[18616] <verse>From within emptiness itself,
[18617] Wisdom sought by analysis is not found.
[18618] From severing the concepts of the three realms,
[18619] The five doors' fixation-stream is cut.</verse>
[18620] <verse>Moon and jewel, lapis lazuli light—
[18621] Whatever one desires to emanate,
[18622] Seize the appearance of the emanation body arisen from grasping.
[18623] Or else, from knowing the essential point
[18624] Of great perfection, wisdom itself
[18625] Free from activity, like space,
[18626] Transcends conceptual elaboration and reference.
[18627] Wondrous, marvelous wisdom—
[18628] Not before, not after, not primordially existent.
[18629] Now transcending the objects of conceptual mind,
[18630] The nature free from extremes, emptiness itself.
[18631] Beyond words, free from intellect, empty of essence.
[18632] Since nature is not divided anywhere,
[18633] Compassionate activity does not appear.</verse>
[18634] <verse>From the threefold wisdom-appearance,
[18635] Mind-arising, insight, and delusion-appearances are held.
[18636] This has no object of observation, no extreme.
[18637] From the marvelous play of neither existence nor non-existence,
[18638] Buddhas attain the result.
[18639] Externally and internally, all is dharmadhatu.
[18640] Here nothing whatsoever appears.</verse>
[18641] Thus it is spoken.
[18642] Third, the wisdom of objects: when form and the other five objects are self-liberated,
[18643] The nature of the four appearances progressively increases.
[18644] Again, from that very source:
[18645] <tantra>Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught.</tantra>
[18646] <verse>From the varieties of form and sound,
[18647] The experiences to be trained become fivefold.
[18648] The experience of consciousness exhausted is appearance,
[18649] Waxing like the moon's bright fortnight.
[18650] Each appearance has its own experience.</verse>
[18651] <tantra>Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught.</tantra>
[18652] <verse>From warmth, measure, and signs,
[18653] The two truths inseparably joined, concept-extremes exhausted.
[18654] Without action, characteristics are empty.
[18655] Since the basis of expression ceases, extremes do not dwell.
[18656] Since outflows are exhausted, there is no clinging.
[18657] The source of memory cut, essence clear.
[18658] Clear awareness does not conceive objects' extremes.
[18659] Since it is free from sound, genuine, without words,
[18660] All reference points are exhausted.</verse>
[18661] Thus it is spoken.
[18662] The fourth topic has two aspects regarding individual meanings:
[18663] Brief presentation and
[18664] Detailed explanation.
[18665] First, the Sugata-essence, the naturally spontaneously present Buddha of the nature of reality, great wisdom of meaning, pervades all sentient beings without addition or subtraction, great or small, good or bad.
[18666] From the common scripture, the Tathagatagarbha Sutra:
[18667] "Within the bodies of all sentient beings, the Tathagatagarbha dwells as it was primordially."
[18668] From the Uttaratantra:
[18669] <verse>Since the Buddha-body radiates,
[18670] Since suchness is without division,
[18671] Since the potential exists,
[18672] All embodied beings always possess the Buddha-essence.</verse>
[18673] Thus it is spoken.
[18674] From the uncommon scripture, the Tregchö:
[18675] <verse>Sentient beings themselves are Buddhas.
[18676] However, they are obscured by adventitious defilements.</verse>
[18677] And from the Doha:
[18678] <verse>Through explaining treatises, all scholars
[18679] Do not realize Buddha exists within.</verse>
[18680] Thus it is spoken.
[18681] From the unsurpassed scripture,
[18682] The Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror Tantra, the Secret One:
[18683] "Within all sentient beings of the world-systems,
[18684] The Tathagatagarbha dwells like sesame pervaded by oil."
[18685] If one thinks that since it dwells thus, it should be visible to direct sight,
[18686] The body's appearance together with light is obscured by clinging, not found in the field of vision.
[18687] Yet now, like the sun example, dwelling within the body's cloud-mass,
[18688] When pointed out directly through the meaning,
[18689] The sign of the bindu, the lamp of emptiness, is shown—faith arises.
[18690] The speech is obscured by words;
[18691] The mind is obscured by conceptual mind, thus not seen.
[18692] The person of diligence who meditates on the four appearances as the measure, exists as it is now,
[18693] In the bardo, self-appearance pure, as it exists, will dawn.
[18694] Now it is like a garuda egg wrapped around—obscured by the growth of habitual patterns.
[18695] From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Tantra:
[18696] <verse>Within the self-body of all sentient beings,
[18697] The appearance of pure wisdom dwells.
[18698] Unable to manifest vastly,
[18699] Like the womb and the egg's shell—
[18700] Not emerging directly, though obscured,
[18701] When own-potency is perfected, it emerges.
[18702] When this conceptual body is abandoned,
[18703] Self-appearance and objects will meet.
[18704] Awareness itself, dwelling primordially,
[18705] Will be seen as essence without concept.
[18706] The appearance of pure wisdom
[18707] And Buddha-truth will be seen.
[18708] The essence of self-appearance, wisdom itself,
[18709] Is without conceptual mind.
[18710] Past objects and future objects—
[18711] Appearance is cut through directly.
[18712] The self-appearance of great wisdom,
[18713] Though not an immediate object,
[18714] Is shown by the self-arisen lamp.
[18715] That very lamp's wisdom
[18716] Transcends the extremes of appearance and non-appearance.</verse>
[18717] Thus it is spoken.
[18718] Furthermore, that great wisdom dwells in the heart-center, the pure light-channel, the celestial palace, as essence-body, with the complete marks and signs of the five lights.
[18719] Since its nature dwells as light, wisdom's appearance is measureless.
[18720] Since compassion and awareness dwell, knowledge is internally clear.
[18721] From that, resonating in the conch-shell chamber, the completely perfect great mandala of wrathful ones abides.
[18722] Light,
[18723] Rays,
[18724] Bindus,
[18725] And subtle bindus—the resonance of appearance's nature, like the four great channels branching from the heart's light-channel, dwells naturally,
[18726] And in the eyes dwells as four lamps.
[18727] That too: in the citta is the body;
[18728] In the four channels, bindus;
[18729] In the conch-chamber, light-rays;
[18730] In the eyes, Briguta—the appearance of Vajra Lougyu dwells.
[18731] From Senge Tsal Dzogchen:
[18732] <verse>Ema! The wisdom of awareness itself
[18733] Dwells unchangingly within all Buddhas and sentient beings.
[18734] That nature of reality is as follows:
[18735] The citta, the jewel-celestial palace;
[18736] The jewel-channel's celestial palace;
[18737] The pure conch-chamber celestial palace;
[18738] The Briguta celestial palace;
[18739] Within these great celestial palaces,
[18740] The essence of awareness appears as potency.</verse>
[18741] That too is explained as follows:
[18742] <verse>Some dwell as bodies;
[18743] Some are bindus;
[18744] One dwells as light-ray manner;
[18745] From one, Lougyu emerges.
[18746] Thus the dwelling-place is taught.
[18747] The meaning of Buddha primordially dwelling,
[18748] Dwelling within all sentient beings,
[18749] The Victorious Ones excellently explained.</verse>
[18750] Thus it is spoken.
[18751] Furthermore, body and Lougyu,
[18752] Dhatu and wisdom's meaning:
[18753] From that very source:
[18754] <verse>Awareness and non-awareness, appearance itself,
[18755] Transcends the extremes of actor and action.
[18756] Vastness itself radiates like a body;
[18757] Clarity itself arises like light;
[18758] Emptiness itself spreads like rays.
[18759] Buddha and sentient being—
[18760] Not separate awareness,
[18761] But taught as separate appearances.</verse>
[18762] <verse>The characteristics of the body are as follows:
[18763] Unchanging, clear,
[18764] Empty, and free from concept.
[18765] The characteristics of awareness are as follows:
[18766] Subtle, radiating,
[18767] Lougyu, and moving.
[18768] The characteristics of dhatu are as follows:
[18769] Vast, spontaneously thick, emptiness without limit,
[18770] Clear, warm, and cool,
[18771] Holding light-flexible essence,
[18772] Pervading, encircling, and encompassing.</verse>
[18773] <verse>The characteristics of wisdom are as follows:
[18774] Arising, entering, self-clear,
[18775] Primordial, knowing, realized.
[18776] Clear, radiant, and infinitely vast,
[18777] Appearance, darkness, and revealing,
[18778] Emptiness and clear wisdom supreme—
[18779] These are held as mantra characteristics.</verse>
[18780] Thus it is spoken.
[18781] That too: in the heart is the body;
[18782] In the conch-mouth, wisdom;
[18783] In Briguta, awareness;
[18784] In the four channels, the appearance of dharmadhatu light and bindus dawn.
[18785] The four channels, from self-arising:
[18786] <verse>The pure white, smooth, empty channel;
[18787] The channels of jewel-radiance;
[18788] The great liberating channel;
[18789] The white crystal moving channel—
[18790] From these, consciousness mounted on wind
[18791] Enters through Briguta's great door,
[18792] Dissolving into the arising-path emptiness.
[18793] Without what dissolves, clarity like a vase,
[18794] The five-fold bindu, wisdom perfected.</verse>
[18795] Thus it is spoken.
[18796] That wisdom, self-abiding in the heart's great channel, clear resonance, abiding in its own light, wisdom's self-resonance,
[18797] Is supported by the four channels' five wisdoms' self-resonance, maturing into the four lamps within cakṣu as the wisdom bindu, the lamp of emptiness, and the lamp of pure dharmadhatu,
[18798] And as measureless wisdom, the lasso-water lamp and self-arisen wisdom lamp, from the Thalgyur:
[18799] <tantra>Within the time of the body, as follows:</tantra>
[18800] <verse>In the assembled elements, the aggregates,
[18801] Within the citta, the jewel-celestial palace,
[18802] The essence, pure from the letter KA,
[18803] Emptiness-clarity gathered, body's resonance,
[18804] Complete face and hands, vase-body manner,
[18805] Spontaneously present as light-mass,
[18806] Compassion individually clear in colors.
[18807] Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma,
[18808] Katishel, having the tube—
[18809] Mirror-like, equality, discriminating,
[18810] All-accomplishing, dharmadhatu wisdom:
[18811] Bindus moving and non-moving,
[18812] Abiding as supports of perfected own-potency.
[18813] From the gathered pure essence of both eyes,
[18814] Through method and wisdom's distinction,
[18815] The bindu of knowing the nature of reality,
[18816] And the lamp of pure dharmadhatu mature.
[18817] Measureless, the lasso and
[18818] Wisdom lamp mature,
[18819] Thus the karma of sentient beings,
[18820] And faculties' distinctions as they are,
[18821] Through training in these, one will know.</verse>
[18822] Thus it is spoken.
[18823] Second, detailed explanation has two aspects:
[18824] General indication of the object of knowledge,
[18825] And detailed explanation of the object to be adopted.
[18826] First, from eight aspects:
[18827] The support is the form aggregate, the upper body.
[18828] The location is the heart jewel, eight-cornered, center of the pure light-channel, where the peaceful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells with awareness.
[18829] The path proceeds from the four channels.
[18830] The door is the two eyes.
[18831] The resonance is two lamps—like a peacock's and like the syllable HA.
[18832] The object is space free from clouds, dharmatā emptiness without thought or conceptualization.
[18833] The time is this very moment or when bardo appearance dawns.
[18834] The destination is the eight dawning-doors of spontaneous presence: those who recognize go to liberation in the dhatu; those who don't recognize wander in samsara—like the four path-forks.
[18835] The liberation-place is the appearance of original purity.
[18836] Thus also from Rangshar:
[18837] <tantra>Kye, companions, listen!</tantra>
[18838] The suchness of all dharmas should be indicated by examples.
[18839] The intent of the perfectly complete Buddha is:
[18840] The support relies on the form aggregate.
[18841] Example: like sleeping in a bird's nest.
[18842] The location dwells in the heart—example: like a vase-body.
[18843] The path emerges from the four channels—example: like a pearl rosary strung.
[18844] It coils within the white conch-chamber—example: like a lamp placed inside a vase.
[18845] The door emerges from the eyes—example: like star-light.
[18846] The lamp of empty bindu—example: like a peacock's eye.
[18847] The lamp of dhatu-awareness—example: like the syllable NA RO.
[18848] The object is empty space.
[18849] The time is bardo appearance—example: like a mirror mandala.
[18850] The destination is the jewel body—example: like a rock-path.
[18851] The liberation-place is the appearance of original purity—example: like a vase-body.</tantra>
[18852] And from Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror:
[18853] <tantra>Aho! Listen, great expanse-children!</tantra>
[18854] Within all sentient beings of the world-systems,
[18855] The Tathagatagarbha dwells like sesame seeds pervaded by oil.
[18856] That too: the support relies on the form aggregate.
[18857] The location dwells in the heart-center: Samantabhadra, called "cuckoo beak-sealed intention," dwells within like a cuckoo's sealed beak. Within, in the five-colored light center, the peaceful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells in the manner of light-mansion.
[18858] That is the location of awareness.
[18859] Example: like a vase-body.
[18860] The wisdom arising from that dwells in the head, the conch-chamber.
[18861] That too, the wrathful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells at the distance of drawn bow-string.
[18862] That too dwells as light-ray manner.
[18863] The light arising from that is clear like a mirror mandala, pure, or dwells as light-rays like a fish-eye.
[18864] The connection of that with awareness is: from the heart's tip, the white silk-thread channel upward, mere as a silk-leaf, passing through the throat, exists there. From there the path emerges and enters inside the head.
[18865] That channel too, from the small tip, right and left, emerges and connects to the head.
[18866] That too emerges from the right and left ear-flaps and connects to the eyes.
[18867] From there, turning the eyes to space, twisting the channel, looking, wisdom's light-appearance will fill space.
[18868] That too: from the heart-center's light-channel, the golden great channel Katishel branches, the upward tip white silk-leaf channel, from the heart-tip passing through the throat, from the ear branches three to the two eyes' door, pierces.
[18869] The central one pierces Brahma's aperture.
[18870] In the subtle, the coils are the centers of the four chakras, each connected from the heart.
[18871] The crystal-apertured one dwells with the resonance of the five clear-light winds at the life-force channel.
[18872] Second, detailed explanation of the wisdom object to be adopted has three aspects:
[18873] The support, channels, to be purified;
[18874] The doors of arising, the lamps to be held;
[18875] The resonance of appearance, clear light to be shown.
[18876] First, since wisdom dwells in the body, introducing it to the path through two essential points:
[18877] The general essential point: directing wind-mind to the lamp AH, exhausting dharmadhatu-awareness' increase-decrease, from the Thalgyur:
[18878] <verse>Self-knowing wisdom dwells in the body,
[18879] Like oil within sesame seeds.
[18880] The body's radiance and splendor
[18881] Wisdom moistens, pervading.
[18882] Through corresponding with body, the bodies,
[18883] Wisdom's light-aura, colors, and signs.
[18884] Through karma, entering, and bodies,
[18885] Resonance and all pervading.
[18886] Insight itself and the lamp's function—
[18887] Ultimate and relative signs distinguished.
[18888] Maturing: each bindu's essential point;
[18889] Transforming: concept, coarse grasping.
[18890] Wisdom-appearance, four, two aspects,
[18891] From arising-entering's distinction.
[18892] In the citta, jewel-celestial palace,
[18893] Jewel-gathered, eight-cornered, doored,
[18894] Five wisdoms and five bodies,
[18895] Wind and knowledge's potency also five.
[18896] All are five-five's nature.
[18897] The body's essential point is through resonance.
[18898] Wisdom's posture through purity.
[18899] Lifting and stirring bindus accomplishes.
[18900] Light extending and gathering.
[18901] Connected meditation is wind's essential point.
[18902] The entering function distinguishes extremes.
[18903] Its transforming causes wind exhaustion.
[18904] Delusion's concordance to be joined.
[18905] Awareness' essential point is releasing,
[18906] Lifting and directing to space.
[18907] Dhatu's essential point is gathering,
[18908] Drawing and pervading elements.
[18909] Appearance's essential point: increase and exhaustion,
[18910] Various, self-liberated in their own place.</verse>
[18911] Thus it is spoken.
[18912] The specific essential point: pressing the essential points of four chakras and three main channels, introducing wind-mind into wisdom's network, from that very source:
[18913] <verse>Awareness-wisdom's path itself,
[18914] Within one's own channel-chakra,
[18915] Where body-speech self-perfectly dwells,
[18916] Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma,
[18917] The three mothers hold the body,
[18918] The central supports four chakras.
[18919] These dwelling right, left, center,
[18920] Through relative-ultimate distinction,
[18921] Generate body and limbs,
[18922] And mature the lamp itself.
[18923] Roma circulates tastes in the chakra,
[18924] Wind urges, bindus emanate.
[18925] Since taste relies on channels,
[18926] Bliss expands body and mind.
[18927] MA gathers the pure essence,
[18928] Establishes base of upper-lower locations.
[18929] Lifting and pressing in this is essential.
[18930] In this's six branches,
[18931] Burning and incinerating, wisdom ceases.
[18932] If desiring warmth-attainment, pressing is essential.
[18933] Wind and bindu should be drawn.
[18934] Kyangma generates in the chakra,
[18935] Wind emanates, gathers, bindus enter.
[18936] "Kyang" means peerless,
[18937] Revealing unique intention.
[18938] MA clears the old,
[18939] Generates essence-splendor.
[18940] In this, opening and pressing is essential.
[18941] In this, the branch not appearing,
[18942] Place bindus in the four corners.
[18943] Desiring food-control,
[18944] Press wind, don't expel water.
[18945] Through samaya, examine channels.
[18946] Kundarma is mindfulness,
[18947] Gathering the tip-chakra matures.
[18948] Reversing karma-wind, holds wisdom.
[18949] "Kun" gives emanation body qualities.
[18950] Shaking is enjoyment body qualities.
[18951] MA actually shows dharmakaya.
[18952] In this's twelve branches,
[18953] Opening and twisting is essential.
[18954] Extending life, rely on applying.
[18955] Bindus, through body and mind.
[18956] From this wisdom-path,
[18957] Bindus and body are obtained.
[18958] Wind performs all going-coming actions.
[18959] Mind's lord held by mentation.
[18960] Path-held and drawn.</verse>
[18961] Thus it is spoken.
[18962] Second, holding the doors of arising, the lamps, has two aspects: door and lamp.
[18963] The door's essential point: the channel connecting heart to head, the faults and qualities of the sense-faculties' clarifier, has five branches in the eye. From the center of the deer-horn-like channel's coils, from the light-channel, wisdom actually emerges. Looking unwaveringly into space's expanse is the true essential point, from the Thalgyur:
[18964] <verse>The door of wisdom's arising itself,
[18965] All body-essence, pure gathering,
[18966] Emerging from the door called cakṣu,
[18967] Holding both aspects, showing appearance.
[18968] Arising from connected generating channels.
[18969] From the tip becoming one,
[18970] Dawning for faculties' objects,
[18971] In one having five branches,
[18972] Appearing in each faculty's door.
[18973] Particularly distinguishing faults and qualities,
[18974] From deer-horn-like coils,
[18975] "A-bré" called, half white-black,
[18976] Knowing and holding forms,
[18977] Perfectly showing knowledge's own-potency.
[18978] In this, wisdom actually emerges,
[18979] Directly and through self-essential point,
[18980] The pure dharmatā self-appearance object,
[18981] Abiding with concept ceasing.</verse>
[18982] Thus it is spoken.
[18983] The lamp's essential point: through gaze-binding and gazing-binding, pressing, directing, leading, and training in sun-moon support, from that very source:
[18984] <verse>From ultimate dharmatā arising,
[18985] Lamps are of four types:
[18986] Maturing, entering, pervading-emptiness,
[18987] Gathering dharmatā's object-appearance.
[18988] From the lasso, forms are gathered,
[18989] Wind cuts and emanates.
[18990] Through coming-going's increase-decrease,
[18991] Pure wisdom is gathered.
[18992] The empty bindu performs all actions.
[18993] Holding the past path's aspect,
[18994] Wind generates radiance and splendor.
[18995] Transforming, showing wisdom-appearance.
[18996] Through self-arisen wisdom lamp,
[18997] All dharmas equally, one taste,
[18998] Gathered, holding self-appearance.
[18999] This cuts habitual pattern connections.
[19000] Dhatu gathers pure essence,
[19001] Awareness holds the bodies,
[19002] Through three essential points maturing essence,
[19003] Samsara is abandoned.
[19004] Thus from the eye, lamp arising,
[19005] Buddha-intention's essential points gathered,
[19006] Holding self-appearance objects.
[19007] The lamp's essential point I explain—
[19008] Deva-son of good fortune, you listen!
[19009] Through objects, awareness, and wind,
[19010] In order to hold dharmatā as path,
[19011] Through perfected wisdom,
[19012] This too is the lamp's essential point.
[19013] Lasso unmoving is essential.
[19014] At this time, join with three gazes.
[19015] Wisdom lamp training's essential point—
[19016] Three rituals extending,
[19017] Through accomplishing essential point, generate expanse.
[19018] Bindu-lamp pressing is essential.
[19019] Through not separating channel and thumb-finger,
[19020] Wisdom increases upward.
[19021] Dhatu's essential point is leading.
[19022] Yogins, properly join sun-training methods,
[19023] Lead well.
[19024] Train also in moon.
[19025] Whoever does this continuously,
[19026] Delusion-appearance-stream ceases.
[19027] Five pure wisdoms' light,
[19028] Through emptying earth, stone, rock-mountain,
[19029] Ship-broken or mere land-island—
[19030] Those skilled in leading will see.
[19031] At this time, method-adjustment is essential.
[19032] Through perfection, dharmatā is obtained.
[19033] Thus through habituation, dharmatā's power,
[19034] Body-arising self-perfects in its own place.
[19035] Thus through body-arising stream-ceasing,
[19036] Outflow-aggregates become invisible,
[19037] In this, perfect buddhahood.</verse>
[19038] Thus it is spoken.
[19039] Third, showing the resonance of appearance, clear light, has five aspects:
[19040] Body,
[19041] Wisdom,
[19042] Light,
[19043] Bindu,
[19044] And detailed explanation of awareness' nature.
[19045] First has two aspects: brief presentation and detailed explanation.
[19046] First, from the Thalgyur:
[19047] <verse>Within the citta, body dwells as body.
[19048] Resonance-body through five aspects
[19049] Holds each family's characteristics.
[19050] Ray-body through six also
[19051] Gathers nature-appearance's dharmatā.
[19052] Pure body through three
[19053] Holds nirvana's indication.
[19054] Aspect-body through eight also
[19055] Performs complete stage-path actions.</verse>
[19056] Thus it is spoken.
[19057] Since citta's essence dwells as body's arising-base, when that resonance, the five families' bodies unmixed, measure dawns, appearance dawns.
[19058] From the body, rays emanate; within channels, bindus ray-resonance, external expansion, and appearance's subtle body, six aspects appear.
[19059] The wisdom three liberated, body's liberation-place, holding the measure of internal dhatu exhaustion.
[19060] The eight aspect-bodies are at the completion-stage, spontaneously present ground, from dividing three bodies into nine;
[19061] Dharmakaya's dharmakaya, pure dharmadhatu, all's arising-base, established as base, not counted separately, thus eight.
[19062] Second, detailed explanation of body has two aspects:
[19063] Common distinctions and
[19064] Distinct distinctions, detailed explanation.
[19065] First has two aspects:
[19066] Awareness object-appearance's body and
[19067] Pure essence gathered body, from Sun-Moon Seal:
[19068] <tantra>Body is twofold: awareness object-appearance's body
[19069] And pure essences gathered body.</tantra>
[19070] First, appearing to faculties, without negation or proof;
[19071] Distinguishing: faculties,
[19072] Aggregates,
[19073] Objects and subjects, pure body, and three, from that very source:
[19074] <tantra>The body appearing to awareness-objects is the great body of faculties purified,
[19075] The great body of aggregates purified,
[19076] The great body of dhātus and āyatanas, objects and subjects, and afflictions purified.</tantra>
[19077] Second, the pure essence gathered body appears to those habituated into power:
[19078] Distinguishing: the body holding the unmistaken path's own-characteristics,
[19079] And the body unchanging in color-light characteristics, as-it-is, from these two, first:
[19080] <verse>Through essence, nature, compassion three,
[19081] Holding path's characteristics,
[19082] Causing result to reach measure,
[19083] Great Play body and
[19084] Great General body and
[19085] Family-sustaining body are renowned.</verse>
[19086] From Sun-Moon Seal:
[19087] <tantra>The body holding own-characteristics is as follows:
[19088] Non-dividing Great Play body,
[19089] Supreme Great General body,
[19090] And family-sustaining body.</tantra>
[19091] Second, the as-it-is body has three aspects: base, path, and result.
[19092] The body dwelling in base self-arisen wisdom,
[19093] The body unchanging from external appearance of light-resonance dhatu-body primeval,
[19094] The three bodies spontaneously present dhatu-exhausted destination reached, from that very source:
[19095] <tantra>The as-it-is body is as follows:
[19096] Primordially abiding first body,
[19097] Primeval unchanging body,
[19098] And result self-perfecting body.</tantra>
[19099] The result self-perfecting body is threefold:
[19100] <tantra>Dharmakaya without elaboration great,
[19101] Saṃbhogakaya without grasping great,
[19102] And Nirmāṇakaya without self great.</tantra>
[19103] Second, distinct distinctions' detailed explanation has two aspects: essence brief presentation and
[19104] Detailed explanation.
[19105] First, from Rangshar:
[19106] <tantra>What is body? The base awareness body,
[19107] Vast dharmatā body,
[19108] Expanded dhatu body,
[19109] Unchanging essence body,
[19110] Pure bliss body,
[19111] Erroneous mind body,
[19112] Seeing self-liberated body,
[19113] One bindu body,
[19114] Unbroken space body,
[19115] Non-falling directions sun-moon body,
[19116] Non-dual other body,
[19117] And attachment-free self-liberated body.</tantra>
[19118] Second:
[19119] What are the characteristics of these thirteen bodies? Explained from that very source:
[19120] <tantra>That is as follows:
[19121] The base awareness body is Vajra Lougyu's body. It is clear to one's unceased eye-faculty.
[19122] That is called the base awareness body.
[19123] The vast dharmatā body is the original base, original purity great, from which there is no thought.
[19124] No non-awareness.
[19125] No mind.
[19126] No mentation.
[19127] No grasping.
[19128] That is as follows:
[19129] Unbroken wisdom,
[19130] Spontaneously accomplished Buddha,
[19131] Elaboration-free dharmatā,
[19132] Extreme-free awareness,
[19133] Great pure appearance,
[19134] Non-fallen-direction view abides.
[19135] That is vast,
[19136] Clear,
[19137] Unchanging,
[19138] Wisdom unceasing,
[19139] Bindu variously radiating,
[19140] Unchanging dharmatā,
[19141] External unbroken,
[19142] Internal five wisdom-lights unceasingly clear,
[19143] Abiding as body and wisdom's essence.
[19144] That is called the vast dharmatā body.
[19145] The expanded dhatu body is the pure dharmadhatu lamp.
[19146] That dhatu too is unbroken,
[19147] Non-fallen in directions,
[19148] Without decrease,
[19149] Without increase,
[19150] Without emptying,
[19151] Without filling,
[19152] With clear aspect,
[19153] The location where many bodies arise,
[19154] Vast, all's essence,
[19155] Extremely great, none above,
[19156] Buddha of view-seeing,
[19157] Called the ground of definite attainment.
[19158] That is called the expanded dhatu body.
[19159] The unchanging vajra body is: Buddha without Buddha result,
[19160] Samsara without sentient beings,
[19161] Buddha with life severed,
[19162] Arising without making,
[19163] Object unseen, unexperienced,
[19164] Speech unexperienced, unknown,
[19165] Body unexperienced, untaken,
[19166] Virtue with life severed,
[19167] Deity without accomplishment,
[19168] Essence uncounted,
[19169] Meditation without meditating,
[19170] Mandala without drawing,
[19171] Collections without accumulating.
[19172] That is the unchanging vajra body.
[19173] The unchanging essence body is: tenet unchanging,

[19175] Characteristics non-dual,
[19176] View seeing directions,

[19181] Play without ceasing,
[19182] Essence good-thal,

[19193] Nirmāṇakaya all-pervading,
[19194] Five lights location-pervading.
[19195] That is the pure bliss body.
[19196] The erroneous mind body is: variously arising,
[19197] Variously gathering,
[19198] All's path,
[19199] All's location,
[19200] All's base,
[19201] Samsara self-place.
[19202] That is the erroneous mind body.
[19203] The seeing self-liberated body is: unchanging yet changing,
[19204] Changing yet unchanging,
[19205] Body without life-force,
[19206] Sentient being without mind,
[19207] Changing without breath,
[19208] Buddha without going-coming,
[19209] All-times wisdom,
[19210] Dharmatā always abiding,
[19211] Self-liberated without grasping,
[19212] Body five without concept,
[19213] Wisdom unceased seeing,
[19214] Dharmatā self-liberated in own place.
[19215] That is the seeing self-liberated body.
[19216] The one bindu body is:
[19217] All-pervading arising wisdom,
[19218] All-pervading appearance wisdom,
[19219] All-pervading arising wisdom,
[19220] All-pervading clear wisdom,
[19221] All-pervading depth-clear wisdom,
[19222] All-pervading sky-clear wisdom,
[19223] All-pervading self-arisen wisdom.
[19224] That is the one bindu body.
[19225] The unbroken space body is: appearance and wisdom unbroken,
[19226] Space and dhatu unbroken,
[19227] Sentient beings and Buddhas unbroken,
[19228] Elements and light-appearance unbroken,
[19229] Seeing and self-body unbroken,
[19230] Emptiness and dharmatā unbroken,

[19236] Non-awareness and awareness unbroken,
[19237] Non-awareness and awareness unbroken,
[19238] Emptiness and clarity unbroken.
[19239] That is called the unbroken space body.
[19240] The non-fallen-directions sun-moon body is: grasping-free self-liberated, concept-free self-Buddha,
[19241] Unchanging self-pure,
[19242] Unclear radiance,
[19243] Meditation-free dharmatā,
[19244] Ungraspable vastness,
[19245] Sentient beings without Buddha.
[19246] That is the non-fallen-directions sun-moon body.
[19247] The non-dual other body is: lamp sky-pervading,
[19248] Wisdom dhatu-pervading,
[19249] Insight object-pervading,
[19250] Method path-pervading,
[19251] Faculties mind-pervading.
[19252] That is the non-dual lamp body.
[19253] The attachment-free self-liberated body is:
[19254] Not attached to appearance,
[19255] Not clinging to emptiness,
[19256] Not establishing non-existence,
[19257] Not rejecting existence,
[19258] Not desiring non-existence,
[19259] Not fixated on existence,
[19260] Not establishing what is done,
[19261] Not blocking what arises,
[19262] Not seeing faults in what arises,
[19263] Not considering virtues in what doesn't arise,
[19264] Not abandoning afflictions,
[19265] Not establishing Buddhas,
[19266] Not meditating meditation,
[19267] Not viewing view,
[19268] Not ceasing delusion-appearance,
[19269] Not seeking pure appearance,
[19270] Not hoping for Buddha in mind,
[19271] Not doubting sentient beings in awareness,
[19272] Not hoping for dharmakaya in all-ground,
[19273] Not doubting form-body in lamp,
[19274] Nothing to purify in path,
[19275] Nothing to obtain in result,
[19276] No good-bad in base,
[19277] Realized and unrealized non-dual.</tantra>
[19278] That is called the attachment-free self-liberated body.
[19279] Thus it is spoken.
[19280] If these were explained in detail, they are clear, measureless, therefore elaboration ceases.
[19281] Second, detailed explanation of wisdom's nature has two aspects:
[19282] Base-dwelling wisdom and
[19283] Characteristic-holding wisdom.
[19284] First, from essence, nature, compassion three:
[19285] Essence appears as body;
[19286] Nature appears as light;
[19287] Compassion's activity appears as enlightened activity.
[19288] Thus also from Sun-Moon Seal:
[19289] <tantra>Base-dwelling wisdom is threefold: essence original purity wisdom,
[19290] Nature spontaneously present wisdom,
[19291] And compassion self-appearance wisdom.</tantra>
[19292] Second, the five characteristic-holding wisdoms:
[19293] Since dhatu exists in body, from its potency arises, from Rangshar:
[19294] <verse>From unchanging body, unceasing wisdom arises.
[19295] That is as follows:
[19296] Since dhatu exists in body,
[19297] Dharmadhatu wisdom arises.
[19298] Since clarity-aspect exists in dhatu,
[19299] Mirror-like wisdom arises.
[19300] Since non-duality exists in clarity,
[19301] Equality wisdom arises.
[19302] Since seeing exists in non-duality,
