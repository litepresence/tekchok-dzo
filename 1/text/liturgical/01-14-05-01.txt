[18610] <tantra>From the Thalgyur Tantra:</tantra>
[18611] <prose>Furthermore, the wisdom of appearance is taught.</prose>
[18612] <verse>From earth, water, fire, wind, and space,
[18613] Wisdom-appearance wondrously arises.
[18614] Thus the Bhagavan, unexcelled Lord, transcends contact.</verse>
[18615] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18616] <verse>From within emptiness itself,
[18617] Wisdom sought by analysis is not found.
[18618] From severing the concepts of the three realms,
[18619] The five doors' fixation-stream is cut.</verse> || 10 ||
[18620] <verse>Moon and jewel, lapis lazuli light—
[18621] Whatever one desires to emanate,
[18622] Seize the appearance of the emanation body arisen from grasping.
[18623] Or else, from knowing the essential point
[18624] Of great perfection, wisdom itself
[18625] Free from activity, like space,
[18626] Transcends conceptual elaboration and reference.
[18627] Wondrous, marvelous wisdom—
[18628] Not before, not after, not primordially existent.
[18629] Now transcending the objects of conceptual mind,</verse> || 20 ||
[18630] <verse>The nature free from extremes, emptiness itself.
[18631] Beyond words, free from intellect, empty of essence.
[18632] Since nature is not divided anywhere,
[18633] Compassionate activity does not appear.
[18634] From the threefold wisdom-appearance,
[18635] Mind-arising, insight, and delusion-appearances are held.
[18636] This has no object of observation, no extreme.
[18637] From the marvelous play of neither existence nor non-existence,
[18638] Buddhas attain the result.
[18639] Externally and internally, all is dharmadhatu.</verse> || 30 ||
[18640] <verse>Here nothing whatsoever appears.</verse>
[18641] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18642] <prose>Third, the wisdom of objects: when form and the other five objects are self-liberated, the nature of the four appearances progressively increases.</prose>
[18643] <tantra>Again, from that very source:</tantra>
[18644] <prose>Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught.</prose>
[18645] <verse>From the varieties of form and sound,
[18646] The experiences to be trained become fivefold.
[18647] The experience of consciousness exhausted is appearance,
[18648] Waxing like the moon's bright fortnight.
[18649] Each appearance has its own experience.</verse> || 40 ||
[18650] <tantra>Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught.</tantra>
[18651] <verse>From warmth, measure, and signs,
[18652] The two truths inseparably joined, concept-extremes exhausted.
[18653] Without action, characteristics are empty.
[18654] Since the basis of expression ceases, extremes do not dwell.
[18655] Since outflows are exhausted, there is no clinging.
[18656] The source of memory cut, essence clear.
[18657] Clear awareness does not conceive objects' extremes.
[18658] Since it is free from sound, genuine, without words,</verse> || 50 ||
[18659] <verse>All reference points are exhausted.</verse>
[18660] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18661] <prose>The fourth topic has two aspects regarding individual meanings: brief presentation and detailed explanation.</prose>
[18662] <prose>First, the Sugata-essence, the naturally spontaneously present Buddha of the nature of reality, great wisdom of meaning, pervades all sentient beings without addition or subtraction, great or small, good or bad.</prose>
[18663] <tantra>From the common scripture, the Tathagatagarbha Sutra:</tantra>
[18664] <prose>"Within the bodies of all sentient beings, the Tathagatagarbha dwells as it was primordially."</prose>
[18665] <tantra>From the Uttaratantra:</tantra>
[18666] <verse>Since the Buddha-body radiates, || 60 ||
[18667] Since suchness is without division,
[18668] Since the potential exists,
[18669] All embodied beings always possess the Buddha-essence.</verse>
[18670] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18671] <tantra>From the uncommon scripture, the Tregchö:</tantra>
[18672] <verse>Sentient beings themselves are Buddhas.
[18673] However, they are obscured by adventitious defilements.</verse>
[18674] <tantra>And from the Doha:</tantra>
[18675] <verse>Through explaining treatises, all scholars
[18676] Do not realize Buddha exists within.</verse> || 70 ||
[18677] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18678] <tantra>From the unsurpassed scripture, the Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror Tantra, the Secret One:</tantra>
[18679] <prose>"Within all sentient beings of the world-systems, the Tathagatagarbha dwells like sesame pervaded by oil."</prose>
[18680] <prose>If one thinks that since it dwells thus, it should be visible to direct sight,</prose>
[18681] <prose>the body's appearance together with light is obscured by clinging, not found in the field of vision.</prose>
[18682] <prose>Yet now, like the sun example, dwelling within the body's cloud-mass,</prose>
[18683] <prose>when pointed out directly through the meaning,</prose>
[18684] <prose>the sign of the bindu, the lamp of emptiness, is shown—faith arises.</prose> || 80 ||
[18685] <prose>The speech is obscured by words;</prose>
[18686] <prose>the mind is obscured by conceptual mind, thus not seen.</prose>
[18687] <prose>The person of diligence who meditates on the four appearances as the measure, exists as it is now,</prose>
[18688] <prose>in the bardo, self-appearance pure, as it exists, will dawn.</prose>
[18689] <prose>Now it is like a garuda egg wrapped around—obscured by the growth of habitual patterns.</prose>
[18690] <tantra>From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Tantra:</tantra>
[18691] <verse>Within the self-body of all sentient beings, || 90 ||
[18692] The appearance of pure wisdom dwells.
[18693] Unable to manifest vastly,
[18694] Like the womb and the egg's shell—
[18695] Not emerging directly, though obscured,
[18696] When own-potency is perfected, it emerges.
[18697] When this conceptual body is abandoned,
[18698] Self-appearance and objects will meet.
[18699] Awareness itself, dwelling primordially,
[18700] Will be seen as essence without concept.</verse>
[18701] <verse>The appearance of pure wisdom
[18702] And Buddha-truth will be seen.
[18703] The essence of self-appearance, wisdom itself,
[18704] Is without conceptual mind.
[18705] Past objects and future objects—
[18706] Appearance is cut through directly.
[18707] The self-appearance of great wisdom,
[18708] Though not an immediate object,
[18709] Is shown by the self-arisen lamp.
[18710] That very lamp's wisdom
[18711] Transcends the extremes of appearance and non-appearance.</verse> || 100 ||
[18712] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18713] <prose>Furthermore, that great wisdom dwells in the heart-center, the pure light-channel, the celestial palace, as essence-body, with the complete marks and signs of the five lights.</prose>
[18714] <prose>Since its nature dwells as light, wisdom's appearance is measureless.</prose>
[18715] <prose>Since compassion and awareness dwell, knowledge is internally clear.</prose>
[18716] <prose>From that, resonating in the conch-shell chamber, the completely perfect great mandala of wrathful ones abides.</prose>
[18717] <list>Light,</list>
[18718] <list>Rays,</list>
[18719] <list>Bindus, and</list>
[18720] <list>subtle bindus—the resonance of appearance's nature, like the four great channels branching from the heart's light-channel, dwells naturally,</list>
[18721] <prose>and in the eyes dwells as four lamps.</prose>
[18722] <prose>That too: in the citta is the body;</prose>
[18723] <prose>in the four channels, bindus;</prose>
[18724] <prose>in the conch-chamber, light-rays;</prose>
[18725] <prose>in the eyes, Briguta—the appearance of Vajra Lougyu dwells.</prose> || 110 ||
[18726] <tantra>From Senge Tsal Dzogchen:</tantra>
[18727] <verse>Ema! The wisdom of awareness itself
[18728] Dwells unchangingly within all Buddhas and sentient beings.
[18729] That nature of reality is as follows:
[18730] The citta, the jewel-celestial palace;
[18731] The jewel-channel's celestial palace;
[18732] The pure conch-chamber celestial palace;
[18733] The Briguta celestial palace;
[18734] Within these great celestial palaces,
[18735] The essence of awareness appears as potency.</verse>
[18736] <tantra>That too is explained as follows:</tantra>
[18737] <verse>Some dwell as bodies;
[18738] Some are bindus;
[18739] One dwells as light-ray manner;
[18740] From one, Lougyu emerges.
[18741] Thus the dwelling-place is taught.
[18742] The meaning of Buddha primordially dwelling,
[18743] Dwelling within all sentient beings,
[18744] The Victorious Ones excellently explained.</verse> || 120 ||
[18745] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18746] <prose>Furthermore, body and Lougyu, dhatu and wisdom's meaning:</prose>
[18747] <tantra>From that very source:</tantra>
[18748] <verse>Awareness and non-awareness, appearance itself,
[18749] Transcends the extremes of actor and action.
[18750] Vastness itself radiates like a body;
[18751] Clarity itself arises like light;
[18752] Emptiness itself spreads like rays.
[18753] Buddha and sentient being—
[18754] Not separate awareness,
[18755] But taught as separate appearances.</verse>
[18756] <verse>The characteristics of the body are as follows:
[18757] Unchanging, clear,
[18758] Empty, and free from concept.
[18759] The characteristics of awareness are as follows:
[18760] Subtle, radiating,
[18761] Lougyu, and moving.
[18762] The characteristics of dhatu are as follows:
[18763] Vast, spontaneously thick, emptiness without limit, || 130 ||
[18764] Clear, warm, and cool,
[18765] Holding light-flexible essence,
[18766] Pervading, encircling, and encompassing.</verse>
[18767] <verse>The characteristics of wisdom are as follows:
[18768] Arising, entering, self-clear,
[18769] Primordial, knowing, realized.
[18770] Clear, radiant, and infinitely vast,
[18771] Appearance, darkness, and revealing,
[18772] Emptiness and clear wisdom supreme—
[18773] These are held as mantra characteristics.</verse>
[18774] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra> || 140 ||
[18775] <prose>That too: in the heart is the body; in the conch-mouth, wisdom; in Briguta, awareness; in the four channels, the appearance of dharmadhatu light and bindus dawn.</prose>
[18776] <prose>The four channels, from self-arising:</prose>
[18777] <verse>The pure white, smooth, empty channel;
[18778] The channels of jewel-radiance;
[18779] The great liberating channel;
[18780] The white crystal moving channel— || 150 ||
[18781] From these, consciousness mounted on wind
[18782] Enters through Briguta's great door,
[18783] Dissolving into the arising-path emptiness.
[18784] Without what dissolves, clarity like a vase,
[18785] The five-fold bindu, wisdom perfected.</verse>
[18786] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18787] <prose>That wisdom, self-abiding in the heart's great channel, clear resonance, abiding in its own light, wisdom's self-resonance,</prose>
[18788] <prose>is supported by the four channels' five wisdoms' self-resonance, maturing into the four lamps within cakṣu as the wisdom bindu, the lamp of emptiness, and the lamp of pure dharmadhatu,</prose>
[18789] <prose>and as measureless wisdom, the lasso-water lamp and self-arisen wisdom lamp,</prose>
[18790] <tantra>from the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[18791] <prose>Within the time of the body, as follows:</prose> || 160 ||
[18792] <verse>In the assembled elements, the aggregates,
[18793] Within the citta, the jewel-celestial palace,
[18794] The essence, pure from the letter KA,
[18795] Emptiness-clarity gathered, body's resonance,
[18796] Complete face and hands, vase-body manner,
[18797] Spontaneously present as light-mass,
[18798] Compassion individually clear in colors.
[18799] Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma,
[18800] Katishel, having the tube— || 170 ||
[18801] Mirror-like, equality, discriminating,
[18802] All-accomplishing, dharmadhatu wisdom:
[18803] Bindus moving and non-moving,
[18804] Abiding as supports of perfected own-potency.
[18805] From the gathered pure essence of both eyes,
[18806] Through method and wisdom's distinction,
[18807] The bindu of knowing the nature of reality,
[18808] And the lamp of pure dharmadhatu mature.
[18809] Measureless, the lasso and
[18810] Wisdom lamp mature,
[18811] Thus the karma of sentient beings, || 180 ||
[18812] And faculties' distinctions as they are,
[18813] Through training in these, one will know.</verse>
[18814] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18815] <prose>Second, detailed explanation has two aspects: general indication of the object of knowledge, and detailed explanation of the object to be adopted.</prose>
[18816] <prose>First, from eight aspects:</prose>
[18817] <list>The support is the form aggregate, the upper body.</list>
[18818] <list>The location is the heart jewel, eight-cornered, center of the pure light-channel, where the peaceful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells with awareness.</list>
[18819] <list>The path proceeds from the four channels.</list> || 190 ||
[18820] <list>The door is the two eyes.</list>
[18821] <list>The resonance is two lamps—like a peacock's and like the syllable HA.</list>
[18822] <list>The object is space free from clouds, dharmatā emptiness without thought or conceptualization.</list>
[18823] <list>The time is this very moment or when bardo appearance dawns.</list>
[18824] <list>The destination is the eight dawning-doors of spontaneous presence: those who recognize go to liberation in the dhatu; those who don't recognize wander in samsara—like the four path-forks.</list>
[18825] <list>The liberation-place is the appearance of original purity.</list>
[18826] <tantra>Thus also from Rangshar:</tantra>
[18827] <verse>Kye, companions, listen!</verse> || 200 ||
[18828] <prose>The suchness of all dharmas should be indicated by examples.</prose>
[18829] <prose>The intent of the perfectly complete Buddha is:</prose>
[18830] <list>The support relies on the form aggregate. Example: like sleeping in a bird's nest.</list>
[18831] <list>The location dwells in the heart—example: like a vase-body.</list>
[18832] <list>The path emerges from the four channels—example: like a pearl rosary strung.</list>
[18833] <list>It coils within the white conch-chamber—example: like a lamp placed inside a vase.</list>
[18834] <list>The door emerges from the eyes—example: like star-light.</list>
[18835] <list>The lamp of empty bindu—example: like a peacock's eye.</list>
[18836] <list>The lamp of dhatu-awareness—example: like the syllable NA RO.</list>
[18837] <list>The object is empty space.</list> || 210 ||
[18838] <list>The time is bardo appearance—example: like a mirror mandala.</list>
[18839] <list>The destination is the jewel body—example: like a rock-path.</list>
[18840] <list>The liberation-place is the appearance of original purity—example: like a vase-body.</list>
[18841] <tantra>And from Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror:</tantra>
[18842] <verse>Aho! Listen, great expanse-children!</verse>
[18843] <prose>Within all sentient beings of the world-systems, the Tathagatagarbha dwells like sesame seeds pervaded by oil.</prose>
[18844] <prose>That too: the support relies on the form aggregate.</prose>
[18845] <prose>The location dwells in the heart-center: Samantabhadra, called "cuckoo beak-sealed intention," dwells within like a cuckoo's sealed beak. Within, in the five-colored light center, the peaceful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells in the manner of light-mansion.</prose> || 220 ||
[18846] <prose>That is the location of awareness.</prose>
[18847] <prose>Example: like a vase-body.</prose>
[18848] <prose>The wisdom arising from that dwells in the head, the conch-chamber.</prose>
[18849] <prose>That too, the wrathful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells at the distance of drawn bow-string.</prose>
[18850] <prose>That too dwells as light-ray manner.</prose>
[18851] <prose>The light arising from that is clear like a mirror mandala, pure, or dwells as light-rays like a fish-eye.</prose>
[18852] <prose>The connection of that with awareness is: from the heart's tip, the white silk-thread channel upward, mere as a silk-leaf, passing through the throat, exists there. From there the path emerges and enters inside the head.</prose>
[18853] <prose>That channel too, from the small tip, right and left, emerges and connects to the head.</prose>
[18854] <prose>That too emerges from the right and left ear-flaps and connects to the eyes.</prose> || 230 ||
[18855] <prose>From there, turning the eyes to space, twisting the channel, looking, wisdom's light-appearance will fill space.</prose>
[18856] <prose>That too: from the heart-center's light-channel, the golden great channel Katishel branches, the upward tip white silk-leaf channel, from the heart-tip passing through the throat, from the ear branches three to the two eyes' door, pierces.</prose>
[18857] <prose>The central one pierces Brahma's aperture.</prose>
[18858] <prose>In the subtle, the coils are the centers of the four chakras, each connected from the heart.</prose>
[18859] <prose>The crystal-apertured one dwells with the resonance of the five clear-light winds at the life-force channel.</prose>
[18860] <prose>Second, detailed explanation of the wisdom object to be adopted has three aspects:</prose>
[18861] <list>The support, channels, to be purified;</list>
[18862] <list>The doors of arising, the lamps to be held;</list>
[18863] <list>The resonance of appearance, clear light to be shown.</list>
[18864] <prose>First, since wisdom dwells in the body, introducing it to the path through two essential points:</prose>
[18865] <prose>The general essential point: directing wind-mind to the lamp AH, exhausting dharmadhatu-awareness' increase-decrease,</prose>
[18866] <tantra>from the Thalgyur:</tantra> || 240 ||
[18867] <verse>Self-knowing wisdom dwells in the body,
[18868] Like oil within sesame seeds.
[18869] The body's radiance and splendor
[18870] Wisdom moistens, pervading.
[18871] Through corresponding with body, the bodies,
[18872] Wisdom's light-aura, colors, and signs.
[18873] Through karma, entering, and bodies,
[18874] Resonance and all pervading.
[18875] Insight itself and the lamp's function—
[18876] Ultimate and relative signs distinguished.
[18877] Maturing: each bindu's essential point;
[18878] Transforming: concept, coarse grasping. || 250 ||
[18879] Wisdom-appearance, four, two aspects,
[18880] From arising-entering's distinction.
[18881] In the citta, jewel-celestial palace,
[18882] Jewel-gathered, eight-cornered, doored,
[18883] Five wisdoms and five bodies,
[18884] Wind and knowledge's potency also five.
[18885] All are five-five's nature.
[18886] The body's essential point is through resonance.
[18887] Wisdom's posture through purity.
[18888] Lifting and stirring bindus accomplishes.
[18889] Light extending and gathering.
[18890] Connected meditation is wind's essential point. || 260 ||
[18891] The entering function distinguishes extremes.
[18892] Its transforming causes wind exhaustion.
[18893] Delusion's concordance to be joined.
[18894] Awareness' essential point is releasing,
[18895] Lifting and directing to space.
[18896] Dhatu's essential point is gathering,
[18897] Drawing and pervading elements.
[18898] Appearance's essential point: increase and exhaustion,
[18899] Various, self-liberated in their own place.</verse>
[18890] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18891] <prose>The specific essential point: pressing the essential points of four chakras and three main channels, introducing wind-mind into wisdom's network,</prose>
[18892] <tantra>from that very source:</tantra> || 270 ||
[18893] <verse>Awareness-wisdom's path itself,
[18894] Within one's own channel-chakra,
[18895] Where body-speech self-perfectly dwells,
[18896] Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma,
[18897] The three mothers hold the body,
[18898] The central supports four chakras.
[18899] These dwelling right, left, center,
[18900] Through relative-ultimate distinction,
[18901] Generate body and limbs,
[18902] And mature the lamp itself.
[18903] Roma circulates tastes in the chakra, || 280 ||
[18904] Wind urges, bindus emanate.
[18905] Since taste relies on channels,
[18906] Bliss expands body and mind.
[18907] MA gathers the pure essence,
[18908] Establishes base of upper-lower locations.
[18909] Lifting and pressing in this is essential.
[18910] In this's six branches,
[18911] Burning and incinerating, wisdom ceases.
[18912] If desiring warmth-attainment, pressing is essential.
[18913] Wind and bindu should be drawn.
[18914] Kyangma generates in the chakra, || 290 ||
[18915] Wind emanates, gathers, bindus enter.
[18916] "Kyang" means peerless,
[18917] Revealing unique intention.
[18918] MA clears the old,
[18919] Generates essence-splendor.
[18920] In this, opening and pressing is essential.
[18921] In this, the branch not appearing,
[18922] Place bindus in the four corners.
[18923] Desiring food-control,
[18924] Press wind, don't expel water.
[18925] Through samaya, examine channels. || 300 ||
[18926] Kundarma is mindfulness,
[18927] Gathering the tip-chakra matures.
[18928] Reversing karma-wind, holds wisdom.
[18929] "Kun" gives emanation body qualities.
[18930] Shaking is enjoyment body qualities.
[18931] MA actually shows dharmakaya.
[18932] In this's twelve branches,
[18933] Opening and twisting is essential.
[18934] Extending life, rely on applying.
[18935] Bindus, through body and mind.
[18936] From this wisdom-path, || 310 ||
[18937] Bindus and body are obtained.
[18938] Wind performs all going-coming actions.
[18939] Mind's lord held by mentation.
[18940] Path-held and drawn.</verse>
[18941] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18942] <prose>Second, holding the doors of arising, the lamps, has two aspects: door and lamp.</prose>
[18943] <prose>The door's essential point: the channel connecting heart to head, the faults and qualities of the sense-faculties' clarifier, has five branches in the eye. From the center of the deer-horn-like channel's coils, from the light-channel, wisdom actually emerges. Looking unwaveringly into space's expanse is the true essential point,</prose>
[18944] <tantra>from the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[18945] <verse>The door of wisdom's arising itself, || 320 ||
[18946] All body-essence, pure gathering,
[18947] Emerging from the door called cakṣu,
[18948] Holding both aspects, showing appearance.
[18949] Arising from connected generating channels.
[18950] From the tip becoming one,
[18951] Dawning for faculties' objects,
[18952] In one having five branches,
[18953] Appearing in each faculty's door.
[18954] Particularly distinguishing faults and qualities,
[18955] From deer-horn-like coils,
[18956] "A-bré" called, half white-black, || 330 ||
[18957] Knowing and holding forms,
[18958] Perfectly showing knowledge's own-potency.
[18959] In this, wisdom actually emerges,
[18960] Directly and through self-essential point,
[18961] The pure dharmatā self-appearance object,
[18962] Abiding with concept ceasing.</verse>
[18963] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18964] <prose>The lamp's essential point: through gaze-binding and gazing-binding, pressing, directing, leading, and training in sun-moon support,</prose>
[18965] <tantra>from that very source:</tantra>
[18966] <verse>From ultimate dharmatā arising, || 340 ||
[18967] Lamps are of four types:
[18968] Maturing, entering, pervading-emptiness,
[18969] Gathering dharmatā's object-appearance.
[18970] From the lasso, forms are gathered,
[18971] Wind cuts and emanates.
[18972] Through coming-going's increase-decrease,
[18973] Pure wisdom is gathered.
[18974] The empty bindu performs all actions.
[18975] Holding the past path's aspect,
[18976] Wind generates radiance and splendor.
[18977] Transforming, showing wisdom-appearance. || 350 ||
[18978] Through self-arisen wisdom lamp,
[18979] All dharmas equally, one taste,
[18980] Gathered, holding self-appearance.
[18981] This cuts habitual pattern connections.
[18982] Dhatu gathers pure essence,
[18983] Awareness holds the bodies,
[18984] Through three essential points maturing essence,
[18985] Samsara is abandoned.
[18986] Thus from the eye, lamp arising,
[18987] Buddha-intention's essential points gathered,
[18988] Holding self-appearance objects.
[18989] The lamp's essential point I explain— || 360 ||
[18990] Deva-son of good fortune, you listen!
[18991] Through objects, awareness, and wind,
[18992] In order to hold dharmatā as path,
[18993] Through perfected wisdom,
[18994] This too is the lamp's essential point.
[18995] Lasso unmoving is essential.
[18996] At this time, join with three gazes.
[18997] Wisdom lamp training's essential point—
[18998] Three rituals extending,
[18999] Through accomplishing essential point, generate expanse.
[18900] Bindu-lamp pressing is essential. || 370 ||
[18901] Through not separating channel and thumb-finger,
[18902] Wisdom increases upward.
[18903] Dhatu's essential point is leading.
[18904] Yogins, properly join sun-training methods,
[18905] Lead well.
[18906] Train also in moon.
[18907] Whoever does this continuously,
[18908] Delusion-appearance-stream ceases.
[18909] Five pure wisdoms' light,
[18910] Through emptying earth, stone, rock-mountain, || 380 ||
[18911] Ship-broken or mere land-island—
[18912] Those skilled in leading will see.
[18913] At this time, method-adjustment is essential.
[18914] Through perfection, dharmatā is obtained.
[18915] Thus through habituation, dharmatā's power,
[18916] Body-arising self-perfects in its own place.
[18917] Thus through body-arising stream-ceasing,
[18918] Outflow-aggregates become invisible,
[18919] In this, perfect buddhahood.</verse>
[18920] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra> || 390 ||
[18921] <prose>Third, showing the resonance of appearance, clear light, has five aspects:</prose>
[18922] <list>Body,</list>
[18923] <list>Wisdom,</list>
[18924] <list>Light,</list>
[18925] <list>Bindu, and</list>
[18926] <list>detailed explanation of awareness' nature.</list>
[18927] <prose>First has two aspects: brief presentation and detailed explanation.</prose>
[18928] <prose>First,</prose>
[18929] <tantra>from the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[18930] <verse>Within the citta, body dwells as body.
[18931] Resonance-body through five aspects
[18932] Holds each family's characteristics. || 400 ||
[18933] Ray-body through six also
[18934] Gathers nature-appearance's dharmatā.
[18935] Pure body through three
[18936] Holds nirvana's indication.
[18937] Aspect-body through eight also
[18938] Performs complete stage-path actions.</verse>
[18939] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18940] <prose>Since citta's essence dwells as body's arising-base, when that resonance, the five families' bodies unmixed, measure dawns, appearance dawns.</prose>
[18941] <prose>From the body, rays emanate; within channels, bindus ray-resonance, external expansion, and appearance's subtle body, six aspects appear.</prose>
[18942] <prose>The wisdom three liberated, body's liberation-place, holding the measure of internal dhatu exhaustion.</prose> || 410 ||
[18943] <prose>The eight aspect-bodies are at the completion-stage, spontaneously present ground, from dividing three bodies into nine;</prose>
[18944] <prose>Dharmakaya's dharmakaya, pure dharmadhatu, all's arising-base, established as base, not counted separately, thus eight.</prose>
[18945] <prose>Second, detailed explanation of body has two aspects:</prose>

[18949] <list>Awareness object-appearance's body and</list>
[18950] <list>Pure essence gathered body,</list>
[18951] <tantra>from Sun-Moon Seal:</tantra>
[18952] <prose>Body is twofold: awareness object-appearance's body and pure essences gathered body.</prose> || 420 ||
[18953] <prose>First, appearing to faculties, without negation or proof;</prose>
[18954] <prose>Distinguishing: faculties, aggregates, objects and subjects, pure body, and three,</prose>
[18955] <tantra>from that very source:</tantra>
[18956] <prose>The body appearing to awareness-objects is the great body of faculties purified, the great body of aggregates purified, the great body of dhātus and āyatanas, objects and subjects, and afflictions purified.</prose>
[18957] <prose>Second, the pure essence gathered body appears to those habituated into power:</prose>
[18958] <prose>Distinguishing: the body holding the unmistaken path's own-characteristics, and the body unchanging in color-light characteristics, as-it-is, from these two, first:</prose>
[18959] <tantra>From Sun-Moon Seal:</tantra> || 430 ||
[18960] <verse>Through essence, nature, compassion three,
[18961] Holding path's characteristics,
[18962] Causing result to reach measure,
[18963] Great Play body and
[18964] Great General body and
[18965] Family-sustaining body are renowned.</verse>
[18966] <tantra>From Sun-Moon Seal:</tantra>
[18967] <prose>The body holding own-characteristics is as follows: non-dividing Great Play body, supreme Great General body, and family-sustaining body.</prose>
[18968] <prose>Second, the as-it-is body has three aspects: base, path, and result.</prose>
[18969] <prose>The body dwelling in base self-arisen wisdom, the body unchanging from external appearance of light-resonance dhatu-body primeval,</prose>
[18970] <prose>the three bodies spontaneously present dhatu-exhausted destination reached,</prose> || 440 ||
[18971] <tantra>from that very source:</tantra>
[18972] <prose>The as-it-is body is as follows: primordially abiding first body, primeval unchanging body, and result self-perfecting body.</prose>
[18973] <prose>The result self-perfecting body is threefold:</prose>
[18974] <tantra>Dharmakaya without elaboration great, Saṃbhogakaya without grasping great, and Nirmāṇakaya without self great.</tantra>

[18979] <prose>Second: what are the characteristics of these thirteen bodies? Explained from that very source:</prose>
[18980] <tantra>That is as follows:</tantra>
[18981] <prose>The base awareness body is Vajra Lougyu's body. It is clear to one's unceased eye-faculty. That is called the base awareness body.</prose>

[18996] Abiding as body and wisdom's essence.
[18997] That is called the vast dharmatā body.
[18998] The expanded dhatu body is the pure dharmadhatu lamp.
[18999] That dhatu too is unbroken, non-fallen in directions,

[18918] <prose>That is the seeing self-liberated body.</prose>
[18919] <prose>The one bindu body is:</prose>
[18920] <verse>All-pervading arising wisdom,
[18921] All-pervading appearance wisdom,
[18922] All-pervading arising wisdom, || 510 ||

[18925] All-pervading sky-clear wisdom,
[18926] All-pervading self-arisen wisdom.
[18927] That is the one bindu body.

[18929] <prose>That is called the unbroken space body.</prose> || 520 ||
[18930] <prose>The non-fallen-directions sun-moon body is: grasping-free self-liberated, concept-free self-Buddha, unchanging self-pure, unclear radiance, meditation-free dharmatā, ungraspable vastness, sentient beings without Buddha.</prose>
[18931] <prose>That is the non-fallen-directions sun-moon body.</prose>

[18933] <prose>That is the non-dual lamp body.</prose>
[18934] <prose>The attachment-free self-liberated body is:</prose>

[18963] <list>Base-dwelling wisdom and</list>
[18964] <list>Characteristic-holding wisdom.</list>
[18965] <prose>First, from essence, nature, compassion three: essence appears as body; nature appears as light; compassion's activity appears as enlightened activity.</prose>
[18966] <tantra>Thus also from Sun-Moon Seal:</tantra>
[18967] <prose>Base-dwelling wisdom is threefold: essence original purity wisdom, nature spontaneously present wisdom, and compassion self-appearance wisdom.</prose>
[18968] <prose>Second, the five characteristic-holding wisdoms: since dhatu exists in body, from its potency arises,</prose>
[18969] <tantra>from Rangshar:</tantra> || 560 ||
[18970] <verse>From unchanging body, unceasing wisdom arises.
[18971] That is as follows:
[18972] Since dhatu exists in body, dharmadhatu wisdom arises.
[18973] Since clarity-aspect exists in dhatu, mirror-like wisdom arises.
[18974] Since non-duality exists in clarity, equality wisdom arises.
[18975] Since seeing exists in non-duality, discriminate wisdom arises.
[18976] Since action exists in seeing, accomplish-action wisdom arises.</verse>
[18977] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[18978] <prose>Third, the wisdom of light's own-tone.</prose> || 570 ||
