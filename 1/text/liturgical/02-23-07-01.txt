[14278] First:
[14279] Although natural expression appears as light,
[14280] Recognizing that one's own face is awareness-resonance inseparable from the single expanse, the primordially pure clarity-emptiness crystal-clear nature—this decisive cutting is introduction to the ultimate liberation ground, directly revealing naked View.
[14281] Second:
[14282] Within that very nature, without deliberate placement or abandonment, decisively cutting through natural meditative stability, neither distracted nor grasping—this is meditation.
[14283] Third:
[14284] At that time, awareness naturally lucent, beyond meditation object and meditator, liberated as it arises, having confidence in self-liberation without rejecting good or bad conceptual constructs, to be repeated—
[14285] the first crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[14286] Although the natural realm appears variously, beyond mere appearance,
[14287] Gathering self-lucid naked pristine cognition into unified vastness, reciting it as self-lucid self-arisen pristine cognition and meditating thus,


### PAGE 342

[14288] even grasping at that is liberated.
[14289] Furthermore, there is nothing else:
[14290] This is the quintessential instruction for liberating light-appearance into Dharma-nature,
[14291] Introducing the nature of awareness instantly naked, outwardly looking yet inwardly lucid—
[14292] Looking at appearances, they are infinite, yet
[14293] Looking at awareness, not even one exists, naturally lucent self-arisen;
[14294] the pith instruction of striking liberation ground directly.
[14295] The second crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[14296] Regarding compassion's vital point:
[14297] When awareness as means to guide manifold outward disciples radiates in various forms inwardly,
[14298] Do not cut the trail of outward radiation;
[14299] Do not examine your own face;
[14300] Without inward rejection, leave whatever arises resting just there;
[14301] By recognizing that uninterrupted knowing nakedly naturally lucent,
[14302] Liberation ground is directly revealed;
[14303] By recognizing this very instantaneous naturally resolved awareness, continuously naked without transition, together with bardo consciousness manifesting unceasingly,
[14304] Primordially pure compassionate awareness is recognized and liberated—
[14305] the third crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[14306] These three are secret heart-nectar, supremely refined essence, utterly secret,
[14307] Greatly decisive in oral transmission,
[14308] Greatly binding in Sutra and Tantra,
[14309] Vitally important in profound crucial points,
[14310] The quintessential instruction of heart-sons supreme, sealing secrecy from others.
[14311] This is self-attained from the Vajra Realm of the Tantra;
[14312] Although self-realizing many such points, explaining to others they will not understand;
[14313] Showing, they will not realize;
[14314] Returning and dissolving into oneself, like rivers flowing into the ocean then dissolving therein.
[14315] Aligning the three vital points with scripture:
[14316] From Thalgyur:
[14317] Furthermore, the entity of Dharma-nature,
[14318] Established as entity from self-nature itself,
[14319] Since manner of appearance is uncertainly one,
[14320] Paths of entry are also different.
[14321] Through face, knowing, and liberation sight,
[14322] Entry, seeing, and familiarity,
[14323] Knowing the face is one's own face;
[14324] Confidence is the heart ground.
[14325] Decisive cutting enters into confidence;
[14326] Thus through these three, the certain deed:
[14327] Entity complete, cause ceases.
[14328] Furthermore, explaining Dharma-nature's nature:
[14329] Here, since not one but uncertain,
[14330] However imputed, thus appearing;
[14331] From various naming bases,
[14332] Words and terms manifoldly proliferate;
[14333] From uncertain various names,
[14334] Meanings too are empty of mere imputation;
[14335] Since emptiness is nowhere established,
[14336] Naturally pure thus appears.
[14337] Furthermore, explaining Dharma-nature compassion:
[14338] Since disciples' objects are manifold,
[14339] Guiding Bodies are also just so;
[14340] From dispositions and faculties' displays,
[14341] Samsara and nirvana cognitions differ;
[14342] When that itself is placed as respective objects,
[14343] The uncorrected meaning-intention.
[14344] Thus it is.
[14345] Second, fixing attention through crucial points of the three times:


### PAGE 343

[14346] From the two—the realm of three times and the pith instruction of method—
[14347] Regarding crucial points there are three:
[14348] The crucial point of knowing entry,
[14349] The crucial point of one's own face liberation,
[14350] The crucial point of recognizing face completion.
[14351] First:
[14352] When awareness enters outward into luminosity-appearance, knowing resonance as self-appearance; and
[14353] When light-appearance enters inward into awareness, knowing that nature inseparable from primordially pure ground, unmoving.
[14354] Second:
[14355] At the time of applying the four pristine cognitions, knowing the crucial instruction of recognizing one's own face through liberation of outer, inner, and secret abiding in one's own face,
[14356] Also, aggregates' self-grasping cleared, body liberated into luminosity, abiding in Dharma-nature own face,
[14357] Liberated from elements' coarse subtle solidity,
[14358] Appearance abides in luminosity, great bliss,
[14359] Awareness, liberated from afflictions coarse subtle, dissolves into mother abiding.
[14360] Also, outer delusion purified, awareness meets Dharma-nature mother and knows, conditions manifoldly appearing as objects, things coarse subtle liberated, mother-child non-dual liberation.
[14361] How is liberation?
[14362] Earth element's characteristic self-purified, body freed from flesh-bondage;
[14363] Water purified, blood;
[14364] Fire purified, warmth;
[14365] Wind purified, freed from breath-bondage—
[14366] Without conceptual horse,
[14367] Flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated;
[14368] Inner awareness without affliction stain, five pristine cognitions self-appear;
[14369] Without knowable stain, phenomena and Dharma-nature non-dual,
[14370] Knowing one's own face thus abiding,
[14371] Now awareness cannot produce afflictions,
[14372] Liberated from samsara karmic ripening;
[14373] Since afflictions cannot abide in awareness own face,
[14374] Secret awareness Dharma-nature, neither existent nor non-existent, neither eternal nor nihilistic, thing nor emptiness—falling into neither extreme,
[14375] Outer phenomena object and subject,
[14376] Inner phenomena variously grasping conceptual discrimination,
[14377] Secret phenomena awareness itself—without even slightest grasping, knowing one's own face.
[14378] Third, the crucial point of recognizing face completion:


### PAGE 344

[14380] Awareness arriving at the spontaneous precious jewel's own object, abiding inseparable from primordial purity and spontaneous presence, recognizing that,
[14381] All samsaric phenomena purified at that time, decisively cutting prior delusion never experienced,
[14382] Now obtaining the Body of no-return delusion impossible, awareness itself without turning back,
[14383] Samsara's delusory appearance,
[14384] Nirvana's pure appearance dissolving into Expanse, when neither existence nor non-existence, eternal nor nihilistic established anywhere, alternating samsara-nirvana, ground liberation attained—at the time of spontaneous dissolution, recognize.
[14385] This is awareness own face's vital importance.
[14386] Second, regarding method's pith instruction, from two:
[14387] The previous pith instruction's crucial points familiarized and introduced in this life, recognizing outwardly inwardly as previously known, at that time liberated without doubt;
[14388] This time's pith instruction: sharp awareness transcending ground from the start, like a shooting star racing through space, recognizing own face instantly and liberated;
[14389] Dull awareness not recognizing various appearances' distinctions, through the power of previously practiced profundity,
[14390] Lion-cub freed from womb-enclosure, purifying solidity, liberated in whichever of twenty-one faculties' five or more instants.
[14391] These from Sun Moon Union:
[14392] This time has three:
[14393] Time of entry,
[14394] Time of liberation,
[14395] Time of completion.
[14396] Time of entry has two:
[14397] Awareness entering outward into light,
[14398] Light entering inward into awareness.
[14399] Liberation has three:
[14400] Awareness freed from elements through separation from conditions;
[14401] Awareness without stain,
[14402] Liberated from afflictions;
[14403] Awareness itself not falling into any extreme, liberated from outer and inner phenomena.
[14404] Completion is shown as awareness itself, all phenomena's appearance, liberated simultaneously.
[14405] Methods are two:


### PAGE 345

[14406] Previous pith instruction's crucial point,
[14407] This time's sharp and dull awareness distinction, thus.
[14408] Third, gathering meaning through self-appearance faculties' liberation mode, threefold:
[14409] Faculties' divisions generally shown,
[14410] Liberation-delusion stages specifically explained,
[14411] Individual faculties' liberation mode extensively spoken.
[14412] First: faculties sharp, dull, medium, combined lowest,
[14413] medium,
[14414] excellent,
[14415] peak,
[14416] supreme,
[14417] utmost,
[14418] complete—seven each, making twenty-one,
[14419] Each pristine cognition appearance mode,
[14420] Each delusion basis of aspect,
[14421] Each realization measure,
[14422] Each knowledge examination mode,
[14423] Each self-appearance liberation mode—separately arising,
[14424] Thus faculties explained as twenty-one,
[14425] From Self-Arisen:
<verse> [14426] Listen, devoted assembly!
<verse> [14427] To dispel sentient beings' ignorance,
<verse> [14428] Since twenty-one appearance modes exist,
<verse> [14429] These I teach—attend with care.
[14430] Faculties shown through three aspects:
<list> [14431] Excellent,
<list> [14432] Medium,
<list> [14433] Excellent has seven:
<list> [14434] Excellent lowest,
<list> [14435] Excellent medium,
<list> [14436] Excellent excellent,
<list> [14437] Excellent supreme,
<list> [14438] Excellent utmost,
<list> [14439] Excellent peak,
<list> [14440] Excellent complete.
[14441] These are excellent's divisions.
[14442] These too have view-reversal each,
[14443] Pristine cognition appearance arising mode each,
[14444] Realization measure each,
[14445] Understanding time each,
[14446] Knowledge examination mode each arising, stability obtained in respective appearance.
[14447] Medium also has seven:
<list> [14448] Medium lowest,
<list> [14449] Medium medium,
<list> [14450] Medium excellent,
<list> [14451] Medium supreme,
<list> [14452] Medium utmost,
<list> [14453] Medium peak,
<list> [14454] Medium complete;
[14455] Each also pristine cognition arising measure arises.
[14456] These are medium's.
[14457] Lowest also seven:
<list> [14458] Lowest lowest,
<list> [14459] Lowest medium,
<list> [14460] Lowest excellent,
<list> [14461] Lowest supreme,
<list> [14462] Lowest utmost,
<list> [14463] Lowest peak,
<list> [14464] Lowest complete, thus.
[14465] Second, specifically explaining liberation-delusion stages:


### PAGE 346

<tantra> [14466] From Sun Moon Union:
[14467] Some obtain stability distinctly in the twenty-one faculties;
[14468] Those not comprehending their own knowledge, again without guru's oral transmission, become bewildered at that appearance,
[14469] Astonished,
[14470] Frightened,
[14471] Terrified,
[14472] Losing recognition, and so forth—
[14473] Again grasping samsara's near appropriation,
[14474] Also twenty-one faculties distinctly deluded exist.
[14475] Thus the three faculties:
[14476] Excellent liberate in three instants;
[14477] Medium may obtain stability in five days;
[14478] Twenty-one instants obtain stability.
[14479] Lowest, expiring into natural Emanation-Body pure land, without bardo attain buddhahood, thus.
[14480] Here three:
<list> [14481] Twenty-one faculties delusion mode,
<list> [14482] Liberation mode,
<list> [14483] Dispelling delusion regarding distinction mode.
[14484] First:
[14485] Those not seeing this teaching's door through previous guru's great secret certain oral transmission, and
[14486] Those seen yet lacking confidence,
[14487] Laziness,
[14488] Distracted—lowest of lowest faculties, not obtaining power over Dharma-nature bardo self-appearance, greatly bewildered,
[14489] Not finding certainty, greatly appearing,
[14490] "From what ancestry did this arise?" thinking,
[14491] Face not meeting, innermost frightened, thinking,
[14492] Not previously practicing even an instant directly, "What is this appearance? Is it faculty delusion?" recognition perversely arising, and so forth—
[14493] Not recognizing self-appearance, again grasping samsara's near appropriation existence-bardo,
[14494] Twenty-one faculties delusion exist.
[14495] How deluded?
[14496] When seeing great appearance,
[14497] Lowest lowest, outwardly grasping all as object-aspect, deluded;
[14498] Lowest medium, attachment's fault deluded;
[14499] Lowest excellent, self-grasping immediately as condition, deluded;
[14500] Lowest supreme, grasping self-characteristic as mark, deluded;
[14501] Lowest utmost, not knowing anywhere, deluded by bewildered ignorance;
[14502] Lowest peak, "What is this?" thinking, doubt entering, deluded;
[14503] Lowest complete, grasping that itself as object's portion self, deluded;
[14504] Medium lowest, seeing lucidity as empty of thing, deluded;
[14505] Medium medium, grasping thing attachment-grasping as heart essence, deluded;
[14506] Medium excellent, distracted in object, not knowing anywhere, deluded by child-seeing-appearance ignorance;
[14507] Medium supreme, making knowledge grasping condition, deluded;
[14508] Medium utmost, examined as grasped object, deluded;
[14509] Medium peak, grasping "Such appearance arose to me" as hope-fear, deluded;
[14510] Medium complete, placing in certainty, not knowing self-appearance, deluded;
[14511] Excellent lowest, grasping as beautiful, deluded;
[14512] Excellent medium, grasping attachment to beauty, deluded;
[14513] Excellent excellent, not grasping anywhere yet distracted, without recognition, deluded;
[14514] Excellent supreme, appearance's object making cause-self one grasping, deluded;
[14515] Excellent utmost, not knowing instantaneous change aspect, deluded;
[14516] Excellent peak, grasping signs and marks as formed, deluded;
[14517] Excellent complete, not knowing anywhere, deluded by appearance force or bewilderment.
[14518] All delusion modes, twenty-one included here,


### PAGE 347

[14519] Not deluding in bardo is extremely precious.
[14520] Also regarding this, now outer ordinary appearance and
[14521] Luminosity portion self-appearance, instant by instant nakedly each recognizing—extremely precious.
[14522] Also from Self-Arisen:
<verse> [14523] Listen, nearby assembly!
<verse> [14524] Sentient beings in bardo delude thus:
<verse> [14525] Some delude from aspect,
<verse> [14526] Some delude from experience,
<verse> [14527] Some delude from immediacy,
<verse> [14528] Some delude from fixation,
<verse> [14529] Some delude from "what is this?" thinking,
<verse> [14530] Some delude from thought-construct,
<verse> [14531] Some delude from object; some delude from no-object;
<verse> [14532] Some delude from heart essence,
<verse> [14533] Some delude from ignorance,
<verse> [14534] Some delude from conditions,
<verse> [14535] Some delude from examination,
<verse> [14536] Some delude from self,
<verse> [14537] Some delude from not recognizing face,
<verse> [14538] Some delude from grasping,
<verse> [14539] Some delude from no-grasping,
<verse> [14540] Some delude from recognition,
<verse> [14541] Some delude from cause,
<verse> [14542] Some delude from instant,
<verse> [14543] Some delude from signs,
<verse> [14544] Some delude from force.
[14545] Since bardo sentient beings' minds are twenty-one,
[14546] One delusion mode completes appearance,
[14547] Thus for each delusion mode, appearance arises;
[14548] Thus extensively shown, bardo delusion modes, thus.
[14549] Second, liberation mode does not transcend twenty-one faculty stages,
[14550] Not transcending excellent, medium, lowest three.
[14551] Here excellent three instants,
[14552] Medium five,
[14553] Lowest seven to twenty-one liberated.
[14554] Their lowest cannot liberate from birth in natural Emanation pure land.
[14555] Excellent complete liberates in primordial purity in three instants.
<tantra> [14556] From Blazing Relic Body:
<verse> [14557] Shooting stars through space,
<verse> [14558] Racing mode, three instants,
<verse> [14559] Even with Emanation itself,
<verse> [14560] Into own-entity self-dissolved.
[14561] Thus.
[14562] Excellent remaining six actions complete in three instants, complete.
[14563] Faculty distinction: instant duration long-short exists,


### PAGE 348

[14564] Some take from one to six days of meditative stability.
[14565] Completion does not depend on days from three liberation instants.
[14566] This arises from realization's potency.
[14567] Liberation instant: when knowledge arises at appearance, abiding there, object-known duration counted as one instant, three instants liberated.
[14568] Medium and
[14569] Lowest instants longer than that,
[14570] Calculating action-complete instant, now explained.
[14571] Third, dispelling delusion regarding distinction:
[14572] Delusion and
[14373] Its dispelling, from two:
[14574] Delusion regarding portion: many tantras and pith instructions, some three instants,
<list> [14575] Five,
<list> [14576] Some three days,
<list> [14577] Twenty-one and so forth explained, not distinguishing meditative stability days and
[14578] Liberation instants, grasping two as one, explained.
[14579] Dispelling from two:
[14580] Reasoning:
[14581] If those two were one, excellent peak subject would be liberated in one instant,
[14582] Because liberated in one day of meditative stability;
[14583] If accepting, excellent three instants liberated is clear.
[14584] Likewise excellent lowest would be liberated in six instants,
[14585] Because liberated in six days.
[14586] If accepting, excellent whichever, three instants liberated is clear.
[14587] Also liberating in interval passage time's primordial purity, yet three instants certain,
