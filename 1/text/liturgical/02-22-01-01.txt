[10211] <prose> Liberation and confusion in the intermediate state and future life, and the signs of certainty, are concluded through secret sealing.
[10212] <prose> First has three aspects.
[10213] <prose> Signs of how previously the body trained in the three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[10214] <prose> Signs of how speech habituated.
[10215] <prose> Signs of how mind trained.
[10216] <prose> First.
[10217] <prose> In previous life, training through the body in the three kayas of body, speech, and mind, if interrupted, now showing those signs has four aspects.
[10218] <prose> The sequence of signs.
[10219] <prose> The suitability of arising.
[10220] <prose> The result if habituated. || 10 ||
[10221] <prose> If not habituated, certainty is not obtained.
[10222] <prose> First.
[10223] <tantra> From the Glorious Infinite Space Blazing Relics Tantra.
[10224] <prose> As the completely enlightened Buddhas.
[10225] <prose> Body signs and speech signs.
[10226] <prose> Similarly mind vajra signs.
[10227] <prose> As previously dawned.
[10228] <prose> Here too upon all sentient beings' bodies.
[10229] <prose> These will all appear.
[10230] <prose> To whom these appear. || 20 ||
[10231] <prose> Fortunate ones who trained previously.
[10232] <tantra> From not ripening previously.
[10233] <prose> Now at this time definite result.
[10234] <prose> For whomever accomplishes.
[10235] <prose> Body signs and similarly speech.
[10236] <prose> Mind and so forth, these signs arise.
[10237] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10238] <prose> Signs of having trained in previous life in Buddha's body, for a man or woman, at the forehead center, clockwise-swirling conch or trident-like crease standing upward and.
[10239] <prose> Om marks and.
[10240] <prose> Lines or. || 30 ||
[10241] <prose> Self-protruding.
[10242] <prose> Signs of training in speech, for a man at the right of the throat and.
[10243] <prose> For a woman at the left, eight-petaled lotus or.
[10244] <prose> Clockwise-swirling conch or.
[10245] <prose> Banner-like or.
[10246] <prose> Hook and.
[10247] <prose> Sword and.
[10248] <prose> Marks of Ah syllable, lines or.
[10249] <prose> Self-protruding.
[10250] <prose> Signs of training in mind, at the heart, vajra and. || 40 ||
[10251] <prose> Wheel and.
[10252] <prose> Trident's flesh mark or.
[10253] <prose> Jewel shape or.
[10254] <prose> Syllable form with Hum.
[10255] <prose> Second, the suitability of how these signs arise.
[10256] <prose> In all beings, from the ground, the three kayas of body, speech, and mind exist in oneself, now appearing through previous training.
[10257] <tantra> From that itself.
[10258] <prose> Even butchers, prostitutes, unfortunate ones.
[10259] <tantra> From the ground, three kayas of body, speech, and mind exist.
[10260] <prose> Therefore through previous habituation. || 50 ||
[10261] <prose> For those who entered interruption above.
[10262] <prose> The above three kayas of body, speech, and mind signs.
[10263] <prose> These arise in all.
[10264] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10265] <prose> Third, how results are obtained if habituated.
[10266] <prose> Through these signs, if effort is made in this life, quickly liberated in three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[10267] <prose> Body signs exist, training in body now, in two lives obtaining vajra body.
[10268] <prose> Through speech obtaining speech vajra, in two lives accomplishing.
[10269] <prose> Through habituation in mind, accomplishing in three.
[10270] <prose> The knowledge that establishes certainty of results of signs and habituation. || 60 ||
[10271] <tantra> From the Blazing Relics Tantra.
[10272] <prose> Whoever trains in Sugata body.
[10273] <prose> At that one's forehead expanse.
[10274] <prose> Conch swirling clockwise or.
[10275] <prose> Or trident crease standing upward.
[10276] <prose> Similarly also syllable Om.
[10277] <prose> Lines or self-protruding.
[10278] <prose> To whom these signs arise.
[10279] <prose> Previously trained in Buddha body.
[10280] <prose> This yogin who trained. || 70 ||
[10281] <prose> Inseparable from Buddha body.
[10282] <prose> With confidence at the time.
[10283] <prose> Life two will be obtained.
[10284] <prose> Without interruption entering this.
[10285] <prose> Diligent in meditation itself.
[10286] <prose> This is extremely precious.
[10287] <prose> In all Buddhas' speech.
[10288] <prose> Whoever trained previously.
[10289] <prose> To the fortunate one endowed with fortune.
[10290] <prose> At that one's throat right and left. || 80 ||
[10291] <prose> Eight-petaled lotus or.
[10292] <prose> Or conch swirling clockwise.
[10293] <prose> Similarly unfurled banner or.
[10294] <prose> Hook or sword and.
[10295] <prose> Marked by syllable Ah.
[10296] <prose> Lines or protruding.
[10297] <prose> To whomever exists, that person.
[10298] <prose> In all Buddhas' speech too.
[10299] <prose> Through this one trained previously.
[10300] <prose> In two lives in one speech. || 90 ||
[10301] <prose> Definite result will be obtained.
[10302] <prose> This too precious without interruption.
[10303] <prose> If speech meditation is practiced without interruption.
[10304] <prose> Definitely will be obtained without doubt.
[10305] <prose> In Buddhas' mind too.
[10306] <prose> Whoever habituated previously.
[10307] <prose> These signs appear on this body.
[10308] <prose> At whose heart place.
[10309] <prose> Trident vajra standing upward and.
[10310] <prose> Similarly wheel with four spokes or. || 100 ||
[10311] <prose> Third stage flesh mark or.
[10312] <prose> Jewel shape itself or.
[10313] <prose> Hum syllable mark.
[10314] <prose> To whom arises, that person.
[10315] <prose> In Buddha's mind too.
[10316] <prose> This one habituated, endowed with fortune.
[10317] <prose> Through this, if diligent in meditation.
[10318] <prose> Without interruption, in three lives.
[10319] <prose> In Buddha mind's mandala.
[10320] <prose> No doubt will become Buddha. || 110 ||
[10321] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10322] <prose> Fourth, though these signs exist, if Dharma is not taken into practice.
[10323] <prose> Beginningless habitual patterns are long heavy.
[10324] <prose> Present non-virtue arises near.
[10325] <prose> Karmic momentum is forceful.
[10326] <prose> Merely from previous signs.
[10327] <prose> Not protecting from that, in the future.
[10328] <prose> Through mixed previous virtue and present various karma.
[10329] <prose> Body sign possessors in form realm.
[10330] <prose> Speech particularly in Brahma class and. || 120 ||
[10331] <prose> Mind sign possessors born as titans.
[10332] <tantra> From that itself.
[10333] <tantra> From interruption here.
[10334] <prose> Result itself is not obtained.
[10335] <tantra> From mind, disturbed abode arises.
[10336] <tantra> From body similarly form realm gods.
[10337] <tantra> From speech in Brahma's abode.
[10338] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10339] <prose> Second, how signs appear now through how speech habituated, also has three aspects.
[10340] <prose> If signs arise, making effort in yoga in three kayas of body, speech, and mind. || 130 ||
[10341] <prose> Liberation obtained in two lives.
[10342] <prose> Otherwise not obtained.
[10343] <prose> The nature of signs and that.
[10344] <tantra> From that itself.
[10345] <prose> Thus in sentient beings too.
[10346] <prose> Previously in Buddha three kayas.
[10347] <prose> As signs of training and habituation.
[10348] <prose> Thus arise, O Dakini.
[10349] <prose> In all Buddhas' body.
[10350] <prose> Whoever habituated previously. || 140 ||
[10351] <prose> Words spoken are forceful and.
[10352] <prose> Without changing from ceasing.
[10353] <prose> This becomes, endowed with fortune.
[10354] <prose> In one time of sun.
[10355] <prose> Thousand verses or.
[10356] <prose> Or four hundred verse meanings.
[10357] <prose> Appear in the mind.
[10358] <prose> Whatever is spoken benefits others.
[10359] <prose> This one previously in body too.
[10360] <prose> Habituated, O Dakini. || 150 ||
[10361] <prose> In all Buddhas' mind too.
[10362] <prose> Whoever habituated in speech.
[10363] <prose> Voice like Brahma's melody.
[10364] <prose> Pleasant to all ears.
[10365] <prose> Even thousand verses.
[10366] <prose> In one day understood in mind and.
[10367] <prose> All sentient beings like servants.
[10368] <prose> This one circling.
[10369] <prose> Previously in Buddha speech too.
[10370] <prose> This one habituated, O Dakini. || 160 ||
[10371] <prose> In Buddhas' mind too.
[10372] <prose> Person who habituated previously.
[10373] <prose> Understanding one word spoken by others.
[10374] <prose> That meaning in that manner.
[10375] <prose> Exactly as it is understood and.
[10376] <prose> In self-spoken words.
[10377] <prose> Without changing, others follow.
[10378] <prose> This one in Buddhas too.
[10379] <prose> Previously habituated, O Dakini.
[10380] <prose> Thus in three kayas of body, speech, and mind. || 170 ||
[10381] <prose> Person who habituated.
[10382] <prose> In two lives becomes Buddha.
[10383] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10384] <prose> Third, how mind signs appearing now through training, if habituated, liberation in mind's expanse in three lives is shown.
[10385] <prose> Also from that itself.
[10386] <prose> In whatever person's mind these signs exist.
[10387] <prose> In Buddha three kayas of body, speech, and mind too.
[10388] <prose> This one habituated, I show.
[10389] <prose> Unlearned meditation self-descending and.
[10390] <prose> Mind naturally obtains spaciousness. || 180 ||
[10391] <prose> This one previously habituated in body.
[10392] <prose> Through thought, dharmas appear in mind and.
[10393] <prose> Previously unseen objects seen and.
[10394] <prose> Previously unheard Dharma words.
[10395] <prose> Naturally knowing.
[10396] <prose> This one previously in Buddha's.
[10397] <prose> Speech habituated, O Dakini.
[10398] <prose> Always abiding alone and.
[10399] <prose> Without fearful mind toward anything and.
[10400] <prose> Person wandering mountains and forests. || 190 ||
[10401] <prose> This one previously in mind too.
[10402] <prose> Habituated, O Dakini.
[10403] <prose> Thus the endowed person.
[10404] <prose> Without interruption practicing truth.
[10405] <prose> In three lives without doubt.
[10406] <prose> In Buddhahood no doubt.
[10407] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10408] <prose> These signs naturally existing in body, speech, and mind from the beginning, through previous life habituation, were clarified.
[10409] <prose> Not reaching the end of that itself.
[10410] <prose> Becoming interruption, appearing in this life. || 200 ||
[10411] <prose> If not effortful here, called uncertain.
[10412] <prose> Through different karmic powers, entering other existence.
[10413] <prose> These signs appearing through thought examination in most beings, birds, deer, dogs, horses, and so forth, also arise through previous training in white three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[10414] <prose> Through black karma, born in lower realm existences.
[10415] <prose> After future, dependent on present actions.
[10416] <prose> Therefore practicing supreme truth Dharma is extremely important.
[10417] <prose> Also from that.
[10418] <prose> Thus in class and non-class.
[10419] <prose> Through previous habituation's force.
[10420] <prose> These signs arise on body. || 210 ||
[10421] <prose> Birds, deer, dogs, and so forth.
[10422] <prose> In animal forms grasped.
[10423] <prose> These signs arise.
[10424] <prose> Previously trained, then interrupted.
[10425] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10426] <prose> Second, explanation of signs of presently entering the path has two aspects.
[10427] <prose> Common general signs to be known and.
[10428] <prose> Uncommon supreme secret path signs to manifest.
[10429] <prose> First has three aspects.
[10430] <prose> Signs of confusion self-miring itself. || 220 ||
[10431] <prose> Signs of uncertainty when pointing-out instruction key points have not directly arrived.
[10432] <prose> Signs of demon interruption when Rigpa is not directly established.
[10433] <prose> First.
[10434] <prose> These arise even in people who have not taken into practice and birds, deer, and so forth.
[10435] <prose> Changing, meaningless, called signs of cause.
[10436] <prose> Second.
[10437] <prose> When common vehicle path is taken into practice and this preliminary training and object-oriented mind, view, meditation, conduct, and result are taken into practice, signs may arise.
[10438] <prose> Therefore explained to know mistaken and non-mistaken branches.
[10439] <tantra> From one hundred sixteen.
[10440] <prose> First, fifty signs arising uncertainly in body, speech, and mind. || 230 ||

[10555] <tantra> As explained in the Blazing Relics Tantra commentary.
[10556] <prose> Third, signs of interruption.
[10557] <prose> Knowing body transforming variously and.
[10558] <prose> Light arising from body and.
[10559] <prose> Sound arising wherever one goes and.
[10560] <prose> Power entering others and. || 350 ||
[10561] <prose> Gathering assemblies and.
[10562] <prose> Remembering adding words to speech and.
[10563] <prose> These are mostly signs of interruption arising for that person.
[10564] <prose> Therefore sitting in water mandala, hanging chin tree stick sixteen finger-widths long.
[10565] <prose> Body anointed with sandalwood oil, coarsely meditating outer and inner things, will be cleared.
[10566] <prose> That power to transform from demonic blessing, if examined, appears as second reflection.
[10567] <prose> Washing body with consecrated water, reciting Phat, meditating on emptiness like space, clears it.
[10568] <prose> Moreover, for whatever yogin, without realizing dharmatā, thinking one has realized.
[10569] <prose> Joyful demon enters.
[10570] <prose> Realizing all as empty, entering partiality, thinking karma and ripening will not harm and. || 360 ||
[10571] <prose> Flesh-eating dakinis giving transmission and.
[10572] <prose> Gathering assemblies and so forth, minor accomplishments arising and.
[10573] <prose> Dakinis conversing, formless sound at ear's edge teaching good and bad, Dharma explaining and so forth coming and.
[10574] <prose> Sometimes subtle clairvoyance arising, with conceit existing and.
[10575] <prose> All these, knowing as demonic interruption, abiding in generation-completion or gathering great accumulations and making aspirations and.
[10576] <prose> Meditating on emptiness causes liberation.
[10577] <tantra> From Self-Arising Rigpa.
[10578] <prose> Playing with words, depth not realized, appearing like crazy ones.
[10579] <prose> Demon of interruption has arisen.
[10580] <prose> Therefore give great accumulations and take into practice. || 370 ||
[10581] <prose> Or if mindfulness is lost, appearance not seen, reverse the three roots.
[10582] <prose> If dakinis giving transmission arise, this is view of experiences, place intent on meaning and.
[10583] <prose> Transmission giving has two aspects.
[10584] <prose> Dakinis coming under one's power and.
