[10211] Liberation and confusion in the intermediate state and future life, and the signs of certainty, are concluded through secret sealing.
[10212] First has three aspects.
[10213] Signs of how previously the body trained in the three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[10214] Signs of how speech habituated.
[10215] Signs of how mind trained.
[10216] First.
[10217] In previous life, training through the body in the three kayas of body, speech, and mind, if interrupted, now showing those signs has four aspects.
[10218] The sequence of signs.
[10219] The suitability of arising.
[10220] The result if habituated. || 10 ||
[10221] If not habituated, certainty is not obtained.
[10222] First.
[10223] From the Glorious Infinite Space Blazing Relics Tantra.
[10224] As the completely enlightened Buddhas.
[10225] Body signs and speech signs.
[10226] Similarly mind vajra signs.
[10227] As previously dawned.
[10228] Here too upon all sentient beings' bodies.
[10229] These will all appear.
[10230] To whom these appear. || 20 ||
[10231] Fortunate ones who trained previously.
[10232] From not ripening previously.
[10233] Now at this time definite result.
[10234] For whomever accomplishes.
[10235] Body signs and similarly speech.
[10236] Mind and so forth, these signs arise.
[10237] Thus it is said.
[10238] Signs of having trained in previous life in Buddha's body, for a man or woman, at the forehead center, clockwise-swirling conch or trident-like crease standing upward and.
[10239] Om marks and.
[10240] Lines or. || 30 ||
[10241] Self-protruding.

[10251] Wheel and.
[10252] Trident's flesh mark or.
[10253] Jewel shape or.
[10254] Syllable form with Hum.
[10255] Second, the suitability of how these signs arise.
[10256] In all beings, from the ground, the three kayas of body, speech, and mind exist in oneself, now appearing through previous training.
[10257] From that itself.
[10258] Even butchers, prostitutes, unfortunate ones.
[10259] From the ground, three kayas of body, speech, and mind exist.
[10260] Therefore through previous habituation. || 50 ||
[10261] For those who entered interruption above.
[10262] The above three kayas of body, speech, and mind signs.
[10263] These arise in all.
[10264] Thus it is said.
[10265] Third, how results are obtained if habituated.
[10266] Through these signs, if effort is made in this life, quickly liberated in three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[10267] Body signs exist, training in body now, in two lives obtaining vajra body.
[10268] Through speech obtaining speech vajra, in two lives accomplishing.
[10269] Through habituation in mind, accomplishing in three.
[10270] The knowledge that establishes certainty of results of signs and habituation. || 60 ||
[10271] From the Blazing Relics Tantra.
[10272] Whoever trains in Sugata body.
[10273] At that one's forehead expanse.
[10274] Conch swirling clockwise or.
[10275] Or trident crease standing upward.
[10276] Similarly also syllable Om.
[10277] Lines or self-protruding.

[10279] Previously trained in Buddha body.
[10280] This yogin who trained. || 70 ||
[10281] Inseparable from Buddha body.
[10282] With confidence at the time.
[10283] Life two will be obtained.
[10284] Without interruption entering this.
[10285] Diligent in meditation itself.
[10286] This is extremely precious.
[10287] In all Buddhas' speech.
[10288] Whoever trained previously.
[10289] To the fortunate one endowed with fortune.
[10290] At that one's throat right and left. || 80 ||
[10291] Eight-petaled lotus or.
[10292] Or conch swirling clockwise.
[10293] Similarly unfurled banner or.
[10294] Hook or sword and.
[10295] Marked by syllable Ah.
[10296] Lines or protruding.
[10297] To whomever exists, that person.
[10298] In all Buddhas' speech too.
[10299] Through this one trained previously.
[10300] In two lives in one speech. || 90 ||
[10301] Definite result will be obtained.
[10302] This too precious without interruption.
[10303] If speech meditation is practiced without interruption.
[10304] Definitely will be obtained without doubt.
[10305] In Buddhas' mind too.
[10306] Whoever habituated previously.
[10307] These signs appear on this body.
[10308] At whose heart place.
[10309] Trident vajra standing upward and.
[10310] Similarly wheel with four spokes or. || 100 ||
[10311] Third stage flesh mark or.
[10312] Jewel shape itself or.
[10313] Hum syllable mark.
[10314] To whom arises, that person.
[10315] In Buddha's mind too.
[10316] This one habituated, endowed with fortune.
[10317] Through this, if diligent in meditation.
[10318] Without interruption, in three lives.
[10319] In Buddha mind's mandala.
[10320] No doubt will become Buddha. || 110 ||
[10321] Thus it is said.
[10322] Fourth, though these signs exist, if Dharma is not taken into practice.
[10323] Beginningless habitual patterns are long heavy.
[10324] Present non-virtue arises near.
[10325] Karmic momentum is forceful.
[10326] Merely from previous signs.
[10327] Not protecting from that, in the future.
[10328] Through mixed previous virtue and present various karma.
[10329] Body sign possessors in form realm.
[10330] Speech particularly in Brahma class and. || 120 ||
[10331] Mind sign possessors born as titans.
[10332] From that itself.
[10333] From interruption here.
[10334] Result itself is not obtained.
[10335] From mind, disturbed abode arises.
[10336] From body similarly form realm gods.
[10337] From speech in Brahma's abode.
[10338] Thus it is said.
[10339] Second, how signs appear now through how speech habituated, also has three aspects.
[10340] If signs arise, making effort in yoga in three kayas of body, speech, and mind. || 130 ||
[10341] Liberation obtained in two lives.
[10342] Otherwise not obtained.
[10343] The nature of signs and that.
[10344] From that itself.
[10345] Thus in sentient beings too.
[10346] Previously in Buddha three kayas.
[10347] As signs of training and habituation.
[10348] Thus arise, O Dakini.
[10349] In all Buddhas' body.
[10350] Whoever habituated previously. || 140 ||
[10351] Words spoken are forceful and.
[10352] Without changing from ceasing.
[10353] This becomes, endowed with fortune.
[10354] In one time of sun.
[10355] Thousand verses or.
[10356] Or four hundred verse meanings.
[10357] Appear in the mind.
[10358] Whatever is spoken benefits others.
[10359] This one previously in body too.
[10360] Habituated, O Dakini. || 150 ||
[10361] In all Buddhas' mind too.
[10362] Whoever habituated in speech.
[10363] Voice like Brahma's melody.
[10364] Pleasant to all ears.
[10365] Even thousand verses.
[10366] In one day understood in mind and.
[10367] All sentient beings like servants.
[10368] This one circling.
[10369] Previously in Buddha speech too.
[10370] This one habituated, O Dakini. || 160 ||
[10371] In Buddhas' mind too.
[10372] Person who habituated previously.
[10373] Understanding one word spoken by others.
[10374] That meaning in that manner.
[10375] Exactly as it is understood and.
[10376] In self-spoken words.
[10377] Without changing, others follow.
[10378] This one in Buddhas too.
[10379] Previously habituated, O Dakini.
[10380] Thus in three kayas of body, speech, and mind. || 170 ||
[10381] Person who habituated.
[10382] In two lives becomes Buddha.
[10383] Thus it is said.
[10384] Third, how mind signs appearing now through training, if habituated, liberation in mind's expanse in three lives is shown.
[10385] Also from that itself.
[10386] In whatever person's mind these signs exist.
[10387] In Buddha three kayas of body, speech, and mind too.
[10388] This one habituated, I show.
[10389] Unlearned meditation self-descending and.
[10390] Mind naturally obtains spaciousness. || 180 ||
[10391] This one previously habituated in body.
[10392] Through thought, dharmas appear in mind and.
[10393] Previously unseen objects seen and.
[10394] Previously unheard Dharma words.
[10395] Naturally knowing.
[10396] This one previously in Buddha's.
[10397] Speech habituated, O Dakini.
[10398] Always abiding alone and.
[10399] Without fearful mind toward anything and.
[10400] Person wandering mountains and forests. || 190 ||
[10401] This one previously in mind too.
[10402] Habituated, O Dakini.
[10403] Thus the endowed person.
[10404] Without interruption practicing truth.
[10405] In three lives without doubt.
[10406] In Buddhahood no doubt.
[10407] Thus it is said.
[10408] These signs naturally existing in body, speech, and mind from the beginning, through previous life habituation, were clarified.
[10409] Not reaching the end of that itself.
[10410] Becoming interruption, appearing in this life. || 200 ||
[10411] If not effortful here, called uncertain.
[10412] Through different karmic powers, entering other existence.
[10413] These signs appearing through thought examination in most beings, birds, deer, dogs, horses, and so forth, also arise through previous training in white three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[10414] Through black karma, born in lower realm existences.
[10415] After future, dependent on present actions.
[10416] Therefore practicing supreme truth Dharma is extremely important.
[10417] Also from that.
[10418] Thus in class and non-class.
[10419] Through previous habituation's force.
[10420] These signs arise on body. || 210 ||
[10421] Birds, deer, dogs, and so forth.
[10422] In animal forms grasped.
[10423] These signs arise.
[10424] Previously trained, then interrupted.
[10425] Thus it is said.
[10426] Second, explanation of signs of presently entering the path has two aspects.
[10427] Common general signs to be known and.
[10428] Uncommon supreme secret path signs to manifest.
[10429] First has three aspects.
[10430] Signs of confusion self-miring itself. || 220 ||
[10431] Signs of uncertainty when pointing-out instruction key points have not directly arrived.
[10432] Signs of demon interruption when Rigpa is not directly established.
[10433] First.
[10434] These arise even in people who have not taken into practice and birds, deer, and so forth.
[10435] Changing, meaningless, called signs of cause.
[10436] Second.
[10437] When common vehicle path is taken into practice and this preliminary training and object-oriented mind, view, meditation, conduct, and result are taken into practice, signs may arise.
[10438] Therefore explained to know mistaken and non-mistaken branches.

[10564] Therefore sitting in water mandala, hanging chin tree stick sixteen finger-widths long.
[10565] Body anointed with sandalwood oil, coarsely meditating outer and inner things, will be cleared.
[10566] That power to transform from demonic blessing, if examined, appears as second reflection.
[10567] Washing body with consecrated water, reciting Phat, meditating on emptiness like space, clears it.
[10568] Moreover, for whatever yogin, without realizing dharmatā, thinking one has realized.
[10569] Joyful demon enters.

[10575] All these, knowing as demonic interruption, abiding in generation-completion or gathering great accumulations and making aspirations and.
[10576] Meditating on emptiness causes liberation.
[10577] From Self-Arising Rigpa.
[10578] Playing with words, depth not realized, appearing like crazy ones.
[10579] Demon of interruption has arisen.
[10580] Therefore give great accumulations and take into practice. || 370 ||
[10581] Or if mindfulness is lost, appearance not seen, reverse the three roots.
[10582] If dakinis giving transmission arise, this is view of experiences, place intent on meaning and.
[10583] Transmission giving has two aspects.
[10584] Dakinis coming under one's power and.
[10585] Self coming under dakinis' power, these two.
[10586] Dakinis coming under one's power is.
[10587] All karma accomplished and actions completed.
[10588] Method for dakinis coming under one's power.
[10589] Son of good family, when taking experiences into practice, if transmission givers arise.
[10590] Without attachment and joy arising toward them. || 380 ||
[10591] If holding them as truly existent.
[10592] This is called dakinis coming under one's power.
[10593] They cannot show any meaning whatsoever.
[10594] Wisdom-pure dakinis do not arise in the world.
[10595] Flesh-eating karma dakinis arise in the world and.
[10596] Those coming to examine practitioners' abodes exist and.
[10597] Through them, without clear form appearance, liberation is not possible.
[10598] Therefore to go beyond to the authentic path.
[10599] Dakinis gave me the life essence heart at one time.
[10600] Self coming under dakinis' power is. || 390 ||
[10601] One's own self truly holding that transmission giver and.
[10602] Always holding that transmission giver and.
[10603] Practicing conduct without attachment to body and.
[10604] Saying crossed beyond result is not result and.
[10605] Following that transmission giver is the near-arising demon of interruption.
[10606] Therefore at that time, know demonic deception.
[10607] Second, uncommon supreme secret signs to manifest has three aspects.
[10608] General explanation of body, speech, and mind signs of previous training.
[10609] Particular explanation of clear light signs of actual training.

[10637] Later cutting birth continuum meaning and.
[10638] Thus this person cut and.
[10639] All these own signs arise.

[10642] Also from that.
[10643] Separating circling and transcendence.
[10644] Previous going body, speech, and mind and.

[10650] Moving in space and. || 440 ||

[10656] Circling thought's binding and.
[10657] Whatever bound, liberated from all and.
[10658] Later body, speech, and mind connected cut and.
[10659] Thus it is said.
[10660] Second, particular explanation of actual signs has two aspects. || 450 ||
[10661] General explanation of view-meditation signs common and.
[10662] Particular explanation of direct clear light signs.
