<ornament> [10211] A Concluding Summation: The Secret Signs Determining Liberation and Delusion in the Bardo and Beyond

<list> [10212] First, three principal topics:
<list> [10213] The signs of how one previously purified body, speech, and mind through the body;
<list> [10214] The signs of how one familiarized through speech;
<list> [10215] The signs of how one trained through mind.

[10216] First:

[10217] Four aspects for demonstrating those signs of purification through the bodily gate to the three—body, speech, and mind—in a former life, now manifesting as obstacles:
<list> [10218] The sequence of signs;
<list> [10219] The suitability of their arising;
<list> [10220] The fruit if familiarized;
<list> [10221] Not obtaining certainty if not familiarized.

[10222] First:

<tantra> [10223] From the Glorious Blazing Relics of the Sky-Born Kāya Tantra:

<verse> [10224] Just as all Perfect Buddhas'
<verse> [10225] Body-signs and speech-signs,
<verse> [10226] Likewise the vajra-mind's signs,
<verse> [10227] As formerly arose,
<verse> [10228] Here also upon all sentient beings' bodies
<verse> [10229] These all shall appear.
<verse> [10230] To whomever these appear,
<verse> [10231] Fortune of previous purification,
<verse> [10232] From former non-ripening,
<verse> [10233] Now the time of certain fruit:
<verse> [10234] To that person accomplishing by whoever,
<verse> [10235] Body-signs and likewise speech,
<verse> [10236] Mind and so forth—these signs arise.
<verse> [10237] Thus it is spoken.

[10238] The signs of purification toward the Buddha-body in a former life: upon the forehead center of a born man or woman—a conch swirling to the right, or a three-pointed frown standing vertical, or any marks of OṀ—lines or existing as self-protrusions.

[10239] OṀ marks,
[10240] Lines, or
[10241] Existing as self-protrusion.

[10242] The signs of purification toward speech: upon the right throat of a born man, or in a woman's left—an eight-petaled lotus, or a conch swirling to the right, or like a silk tongue, or a hook, and a sword, and all marks of AḤ—lines or arising as self-protrusion.

[10243] In a woman's left—an eight-petaled lotus, or
[10244] A conch swirling to the right, or
[10245] Like a silk tongue, or
[10246] A hook, and
[10247] A sword, and
[10248] All marks of AḤ—lines, or
[10249] Arising as self-protrusion.

[10250] The signs of extensive mind: in the heart center—a vajra, and a wheel, and a three-pointed complexion, or a jewel shape, or together with the letter-aspect HŪṀ.

[10251] A wheel, and
[10252] A three-pointed complexion, or
[10253] A jewel shape, or
[10254] Together with the letter-aspect HŪṀ.

[10255] Second, the suitability of those signs arising:

[10256] Now arising by former purification: the three—body, speech, and mind—existing in self from the base in all beings.

<tantra> [10257] From that same source:

<verse> [10258] Also to butcher, prostitute, without fortune:
<verse> [10259] The three—body, speech, mind—exist from the base,
<verse> [10260] Having familiarized before from that,
<verse> [10261] Entering obstacle above,
<verse> [10262] The signs of above body, speech, mind
<verse> [10263] Arise also in all this.
<verse> [10264] Thus it is spoken.

[10265] Third, the manner of obtaining fruit by familiarizing:

[10266] Liberating into the three—body, speech, and mind—quickly if effort is made in this life by possessing those signs.

[10267] Also, if now purifying toward body while possessing body's signs, obtain vajra-body in two lives;

[10268] Accomplishing vajra-speech in two births by speech;

[10269] Accomplishing in three by familiarizing toward mind.

[10270] Determining knowledge of the fruit of sign and familiarizing:

<tantra> [10271] From the Blazing Relics:

<verse> [10272] Who purified to the Sugata-body,
<verse> [10273] Also in that forehead space:
<verse> [10274] A conch swirling to the right,
<verse> [10275] Or a three-pointed frown vertical,
<verse> [10276] Likewise also the letter OṀ,
<verse> [10277] Line or self-protrusion.
<verse> [10278] The person to whom this sign arises:
<verse> [10279] Before purified to Buddha-body,
<verse> [10280] That yogin purifying this,
<verse> [10281] Not separate from Buddha-body,
<verse> [10282] At self-time possessing confidence,
<verse> [10283] Will obtain in two lives.
<verse> [10284] Not entering obstacle to this,
<verse> [10285] Diligent in meditation itself,
<verse> [10286] This itself is very important.

<verse> [10287] To all Buddhas' speech:
<verse> [10288] That person purified before,
<verse> [10289] To fortune-possessing,
<verse> [10290] In that throat's right-left:
<verse> [10291] An eight-petaled lotus, or
<verse> [10292] Or a conch swirling to the right,
<verse> [10293] Likewise extending silk tongue, or
<verse> [10294] A hook, or a sword, and
<verse> [10295] Marked by the letter AḤ,
<verse> [10296] Line itself or protrusion.

<verse> [10297] That person possessing these,
<verse> [10298] To all Buddhas' speech itself,
<verse> [10299] Also by this previously familiarized,
<verse> [10300] In two lives obtains
<verse> [10301] The fruit of certain speech.
<verse> [10302] This too without obstacle is essential.
<verse> [10303] If meditation of unobstructed speech is practiced,
<verse> [10304] Without doubt obtains the certain fruit.

<verse> [10305] To all Buddhas' mind itself:
<verse> [10306] Whoever familiarized before,
<verse> [10307] These signs upon this body.
<verse> [10308] In whose heart-center:
<verse> [10309] A vajra standing vertical with three points,
<verse> [10310] Likewise a wheel with four spokes, or
<verse> [10311] A three-staged complexion,
<verse> [10312] Or the shape of a jewel, or
<verse> [10313] Marked by the letter HŪṀ.
<verse> [10314] The person to whom this arises:
<verse> [10315] To Buddhas' mind itself
<verse> [10316] This one meditated, possessing fortune.
<verse> [10317] If by this one practices meditation diligently,
<verse> [10318] Without interruption, in three lives,
<verse> [10319] Into the Buddha-mind's maṇḍala,
<verse> [10320] Buddha—there is no doubt.
<verse> [10321] Thus it is spoken.

[10322] Fourth: though possessing those signs, if the Dharma is not practiced:

<tantra> [10323] From beginningless continuum of habit-energies,
<verse> [10324] Immediate non-virtue arising near,
<verse> [10325] By karma's force strong,
<verse> [10326] From only possessing former signs,
<verse> [10327] Not protected by that, after,
<verse> [10328] By karma mixed—various former little virtue and now,
<verse> [10329] Sign-possessing body: form realm,
<verse> [10330] Speech: distinction from that—Brahma caste,
<verse> [10331] Sign-possessing mind: birth as demigod.

<tantra> [10332] From that same source:
<verse> [10333] From obstacle in this itself,
<verse> [10334] Not obtaining fruit itself,
<verse> [10335] From mind, mind-disturbing place,
<verse> [10336] From body, likewise form realm god,
<verse> [10337] To speech, Brahma place.
<verse> [10338] Thus it is spoken.

[10339] Second, also to the manner of the three—now signs arising by how familiarized by speech:

[10340] If signs arise, making the diligent yogin toward the three—body, speech, and mind,

[10341] Obtain liberation in two lives,

[10342] Not obtaining otherwise.

[10343] Sign and that nature:

<tantra> [10344] From that same source:
<verse> [10345] Also to all sentient beings like that,
<verse> [10346] To the three Buddha-bodies before,
<verse> [10347] Also as sign of familiarizing and purifying,
<verse> [10348] Thus arise, sky-goer.
<verse> [10349] To all Buddhas' body itself,
<verse> [10350] Of whoever familiarized before,
<verse> [10351] Stable spoken words,
<verse> [10352] Also without change from ceasing.

<tantra> [10353] Also by this transformed with fortune,
<verse> [10354] Like the sun's single time,
<verse> [10355] Or a thousand verses,
<verse> [10356] Or four hundred verse-chanted,
<verse> [10357] Meaning appears to mind.
<verse> [10358] The person speaking benefit to others,
<verse> [10359] By this also previously toward body,
<verse> [10360] Familiarized, O Ḍākinī.
<verse> [10361] Previously to all Buddhas' speech,
<verse> [10362] Whoever familiarized with speech,
<verse> [10363] Voice like Brahma's melody,
<verse> [10364] Pleasant to all ears.
<verse> [10365] A thousand verse-chants,
<verse> [10366] Held in mind in one day,
<verse> [10367] Like all sentient beings,
<verse> [10368] This becomes as companion.
<verse> [10369] Previously to Buddha's speech,
<verse> [10370] This familiarizes, O Ḍākinī.
<verse> [10371] To all Buddhas' mind itself,
<verse> [10372] The person familiarized before,
<verse> [10373] Speaking one word,
<verse> [10374] That meaning as it is,
<verse> [10375] As understood accordingly,
<verse> [10376] And by oneself spoken words,
<verse> [10377] Without change, others inherit.
<verse> [10378] This also to all Buddhas,
<verse> [10379] Previously familiarized, O Ḍākinī.
<verse> [10380] Thus toward body, speech, mind,
<verse> [10381] Whoever is familiarized person,
<verse> [10382] In two lives obtains buddhahood.
<verse> [10383] Thus it is spoken.
<verse> [10384] Third, signs of mind now appearing to mind, if familiarized, in three lives liberation into mind's expanse is shown:

<tantra> [10385] Again from that same source:
<verse> [10386] Whatever being in whose mind possesses these signs,
<verse> [10387] Toward the buddha's kāya, speech, and mind also,
<verse> [10388] By this I teach familiarity.
<verse> [10389] Unlearned meditation self-descends,
<verse> [10390] And the mind obtains ease by its nature.
<verse> [10391] By this, previously familiar with the kāya,
<verse> [10392] Dharmas appear to the mind through thought,
<verse> [10393] And seeing objects not seen before,
<verse> [10394] Words of dharma not heard before
<verse> [10395] Are known as the nature.
<verse> [10396] By this, previously familiar
<verse> [10397] With the buddha's speech, O Ḍākinī,
<verse> [10398] Always dwelling alone,
<verse> [10399] Without fearful mind toward anything,
<verse> [10400] The person roaming mountains and forests—
<verse> [10401] By this, previously also familiar
<verse> [10402] With the mind, O Ḍākinī.
<verse> [10403] Such a person possessing these,
<verse> [10404] If practicing truth without gap,
<verse> [10405] Without obstacle in three lives
<verse> [10406] Will doubtlessly attain buddhahood.
<verse> [10407] Thus it is said.

[10408] These signs, primordially abiding in body, speech, and mind by nature, are clearly sent through familiarity in previous lives.

[10409] Not having reached the end of that very thing,

[10410] Having become an obstacle, they arise in this life.

[10411] Here also, if without effort, it is called uncertain,

[10412] Entering other existences through the power of different karma.

[10413] These signs, through familiarity with mind apprehending and holding meaning, arise in many beings—birds, wild animals,

[10414] Dogs, horses, and so forth—through training the white kāya, speech, and mind in previous lives.

[10415] Born into lower existence beings through black karma,

[10416] From later on depending on present actions,

[10417] Practicing the supreme truth dharma in the present is essential.

<tantra> [10418] Again from that:
<verse> [10419] Thus in family and not family,
<verse> [10420] By the force of previous familiarity,
<verse> [10421] These signs arise in the body.
<verse> [10422] Birds, wild animals, dogs, and so forth,
<verse> [10423] In apprehending animal forms,
<verse> [10424] These signs arise.
<verse> [10425] Previously trained, now obstacles.
<verse> [10426] Thus it is said.

[10427] Second meaning: explaining particular signs of those who have entered the path in the present, in two parts:

<ornament> [10428] Hear now the signs that mark the path of awakening—the common general signs known to all, and the supreme secret signs of the uncommon vehicle, made manifest through direct realization.

[10429] Of the first, there are three aspects:

<list> [10430] Signs of confusion, where mind deceives itself through self-created delusion;
<list> [10431] Signs of failing to reach the essential point of oral instruction, bringing uncertainty;
<list> [10432] Signs of demonic obstacles, when direct awareness remains unseized.

[10433] The first category manifests even in those who have not entered practice—ordinary beings, birds, and wild creatures alike may display these transient transformations, yet they remain meaningless, mere signs of circumstance.

[10434] The second category arises during engagement with common vehicles, through preliminary training, or when conceptual minds undertake view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. To distinguish between deviation and correct path, I shall explain.

[10435] From among the one hundred and sixteen signs, fifty arise in body, speech, and mind with uncertain measure:

<list> [10436] Examination and skill with words, self-arising;
<list> [10437] Knowing others' minds in part;

<list> [10447] Awareness-light radiating immeasurably;
<list> [10448] Lightness of mind;
<list> [10449] Clarity of sense-faculties;
<list> [10450] Great happiness beyond the ordinary;
<list> [10451] Absence of sleep;
<list> [10452] Exceptional joy;
<list> [10453] Increasing awareness;
<list> [10454] Constant desire to sing from the heart;
<list> [10455] Longing to wander;
<list> [10456] Eyes not attaching to others;
<list> [10457] Swiftness of foot;
<list> [10458] Mind expanding into openness;
<list> [10459] Constant transformation of awareness;
<list> [10460] Mind not settling into one-pointedness;
<list> [10461] Fine analysis of words through examination;
<list> [10462] Hearing the voices of ḍākinīs.

[10463] Dwelling with people of borderlands, experiencing their ways;

[10464] Heart trembling always;

[10472] Light emanating from the mouth;

[10473] Feelings of coming and going;

[10474] Knowing emanation of body into animal forms;

[10475] Small relics falling from limbs;

[10476] Behold—gods and asuras appearing to fight;

[10477] Knowing letters and designs previously unknown;

[10478] Sounds emanating from the eyes;

[10479] Able to converse with non-human beings;

[10480] Binding outer winds at will;

[10481] Holding sun and moon in one's grasp;

[10482] Knowing when others' elements will stir;

[10483] Fire sparks emanating from the body;

[10484] Wondrous sounds arising from clapping palms.

[10485] Of dream signs bringing uncertainty, sixty-six in number:

<list> [10487] Listening;
<list> [10488] Reading;

<tantra> [10549] Thus spoke the Blazing Relics Tantra Commentary.

[10550] Of the third, signs of obstacles:

<list> [10551] Knowing emanation of body into various forms;
<list> [10552] Light emanating from the body;
<list> [10553] Sounds arising in whatever direction one goes;
<list> [10554] Power entering others;
<list> [10555] Gatherings assembling;
<list> [10556] Crafting superimpositions of words.

[10557] When these signs greatly manifest in a person, they indicate obstacles arising. In such times, sit in water maṇḍala, insert a sixteen-finger wooden stick into the nape, smear the body with sandalwood oil, and meditate coarsely upon outer and inner things—this certainly dispels.

[10558] When knowing emanation from demonic blessings, examine and see the second reflection. Wash the body with dhāraṇī water, utter PHAṬ, and meditate on emptiness like sky—this dispels.

[10559] Moreover, when a yogin thinks they have realized reality without truly realizing it, demons of bliss enter. Realizing all as empty, entering the profane, thinking action and result cannot harm—know this is demonic deception.

[10560] When flesh-eating ḍākinīs prophesy before one, when gatherings and the like accomplish small siddhis, when ḍākinīs converse and formless sounds speak of good and bad, expound dharma—these come with subtle clairvoyance and conceit.

[10561] Knowing all these as demonic obstacles, dwell in creation-completion or accumulate great merit and make aspirations, or meditate on emptiness—this liberates.

<tantra> [10562] From Awareness Self-Arisen:
<verse> [10563] When engaging mouth-words without realizing depth, becoming like madness—know this is obstacle demon. Abandon great gatherings and enter practice. Or if mindfulness is lost, this is the sign of not seeing vision—reverse the three roots.
<verse> [10564] When ḍākinīs prophesy, this is experience-vision—settle intent upon that.

[10565] Of prophecy, there are two:

<list> [10566] Ḍākinī coming under one's power;
<list> [10567] Self coming under ḍākinī's power.

[10568] When ḍākinī comes under one's power, all actions accomplish and deeds complete.

[10569] The method to bring ḍākinīs under one's power: when prophecy comes during practice, do not generate attachment or joyful mind toward that, do not hold that as true—then ḍākinī comes under one's power.

[10570] That one cannot show any meaning. Wisdom-pure ḍākinīs do not appear in the world. Flesh-eating action ḍākinīs come to the world, inspecting practitioners' places. They cannot liberate because form does not clearly appear.

[10571] For the authentic path, ḍākinīs gave me the life essence at once.

[10572] When self comes under ḍākinī's power, holding that prophecy as true, always holding to that prophecy, conducting oneself without attachment to body, saying one has transcended the extreme of result being or not-being—following that prophecy is obstacle demon approaching.

[10573] Know demonic deception at that time.

[10574] Of the second, uncommon supreme secret signs made manifest—three aspects:

<list> [10575] General showing of body, speech, and mind signs of preliminary training;
<list> [10576] Particular explanation of clear-light signs of main training;
<list> [10577] Expression of other distinctions of signs, grasping the measure of the path.

[10578] Of the first, from three aspects:

<list> [10579] Signs of nose-training of three kāyas, preliminary training of four elements' sound and meaning;
<list> [10580] Signs of mind nose-training, preliminary training measure of body, speech, and mind;
<list> [10581] Signs of awareness nose-training, separating saṃsāra-nirvāṇa border.

<tantra> [10582] From the Blazing Relics:
<verse> [10583] What sounds of elements,
<verse> [10584] Who is familiar with sounds of six races,
<verse> [10585] Elements do not harm this,
<verse> [10586] Likewise fire does not burn,
<verse> [10587] Water does not drown nor carry away,
<verse> [10588] Foot not touching ground,
<verse> [10589] Able to go through mid-space,
<verse> [10590] Wind does not chill nor shake—
<verse> [10591] Thus in whom these arise,
<verse> [10592] Is familiar with four elements' sounds.

[10593] Signs of mind nose-training, preliminary training measure of body, speech, and mind:

<tantra> [10594] From that:
<verse> [10595] Knowing in an instant
<verse> [10596] Beings appearing and not appearing,
<verse> [10597] Because six races do not take form,
<verse> [10598] Know sounds of six beings,
<verse> [10599] Because six beings' mind-continuum is self-cut,
<verse> [10600] Know all their thoughts,
<verse> [10601] Because confusion thought is exhausted—
<verse> [10602] Briefly, six clairvoyances arise,
<verse> [10603] Six beings' appearance
<verse> [10604] Abides in own nature,
<verse> [10605] Cutting later birth-continuum.
<verse> [10606] Thus this person cuts,
<verse> [10607] All these own signs arise.

[10608] Signs of awareness nose-training, separating saṃsāra-nirvāṇa border:

<tantra> [10609] From that also:
<verse> [10610] Before separating saṃsāra-nirvāṇa border,
<verse> [10611] Body, speech, and mind go,
<verse> [10612] Familiar in conduct,
<verse> [10613] Thus tantra signs arise.
<verse> [10614] Body attachment self-reverses,
<verse> [10615] Confusion attachment continuum cuts,
<verse> [10616] No attachment to own body,
<verse> [10617] Conduct in sky,
<verse> [10618] Likewise able to enter ground,
<verse> [10619] Knowing thought and non-thought meaning,
<verse> [10620] Dharma also speaks from mouth.
<verse> [10621] Thus in whom these arise,
<verse> [10622] By body, speech, and mind,
<verse> [10623] Is liberated from all
<verse> [10624] Saṃsāra realization bondage,
<verse> [10625] Later body, speech, mind connection cuts.

[10626] Of the second meaning, particular explanation of main signs—two aspects:

<list> [10627] General showing of common view-meditation signs;
<list> [10628] Particular explanation of direct clear-light signs.

[10629] Of the first:

[10630] View free of extremes, trained like sky, going through sky, circumambulating Jambudvīpa in an instant;

[10631] Solid things dissolving when gazed upon.

[10632] Meditation of self-settled clarity, trained samādhi, wondrous signs of body, speech, and mind arise.

<tantra> [10633] From the Blazing Relics:
<verse> [10634] Signs of familiarity with view:
<verse> [10635] Upon the fortunate person,
<verse> [10636] These likewise arise.
<verse> [10637] Because emptiness expands body and mind,
<verse> [10638] Like ḍākinīs in sky,
<verse> [10639] Turning self-control over wind,
<verse> [10640] Able to travel all Jambudvīpa
<verse> [10641] In six hundred instants like wind,
<verse> [10642] Because own-mind realizes emptiness,
<verse> [10643] Able to dissolve whatever is gazed upon.
<verse> [10644] This gains great confidence in view.

<verse> [10645] Signs of training in meditation:
<verse> [10646] No insects on body,
<verse> [10647] Because compassion completes other benefit,
<verse> [10648] Because concept mind-continuum is empty,
<verse> [10649] Body becomes like cotton,
<verse> [10650] Because awareness possesses deathless meaning,
<verse> [10651] Body becomes like sixteen years passed.
<verse> [10652] Because reality moisture pervades mind,
<verse> [10653] Hair becomes oily.
<verse> [10654] Thus mind does not wander,
<verse> [10655] Sits where placed,
<verse> [10656] Cannot enter confusion objects.
<verse> [10657] This gains meditation oneself,
<verse> [10658] Obtains buddhahood in two lives.
<verse> [10659] These are certain signs of conceptual object beings.

[10660] Of the second, particular explanation of direct clear-light signs—five aspects:

<list> [10661] Light, expanse, bindu, kāya, and awareness trained to measure.

[10662] Of the first, light—five aspects:

<list> [10663] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.

[10664] Light's essence shows awareness tone.

[10665] Definition: appearing clear, therefore light.

[10666] Division: own-characteristic daytime-holding light, wisdom five own-tone, and light of measure of familiarity from practice increasing above direct experience until reaching measure—two aspects.

[10667] Characteristic: self-illuminating without depending on other illuminators.

<verse> [10671] Who is familiar with light,
<verse> [10672] In self-seen activity-field,
<verse> [10673] Earth, water, fire, and wind—
<verse> [10674] Four-elements appearance self-dissolves,
<verse> [10675] Gradually enjoying five colors.
<verse> [10676] Signs not separate from this,
<verse> [10677] In others' seen activity-field,
<verse> [10678] Like madness, obstacle-free,
<verse> [10679] Without attachment to whatever,
<verse> [10680] Transparently penetrating mountain rocks,
<verse> [10681] Likewise appearing to enter ground depths,

<verse> [10683] Body without clothes,
<verse> [10684] Naked, obstacle-free to whatever,
<verse> [10685] Food and desires self-free—

<verse> [10688] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
<verse> [10689] Without doubt obtain result.

[10690] As outer appearance experience-signs,

[10691] So inner awareness arises.

[10692] Signs of nirvāṇa arise when person enters path without error.

<tantra> [10693] From the Self-Arisen:
<verse> [10694] Ride changeless awareness horse,

[10711] Definition: called center, called expanse—the nature of reality things, vast, without end.

[10712] Division: outer expanse sky, inner expanse lamp, secret expanse light and bindu, unsurpassed expanse great appearance of confusion-appearance self-ceasing.

[10714] Characteristic: vast and opening, able to appear, pervading, appearing as clear object, like clear mirror expanse.

[10715] Briefly: not reality thing, produces power to clearly appear as object making reality appear.

[10716] Result: depending on not-mistakenly understanding reality object, seeing reality own essence, making direct non-change into path, buddhahood.

[10717] Familiarizing with such expanse, wondrous outer signs appear as experience.

<tantra> [10718] From the Blazing Relics:
<verse> [10719] Who is familiar with expanse,
<verse> [10720] Outer-inner breath movement ceases,
<verse> [10721] Goes like bird in sky,
<verse> [10722] Likewise like fish in water—

<verse> [10731] From this in sixteen months,
<verse> [10732] Dharma-expanse also sees.

[10733] Inner experience-signs:

<verse> [10749] Not hating ugly forms,
<verse> [10750] Perception of food and drink not arising through samādhi power,
