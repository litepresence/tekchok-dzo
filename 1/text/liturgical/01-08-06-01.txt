[10775] First: regarding the two dispute-responses.
[10776] The dispute:
[10777] The response to those who say "it follows as an eighth ground" is: one recognizes primordial purity and unceasing display to be non-dual, thus one does not wish to turn away from the gathering of the seven aspects.
[10778] Therefore, there is no fault of following as an eighth ground.
[10779] Moreover, this does not contradict "one's own face is primordially pure,"
[10780] Because one recognizes the essence to be primordially pure—there is connection.
[10781] Second: regarding the dispute and response to those who say primordial purity and unceasing display are non-dual in one's own face.
