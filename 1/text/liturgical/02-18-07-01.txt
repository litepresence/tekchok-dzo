[4747] Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[4748] When dust and rain removed,  Press direct main-point, expert,  Make inner lamp the path.  Thus it was said.  That also: outer awareness dawning field;  Inner: experience increasing field.  Awareness and experience, from two not existing,  Called samsara-nirvana mixed.  That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—  Gaze at field, not liberate.  First: not desire vision dawn;  Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,  Knowing also compatible with that arises,  Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.


### PAGE 107

[4749] Gaze awareness at sky empty—
[4750] Field compatible with sky, experience empty,
[4751] Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
[4752] Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
[4753] From Mind Section:
[4754] Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.
[4755] Thus said, and:
[4756] From Collection:
[4757] Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.
[4758] Thus said, and:
[4759] From Middle Mother:
[4760] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4761] Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.
[4762] That also: field outer-inner mixed,
[4763] Called equal limitless view;
[4764] Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
[4765] Called dhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana taste equal view.
[4766] This same, from Instruction-Child also:
[4767] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
[4768] Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.
[4769] Thus spoken.
[4770] Third, wind-awareness main-point:
[4771] When field and gate two meet,
[4772] Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
[4773] That also: somehow slow wind,
[4774] Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.
[4775] That also: wind and slow cause—
[4776] Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper;
[4777] Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
[4778] Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
[4779] Actual: make buddha, not seeing contaminated.
[4780] That thus, also from Thalgyur:
[4781] Make wind somehow slow,
[4782] Arising from fully projecting,
[4783] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4784] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4785] Thus said, and:
[4786] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom,
[4787] Arising from fully projecting,
[4788] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4789] Not reversing even in three realms.  Thus said, and:  Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.  Thus it was said.  Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.


### PAGE 108

[4790] From that same:
[4791] Self-face awareness hanging-cord,
[4792] Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.
[4793] Thus said, and:
[4794] From Instruction-Child:
[4795] Hanging-cord inside dhatu,
[4796] Arrange place, do not separate.
[4797] Thus it was said.
[4798] That also: relying on slow wind,
[4799] Action separate meaning arises in mind;
[4800] Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead,
[4801] Conceptuality source exhausted from;
[4802] Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.
[4803] Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—
[4804] Self-arisen awareness enters.
[4805] That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,
[4806] Do five-six days;
[4807] Then practice gate, only that much;
[4808] Then seek field, do six-seven days;
[4809] Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.
[4810] That: very purified, meditation knowing arises;
[4811] Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,
[4812] No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.
[4813] Various divinations arise near,
[4814] Therefore make pure those not gone thus.
[4815] That: general, when apply great guide,  Preliminary measure arrives,  Purify with diligence,  Actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises.  Actual main: hit point-delivery,  Direct delight, special arises.  Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut,  Knowing capable of maintaining experience practice,  Doubt and conceptuality end,  Purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma.  Second: introduce awareness self-face directly:  Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like,  With dhatu luminous-clear vision—  This, not-deluded buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.  Look at state: all concept-doers pure,  Elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within—  Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent,  Meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.


### PAGE 109

[4816] First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.
[4817] When this habituation arrives at measure—
[4818] Liberating with stone into light;
[4819] If not arrived, traverse bardo
[4820] Or nature-emanation field;
[4821] Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.
[4822] Thus introduce, and:
[4823] From Self-Arising Instruction:
[4824] Thus, whoever sees—this person,
[4825] First Samantabhadra,
[4826] Capacity itself is equal.
[4827] Thus said, and:
[4828] From Thalgyur:
[4829] Hanging-cord nature is:
[4830] By all conceptuality pure,
[4831] Base-buddha, not deluded.
[4832] Thus it was said.
[4833] Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:
[4834] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
[4835] Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
[4836] From first white-pure star-scatter like,
[4837] Point possessing five colors,
[4838] Each one,
[4839] Three-bind interval vision until that.
[4840] From previous:
[4841] Then see point.
[4842] Thus it was said.
[4843] That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
[4844] Inner conceptuality separate,
[4845] Equal limitless liberating;
[4846] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance,
[4847] And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
[4848] Two—outer-inner pair connect;
[4849] Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.
[4850] Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:
[4851] Briefly show essence,
[4852] Extensively explain nature.
[4853] First: when all four visions,
[4854] Body abiding in posture,
[4855] Eye gazing at gaze manner,
[4856] Wind-awareness mode slow,
[4857] Three main-points harmonize.  Particularly: first two visions purify,  Later two not relying on effort,  Mode purify,  Liberate into luminous-clear,  Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual.  These main-points: arise from not doing—  Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.  Explain that meaning:  Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable,  Base-abide and that resonance,  From light channel pure vision,  Like golden thread coil,  Curve interval point bind.  Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings,  Essence not existing good-bad,  Equal, unchanging,  Place in abiding part.

[4858] Lu: like good water channel,
[4859] Water emerges without increase or decrease.
[4860] Body and wisdom increase-opening,
[4861] Various path-visions until complete,
[4862] From that, dawning cause.
[4863] Gu: inside that,
[4864] Pull not-mistaken dharmata view and meditation.
[4865] Rgyud: pervading samsara-nirvana,
[4866] From those vision collections,
[4867] Body and
[4868] Point radiating and
[4869] Arising and
[4870] Gathering etcetera, clear cause.
[4871] From Thalgyur:
[4872] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
[4873] From that, vision becomes four:
[4874] By dharmata direct vision,
[4875] Suppress intellect-grasping view;
[4876] By experience-vision increasing above,
[4877] Cause delusion vision to cease;
[4878] By awareness measure-arriving vision,
[4879] Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
[4880] By dharmata exhausting vision,
[4881] Cut three-realms' samsara stream.
[4882] Thus it was said.
[4883] That also: vision four number determined—
[4884] Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
[4885] Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
[4886] Secret: showing empowerment four determination;
[4887] Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.
[4888] Sequence determined:
[4889] First, base dharmata direct not see,
[4890] Remaining three dawning base not existing—  Basis and supported base,  First: dharmata direct vision dawning.  That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning,  Called self-arisen wisdom self-found.  Then: direct that, if not experience experience,  Word only, fruit not arise;  Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.  Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;  If not firm, experience no end,  Not possessing dharmas,  Buddha not arising cause;  Arrive at firm experience measure cause.


### PAGE 111

[4891] Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.
[4892] Though awareness vision arrives at measure,
[4893] If not changing from that to other,
[4894] Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
[4895] Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit
[4896] From actual vision-mark dharmas.
[4897] Vision-experience dissolves into base;
[4898] Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;
[4899] Experience dharmata exhaustion,
[4900] Dharmata-exhausting vision arises.
[4901] Those also: first two—nirmanakaya;
[4902] Measure-arriving—sambhogakaya;
[4903] Exhausting—dharmakaya vision.
[4904] Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn,
[4905] Arrive at fruit dharmata-exhausting pure dhatu—cause.
[4906] Self-vision potency dissolves
[4907] Into three-bodies' awareness mode;
[4908] Awareness pure fruit,
[4909] Originally from awareness dhatu,
[4910] Self-potency three-bodies dawn,
[4911] Called functioning fruit.
[4912] Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;
[4913] Vehicle king: called intent.
[4914] This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.
[4915] Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are:
