[4747] <prose>First: not desiring vision to dawn;</prose>
[4748] <prose>Later when dawned: definite, like coarse entity, knowing also compatible with that arises, emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.</prose>
[4749] <prose>Gaze awareness at sky empty—</prose>
[4750] <prose>Field compatible with sky, experience empty, clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.</prose>
[4751] <prose>Entity separate from characteristic: purpose exists.</prose>
[4752] <tantra>From the Mind Section:</tantra>
[4753] <verse>Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.</verse>
[4754] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4755] <tantra>From the Collection: || 10 ||</tantra>
[4756] <verse>Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.</verse>
[4757] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4758] <tantra>From the Middle Mother:</tantra>
[4759] <verse>Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation</verse>
[4760] <verse>Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.</verse>
[4761] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4762] <prose>That also: field outer-inner mixed, called equal limitless view;</prose>
[4763] <prose>Called dhātu-awareness non-dual view;</prose>
[4764] <prose>Called dhātu-awareness mixed, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa taste equal view.</prose>
[4765] <prose>This same, from the Instruction-Child also: || 20 ||</prose>
[4766] <verse>Dhātu and awareness gaze manner,</verse>
[4767] <verse>Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.</verse>
[4768] <tantra>Thus spoken.</tantra>
[4769] <ornament>Third, wind-awareness main-point:</ornament>
[4770] <prose>When field and gate two meet, rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.</prose>
[4771] <prose>That also: somehow slow wind, shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.</prose>
[4772] <prose>That also: wind and slow cause—</prose>
[4773] <prose>Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper; || 30 ||</prose>
[4774] <prose>Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;</prose>
[4775] <prose>Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;</prose>
[4776] <prose>Actual: make Buddha, not seeing contaminated.</prose>
[4777] <prose>That thus, also from Thalgyur:</prose>
[4778] <verse>Make wind somehow slow,</verse>
[4779] <verse>Arising from fully projecting,</verse>
[4780] <verse>Body and mind connection cut that,</verse>
[4781] <verse>Not reversing even in three realms.</verse>
[4782] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4783] <verse>Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom, || 40 ||</verse>
[4784] <verse>Arising from fully projecting,</verse>
[4785] <verse>Body and mind connection cut that,</verse>
[4786] <verse>Not reversing even in three realms.</verse>
[4787] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4788] <verse>Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.</verse>
[4789] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4790] <prose>Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhātu fence, make not move.</prose>
[4791] <tantra>From that same:</tantra>
[4792] <verse>Self-face awareness hanging-cord,</verse>
[4793] <verse>Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.</verse>
[4794] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4795] <tantra>From the Instruction-Child:</tantra>
[4796] <verse>Hanging-cord inside dhātu, || 50 ||</verse>
[4797] <verse>Arrange place, do not separate.</verse>
[4798] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4799] <prose>That also: relying on slow wind, action separate meaning arises in mind;</prose>
[4800] <prose>Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead,</prose>
[4801] <prose>Conceptuality source exhausted from;</prose>
[4802] <prose>Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.</prose>
[4803] <prose>Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—</prose>
[4804] <prose>Self-arisen awareness enters.</prose>
[4805] <prose>That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,</prose>
[4806] <prose>Do five-six days; || 60 ||</prose>
[4807] <prose>Then practice gate, only that much;</prose>
[4808] <prose>Then seek field, do six-seven days;</prose>
[4809] <prose>Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.</prose>
[4810] <prose>That: very purified, meditation knowing arises;</prose>
[4811] <prose>Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,</prose>
[4812] <prose>No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.</prose>
[4813] <prose>Various divinations arise near,</prose>
[4814] <prose>Therefore make pure those not gone thus.</prose>
[4815] <prose>That: general, when apply great guide, preliminary measure arrives, purify with diligence, actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises. Actual main: hit point-delivery, direct delight, special arises. Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut, knowing capable of maintaining experience practice, doubt and conceptuality end, purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma. || 70 ||</prose>
[4816] <ornament>Second: introduce awareness self-face directly:</ornament>
[4817] <prose>Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like, with dhātu luminous-clear vision—this, not-deluded Buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.</prose>
[4818] <prose>Look at state: all concept-doers pure, elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within—dhātu-awareness non-dual intent, meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.</prose>
[4819] <prose>First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.</prose>
[4820] <prose>When this habituation arrives at measure—liberating with stone into light;</prose>
[4821] <prose>If not arrived, traverse bardo or nature-emanation field;</prose>
[4822] <prose>Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.</prose>
[4823] <prose>Thus introduce, and: || 80 ||</prose>
[4824] <tantra>From the Self-Arising Instruction:</tantra>
[4825] <verse>Thus, whoever sees—this person,</verse>
[4826] <verse>First Samantabhadra,</verse>
[4827] <verse>Capacity itself is equal.</verse>
[4828] <tantra>Thus said, and:</tantra>
[4829] <tantra>From Thalgyur:</tantra>
[4830] <verse>Hanging-cord nature is:</verse>
[4831] <verse>By all conceptuality pure,</verse>
[4832] <verse>Base-Buddha, not deluded.</verse>
[4833] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4834] <ornament>Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:</ornament>
[4835] <prose>Dhātu light five self-resonance luster dawning, bind tiny point to hanging-cord, from first white-pure star-scatter like, || 90 ||</prose>
[4836] <prose>Point possessing five colors,</prose>
[4837] <prose>Each one,</prose>
[4838] <prose>Three-bind interval vision until that.</prose>
[4839] <tantra>From previous:</tantra>
[4840] <verse>Then see point.</verse>
[4841] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4842] <prose>That also: look at outer luminous-clear,</prose>
[4843] <prose>Inner conceptuality separate,</prose>
[4844] <prose>Equal limitless liberating;</prose>
[4845] <prose>Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance, || 100 ||</prose>
[4846] <prose>And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,</prose>
[4847] <prose>Two—outer-inner pair connect;</prose>
[4848] <prose>Called dhātu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.</prose>
[4849] <ornament>Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:</ornament>
[4850] <list>Briefly show essence,</list>
[4851] <list>Extensively explain nature.</list>
[4852] <ornament>First:</ornament>
[4853] <prose>When all four visions, body abiding in posture,</prose>
[4854] <prose>Eye gazing at gaze manner,</prose>
[4855] <prose>Wind-awareness mode slow, || 110 ||</prose>
[4856] <prose>Three main-points harmonize.</prose>
[4857] <prose>Particularly: first two visions purify, later two not relying on effort, mode purify, liberate into luminous-clear, therefore called dhātu-awareness non-dual.</prose>
[4858] <prose>These main-points: arise from not doing—separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.</prose>
[4859] <prose>Explain that meaning:</prose>
[4860] <prose>Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable, base-abide and that resonance, from light channel pure vision, like golden thread coil, curve interval point bind.</prose>
[4861] <prose>Vajra: all Buddhas and sentient beings, essence not existing good-bad, equal, unchanging, place in abiding part.</prose>
[4862] <prose>Lu: like good water channel, water emerges without increase or decrease.</prose>
[4863] <prose>Body and wisdom increase-opening, various path-visions until complete, from that, dawning cause.</prose>
[4864] <prose>Gu: inside that, pull not-mistaken dharmatā view and meditation.</prose>
[4865] <prose>Rgyud: pervading saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, from those vision collections, || 120 ||</prose>
[4866] <prose>Body and point radiating and arising and gathering etcetera, clear cause.</prose>
[4867] <tantra>From Thalgyur:</tantra>
[4868] <verse>Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;</verse>
[4869] <verse>From that, vision becomes four:</verse>
[4870] <verse>By dharmatā direct vision,</verse>
[4871] <verse>Suppress intellect-grasping view;</verse>
[4872] <verse>By experience-vision increasing above, || 130 ||</verse>
[4873] <verse>Cause delusion vision to cease;</verse>
[4874] <verse>By awareness measure-arriving vision,</verse>
[4875] <verse>Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;</verse>
[4876] <verse>By dharmatā exhausting vision,</verse>
[4877] <verse>Cut three-realms' saṃsāra stream.</verse>
[4878] <tantra>Thus it was said.</tantra>
[4879] <prose>That also: vision four number determined—</prose>
[4880] <prose>Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;</prose>
[4881] <prose>Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;</prose>
[4882] <prose>Secret: showing empowerment four determination; || 140 ||</prose>
[4883] <prose>Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.</prose>
[4884] <ornament>Sequence determined:</ornament>
[4885] <prose>First, base dharmatā direct not see, remaining three dawning base not existing—basis and supported base, first: dharmatā direct vision dawning.</prose>
[4886] <prose>That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning, called self-arisen wisdom self-found.</prose>
[4887] <prose>Then: direct that, if not experience experience, word only, fruit not arise;</prose>
[4888] <prose>Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.</prose>
[4889] <prose>Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;</prose>
[4890] <prose>If not firm, experience no end, not possessing dharmas, Buddha not arising cause; arrive at firm experience measure cause. || 150 ||</prose>
[4891] <prose>Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.</prose>
[4892] <prose>Though awareness vision arrives at measure, if not changing from that to other,</prose>
[4893] <prose>Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,</prose>
[4894] <prose>Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit from actual vision-mark dharmas.</prose>
[4895] <prose>Vision-experience dissolves into base;</prose>
[4896] <prose>Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;</prose>
[4897] <prose>Experience dharmatā exhaustion, dharmatā-exhausting vision arises.</prose>
[4898] <prose>Those also: first two—Nirmāṇakāya;</prose>
[4899] <prose>Measure-arriving—Saṃbhogakāya;</prose>
[4900] <prose>Exhausting—Dharmakāya vision. || 160 ||</prose>
[4901] <prose>Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn, arrive at fruit dharmatā-exhausting pure dhātu—cause.</prose>
[4902] <prose>Self-vision potency dissolves into three-bodies' awareness mode;</prose>
[4903] <prose>Awareness pure fruit, originally from awareness dhātu,</prose>
[4904] <prose>Self-potency three-bodies dawn, called functioning fruit.</prose>
[4905] <prose>Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;</prose>
[4906] <prose>Vehicle king: called intent.</prose>
[4907] <prose>This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.</prose>
[4908] <ornament>Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are:</ornament>
[4909] <list>Dharmatā direct,</list>
[4910] <list>Experience above increase,</list>
[4911] <list>Awareness measure arrive,</list>
[4912] <list>Dharmatā exhaust vision extensively explain. || 170 ||</list>
