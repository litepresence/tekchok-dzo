[4747] <prose> Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[4748] <prose> When dust and rain removed,  Press direct main-point, expert,  Make inner lamp the path.  Thus it was said.  That also: outer awareness dawning field;  Inner: experience increasing field.  Awareness and experience, from two not existing,  Called saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed.  That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—  Gaze at field, not liberate.  First: not desire vision dawn;  Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,  Knowing also compatible with that arises,  Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
[4749] <prose> Gaze awareness at sky empty—
[4750] <prose> Field compatible with sky, experience empty,
[4751] <prose> Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
[4752] <prose> Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
[4753] <prose><tantra> From Mind Section:
[4754] <prose> Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.
[4755] <prose> Thus said, and:
[4756] <prose><tantra> From Collection: || 10 ||
[4757] <prose> Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.
[4758] <prose> Thus said, and:
[4759] <prose><tantra> From Middle Mother:
[4760] <prose> Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4761] <prose> Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.
[4762] <prose> That also: field outer-inner mixed,
[4763] <prose> Called equal limitless view;
[4764] <prose> Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
[4765] <prose> Called dhatu-awareness mixed, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa taste equal view.
[4766] <prose> This same, from Instruction-Child also: || 20 ||
[4767] <prose> Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
[4768] <prose> Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.
[4769] <prose> Thus spoken.
[4770] <prose> Third, wind-awareness main-point:
[4771] <prose> When field and gate two meet,
[4772] <prose> Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
[4773] <prose> That also: somehow slow wind,
[4774] <prose> Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.
[4775] <prose> That also: wind and slow cause—
[4776] <prose> Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper; || 30 ||
[4777] <prose> Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
[4778] <prose> Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
[4779] <prose> Actual: make Buddha, not seeing contaminated.
[4780] <prose> That thus, also from Thalgyur:
[4781] <prose> Make wind somehow slow,
[4782] <prose> Arising from fully projecting,
[4783] <prose> Body and mind connection cut that,
[4784] <prose> Not reversing even in three realms.
[4785] <prose> Thus said, and:
[4786] <prose> Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom, || 40 ||
[4787] <prose> Arising from fully projecting,
[4788] <prose> Body and mind connection cut that,
[4789] <prose> Not reversing even in three realms.  Thus said, and:  Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.  Thus it was said.  Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.
[4790] <prose><tantra> From that same:
[4791] <prose> Self-face awareness hanging-cord,
[4792] <prose> Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.
[4793] <prose> Thus said, and:
[4794] <prose><tantra> From Instruction-Child:
[4795] <prose> Hanging-cord inside dhatu,
[4796] <prose> Arrange place, do not separate. || 50 ||
[4797] <prose> Thus it was said.
[4798] <prose> That also: relying on slow wind,
[4799] <prose> Action separate meaning arises in mind;
[4800] <prose> Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead,
[4801] <prose> Conceptuality source exhausted from;
[4802] <prose> Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.
[4803] <prose> Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—
[4804] <prose> Self-arisen awareness enters.
[4805] <prose> That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,
[4806] <prose> Do five-six days; || 60 ||
[4807] <prose> Then practice gate, only that much;
[4808] <prose> Then seek field, do six-seven days;
[4809] <prose> Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.
[4810] <prose> That: very purified, meditation knowing arises;
[4811] <prose> Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,
[4812] <prose> No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.
[4813] <prose> Various divinations arise near,
[4814] <prose> Therefore make pure those not gone thus.
[4815] <prose> That: general, when apply great guide,  Preliminary measure arrives,  Purify with diligence,  Actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises.  Actual main: hit point-delivery,  Direct delight, special arises.  Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut,  Knowing capable of maintaining experience practice,  Doubt and conceptuality end,  Purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma.  Second: introduce awareness self-face directly:  Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like,  With dhatu luminous-clear vision—  This, not-deluded Buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.  Look at state: all concept-doers pure,  Elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within—  Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent,  Meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.
[4816] <prose> First Samantabhadra, equal capacity. || 70 ||
[4817] <prose> When this habituation arrives at measure—
[4818] <prose> Liberating with stone into light;
[4819] <prose> If not arrived, traverse bardo
[4820] <prose> Or nature-emanation field;
[4821] <prose> Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.
[4822] <prose> Thus introduce, and:
[4823] <prose><tantra> From Self-Arising Instruction:
[4824] <prose> Thus, whoever sees—this person,
[4825] <prose> First Samantabhadra,
[4826] <prose> Capacity itself is equal. || 80 ||
[4827] <prose> Thus said, and:
[4828] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[4829] <prose> Hanging-cord nature is:
[4830] <prose> By all conceptuality pure,
[4831] <prose> Base-Buddha, not deluded.
[4832] <prose> Thus it was said.
[4833] <ornament> Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:
[4834] <prose> Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
[4835] <prose> Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
[4836] <prose><tantra> From first white-pure star-scatter like, || 90 ||
[4837] <prose> Point possessing five colors,
[4838] <prose> Each one,
[4839] <prose> Three-bind interval vision until that.
[4840] <prose><tantra> From previous:
[4841] <prose> Then see point.
[4842] <prose> Thus it was said.
[4843] <prose> That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
[4844] <prose> Inner conceptuality separate,
[4845] <prose> Equal limitless liberating;
[4846] <prose> Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance, || 100 ||
[4847] <prose> And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
[4848] <prose> Two—outer-inner pair connect;
[4849] <prose> Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.
[4850] <ornament> Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:
[4851] <prose> Briefly show essence,
[4852] <prose> Extensively explain nature.
[4853] <ornament> First: when all four visions,
[4854] <prose> Body abiding in posture,
[4855] <prose> Eye gazing at gaze manner,
[4856] <prose> Wind-awareness mode slow, || 110 ||
[4857] <prose> Hence, three main-points harmonize.  Particularly: first two visions purify,  Later two not relying on effort,  Mode purify,  Liberate into luminous-clear,  Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual.  These main-points: arise from not doing—  Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.  Explain that meaning:  Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable,  Base-abide and that resonance,  From light channel pure vision,  Like golden thread coil,  Curve interval point bind.  Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings,  Essence not existing good-bad,  Equal, unchanging,  Place in abiding part.
[4858] <prose> Lu: like good water channel,
[4859] <prose> Water emerges without increase or decrease.
[4860] <prose> Body and wisdom increase-opening,
[4861] <prose> Various path-visions until complete,
[4862] <prose><tantra> From that, dawning cause.
[4863] <prose> Gu: inside that,
[4864] <prose> Pull not-mistaken dharmatā view and meditation.
[4865] <prose> Rgyud: pervading saṃsāra-nirvāṇa,
[4866] <prose><tantra> From those vision collections, || 120 ||
[4867] <prose> Body and
[4868] <prose> Point radiating and
[4869] <prose> Arising and
[4870] <prose> Gathering etcetera, clear cause.
[4871] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[4872] <prose> Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
[4873] <prose><tantra> From that, vision becomes four:
[4874] <prose> By dharmatā direct vision,
[4875] <prose> Suppress intellect-grasping view;
[4876] <prose> By experience-vision increasing above, || 130 ||
[4877] <prose> Cause delusion vision to cease;
[4878] <prose> By awareness measure-arriving vision,
[4879] <prose> Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
[4880] <prose> By dharmatā exhausting vision,
[4881] <prose> Cut three-realms' saṃsāra stream.
[4882] <prose> Thus it was said.
[4883] <prose> That also: vision four number determined—
[4884] <prose> Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
[4885] <prose> Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
[4886] <prose> Secret: showing empowerment four determination; || 140 ||
[4887] <prose> Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.
[4888] <prose> Sequence determined:
[4889] <prose> First, base dharmatā direct not see,
[4890] <prose> Remaining three dawning base not existing—  Basis and supported base,  First: dharmatā direct vision dawning.  That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning,  Called self-arisen wisdom self-found.  Then: direct that, if not experience experience,  Word only, fruit not arise;  Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.  Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;  If not firm, experience no end,  Not possessing dharmas,  Buddha not arising cause;  Arrive at firm experience measure cause.
[4891] <prose> Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.
[4892] <prose> Though awareness vision arrives at measure,
[4893] <prose> If not changing from that to other,
[4894] <prose> Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
[4895] <prose> Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit
[4896] <prose><tantra> From actual vision-mark dharmas. || 150 ||
[4897] <prose> Vision-experience dissolves into base;
[4898] <prose> Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;
[4899] <prose> Experience dharmatā exhaustion,
[4900] <prose> dharmatā-exhausting vision arises.
[4901] <prose> Those also: first two—Nirmāṇakāya;
[4902] <prose> Measure-arriving—Sambhogakāya;
[4903] <prose> Exhausting—Dharmakāya vision.
[4904] <prose> Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn,
[4905] <prose> Arrive at fruit dharmatā-exhausting pure dhatu—cause.
[4906] <prose> Self-vision potency dissolves || 160 ||
[4907] <prose> Into three-bodies' awareness mode;
[4908] <prose> Awareness pure fruit,
[4909] <prose> Originally from awareness dhatu,
[4910] <prose> Self-potency three-bodies dawn,
[4911] <prose> Called functioning fruit.
[4912] <prose> Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;
[4913] <prose> Vehicle king: called intent.
[4914] <prose> This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.
[4915] <ornament> Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are:
