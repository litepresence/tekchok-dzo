[3341] First: The basis, cause of clarity.
[3342] The mind itself is the ultimate, free from elaboration, great distinguished, without effort—the great itself.
[3343] That essence: The basis mind and gold and its color—neither are dual.
[3344] Relying on the divisions of analyzed basis names, establishing definite situations.
[3345] The basis to be accomplished, accomplishing—realizing near the mind's characteristics.
[3346] That also distinguished by the concentration of basis abiding and self-liberation.

[3349] Accomplishing through accomplishment.

[3352] Through relying on the stages of arising of the harmonious yoga path.

[3354] Wishing for self-liberated realization.
[3355] Clarifying the result.
[3356] The ripened mind's result appears variously and liberates variously.
[3357] Called self-arisen primordial wisdom.
[3358] The ripened result of reality, without effort or establishment.
[3359] Called the all-knowing primordial wisdom of all Buddha aspects.
[3360] Also this: Relying on the basis to be accomplished, accomplishing, the path accomplishing is evident—thus called great realization yoga.
[3361] The result: Self-accomplished, called the pure primordial wisdom of Buddha's mind.
[3362] The tradition of wishing the main accomplishment:
[3363] Divided: Accomplishing body, carrying to the path of Manjushri's mandala wheel.
[3364] Accomplishing speech, making Buddha of the lotus family.
[3365] Accomplishing mind, making Buddha of the heruka vajra family.
[3366] Accomplishing qualities, making Buddha of the jewel family.
[3367] Accomplishing activity, accomplishing Buddha of the karma family.
[3368] The essence of these:
[3369] Accomplishing each deity through three concentrations without duality.
[3370] The etymology:
[3371] Relying on accomplishment, manifesting the accomplishment of one hero's mandala wheel.
[3372] The purpose.
[3373] Accomplishing the path, manifesting the result.
[3374] The result:

[3381] The main completion stage.
[3382] The main union.
[3383] And wishing the incomplete.



[3384] Partial pieces, wishing, and so forth—many.
[3385] From the two upadeśas.
[3386] Accomplishing through the svātma upadeśa with mind as main and branches.
[3387] Accomplishing through the maṇḍala upadeśa with entry into mandala.
[3388] Also this pindārtha.
[3389] Relying on the divisions of manifest realization deity.
[3390] The essence of these: Only conventional, in the correct conventional time, looking at the outer container world palace.
[3391] Looking at the mandala of supporting sentient beings as deities and goddesses.
[3392] Seeing all beings as forms of deities and goddesses.
[3393] Killing the life of commitment deities.

[3396] Not establishing anything as ultimate essence.
[3397] Not going to the true freedom.
[3398] Realizing indivisible union.
[3399] Surpassing the outer.
[3400] In ultimate truth, no deity exists, no entities or signs.

[3407] Purifying meaning upon the pure expanse of basis nature.
[3408] Purifying aggregates, elements, and grasping, etc.

[3410] The purified result: Body and primordial wisdom, not even establishing—realizing.
[3411] These also:
[3412] From self-arisen awareness.
[3413] Alas, the secret lord is definitely held.
[3414] The established view of mahā is thus.
[3415] The door of entry is the three concentrations.
[3416] The view of realization: Whatever appears, realize as deity.
[3417] The root samaya: Body, speech, mind.
[3418] The result: Means and wisdom, not separate.
[3419] The three concentrations are thus.
[3420] The concentration of suchness.
[3421] Free from thought, crystal clarity.
[3422] All-illuminating concentration.
[3423] Meditating without distraction, clearly.
[3424] Likewise, the concentration of cause.
[3425] Meditating on the three-stacked being from Hūṃ.
[3426] The self, samaya, being.

[3428] The concentration of syllable and letter being.
[3429] Endowed with the three clear aspects.
[3430] The two primordial wisdom beings.
[3431] Peaceful and wrathful.



[3432] The cause concentration is thus.
[3433] yaṃ and rāṃ and khāṃ.
[3434] rā and sū and kāṃ.
[3435] pāṃ and sā and mā.
[3436] hūṃ and phaṭ, etc.
[3437] Syllable letters, light rays—inconceivable.
[3438] Emanating, endowed with pride.
[3439] The deity of aspects and emptiness.
[3440] That is the three concentrations.
[3441] The three samayas are thus.
[3442] Abandoning the killing of life through the body door.
[3443] Stealing and sexual misconduct.
[3444] Abandoning lies and slander through the speech door.
[3445] Abandoning harsh speech and idle talk.
[3446] Abandoning covetousness and harmful intent through the mind door.
[3447] Completely abandoning wrong view.
[3448] Realizing means and wisdom as non-separate.
[3449] Thus the established view of mahāyoga is wished.
[3450] Thus.
[3451] Eighth: The scripture anuyoga vehicle.
[3452] Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual, free from elaboration, not abiding in any extreme.
[3453] Accomplishing through the main door of completion stage wisdom.

[3455] Scripture and sūtra—two.
[3456] The scripture relying on scripture.
[3457] Wishing the arising of mind and mind.
[3458] Expressing scripture.
[3459] Not wishing words and conventions as basis.
[3460] The sūtra.

[3463] Speaking of the expanse through the great glorious mudrā, correct, surpassing, all-gathering awareness sūtra.
[3464] Speaking non-dually of expanse and primordial wisdom through anu's own text, the sūtra of manifest realization, the gathering of all buddhas' minds.
[3465] Surpassing the characteristics of mind and primordial wisdom.
[3466] The great pure letter sūtra of mind scripture.
[3467] Expanse and primordial wisdom—instantaneous.
[3468] Gradual.
[3469] Progressive.
[3470] Speaking of liberation sphere—five.
[3471] Thus: The great seal free from intellect, expanse and primordial wisdom, bliss-emptiness—the bodhicitta vehicle.
[3472] That also from self-arisen awareness.

[3520] Called the liberation where nothing is obtained.
[3521] Through entering breakthrough, liberation without need for action or effort.
