[8138] First, one enters oneself and the student into the maṇḍala of colored powders revealing the Five Jñānas of Rigpa;
[8139] the Vase Empowerment,
[8140] the Secret Empowerment,
[8141] the Prajñā-Jñāna Empowerment,
[8142] and the Word Empowerment of Dzogchen Complete—bestowing through the Four Signs and making festival.
[8143] <tantra> This is the sequence of the actual Empowerment from Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün.
[8144] Now one performs this as the tradition of direct transmission;
[8145] and it is renowned that the other two lineages from Guru Jo-ber are interrupted.
[8146] Before this, there was only symbolic indication—
[8147] thus it is renowned that there existed no tradition of direct transmission. || 10 ||
[8148] Since it is difficult to bestow hand-blessing upon treasures that have newly emerged, they are not bestowed—this is evident.
[8149] Elaboration of meaning is sufficient;
[8150] and even if one bestows this into actual practice, the root of Empowerment exists—there is no difficulty.
[8151] The Guru said: There is no contradiction even if bestowed.
[8152] Thus these have completed the teaching of the action sequence of the Four Empowerments.
[8153] The third meaning: teaching the classification of Mudrā—difficult to realize, the inner meaning of the Prajñā-Jñāna Empowerment—seventeenfold.
[8154] <list> Examining and searching for the knowledge-woman;
[8155] how to attract her;
[8156] examining the channel characteristics;
[8157] expanding Bodhicitta; || 20 ||
[8158] training in the Dhāraṇī, certainly holding the path of Mantra;
[8159] the esoteric instruction of the method for generating bliss toward her;
[8160] seeking and holding the channel through the special seat of preparation;
[8161] descending the conventional Bindu, relying on the body key;
[8162] the body posture;
[8163] holding through the wind key;
[8164] refining the Bindu, applying the Mudrā of Great Bliss;
[8165] applying certainty to the sequence of bliss arising;
[8166] applying the View to that, calculating change;
[8167] placing the Bindu at the channel object, expanding body strength by mixing with wind, applying to the ultimate Bodhicitta; || 30 ||
[8168] reversing three times for the student's benefit, then sending back, applying to the special certainty of Empowerment;
[8169] holding the measure of the arising of object-free Great Bliss experience for the student;
[8170] relying on the continuum, making unseen;
[8171] other than the time of Empowerment, not relying; offering a gift, sending to her own place, comfortable.
[8172] First:
[8173] <list> Family,
[8174] Shape,
[8175] Color,
[8176] From four examinations through the door of conduct.
[8177] From three examinations through the door of family: || 40 ||
[8178] Outer family: by royal family accomplishing the Buddha of the Tathāgata family;
[8179] by minister family: Vajra;
[8180] by commoner family: Jewel;
[8181] by Brahmin: Lotus;
[8182] by outcaste family: accomplishing the Buddha of the Karma family.
[8183] If one thinks that any single Buddha is accomplished by one alone, it is not so;
[8184] without the knowledge-woman of each respective family, accomplishment does not occur.
[8185] Just as Buddhas arise in Five Families, certainly they are determined as five families.
[8186] <tantra> Thus:
[8187] From the Great Empowerment Arrangement: || 50 ||
[8188] By difference of Buddha family,
[8189] The knowledge-woman also becomes different.
[8190] Thus it is spoken.
[8191] Inner family: daughter of yakṣa,
[8192] daughter of god,
[8193] son of nāga,
[8194] daughter of Brahmā,
[8195] five daughters of Indra—these are the Karma Mudrā family.
[8196] <tantra> From the Vajraḍākinī Samvara:
[8197] God, demigod, or yakṣa, || 60 ||
[8198] Nāga, Indra, and Brahmā—
[8199] Blessed by Mudrā surpassing family.
[8200] Attract and skillfully apply by oneself.
[8201] Thus it is spoken.
[8202] As the master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi by bestowing Empowerment upon the daughters of Brahmā, Indra, and so forth.
[8203] Secret family: four.
[8204] Women do not transcend the channels of the Four Family-Possessed.
[8205] These are: the Conch-Possessed,
[8206] the Elephant-Nose-Possessed,
[8207] the Lotus-Possessed, || 70 ||
[8208] the Deer-Possessed,
[8209] the Cow-Possessed.
[8210] The Conch-Possessed:
[8211] black hair, beautiful teeth, fine arrangement.
[8212] Elephant-Nose: bad hair, excess teeth in front.
[8213] Lotus-Possessed:
[8214] yellow voice, right spiral.
[8215] Deer-Possessed:
[8216] bad hair, great prominence on the forehead.
[8217] Cow-Possessed: || 80 ||
[8218] beautiful hair, wrinkles standing upward at the forehead.
[8219] The Lotus-Possessed generates surpassing bliss and is the helper of Dharmatā clarity.
[8220] As there exists a channel like a lotus open and unopened,
[8221] the instruction for opening the channel mouth is most important.
[8222] Deer-Possessed:
[8223] like the thigh of the deer king Eṇaya, the channel enters thinly.
[8224] For this one, like Eṇaya's thin thigh, expanding;
[8225] the instruction for drawing the channel is most important.
[8226] Elephant-Nose:
[8227] like an elephant's trunk, upwardly reversed. || 90 ||
[8228] For this one, the instruction for attracting is most important.
[8229] Cow-Possessed:
[8230] channel concealed from awareness, mind without stain.
[8231] For this one, the instruction for refining the channel is most important.
[8232] Conch-Possessed:
[8233] like a conch spiraling to the right.
[8234] For this one, the instruction for extracting the channel is most important.
[8235] These five also are determined as five, for upholding the Five Wisdom Families.
[8236] For making bliss the path, none surpass the Lotus-Possessed.
[8237] That, concealed by the Five Family-Possessed, actual Bodhicitta does not arise in women. || 100 ||
[8238] In men, Bindu arises; without the Five Family channels, one is actually able to extract.
[8239] Actual red Bodhicitta not arising is due to not possessing the Five Family-Possessed.
[8240] The channel mouth not changing from its special place is the cause.
[8241] The channel runs upward; nose-blood flows from the right nostril.
[8242] The man: age, youth arrived.
[8243] Body: without disease arising.
[8244] The Deer-Possessed accomplishes the increase of body.
[8245] The Conch-Possessed accomplishes the increase of speech.
[8246] The Elephant-Nose accomplishes the increase of mind.
[8247] The Cow-Possessed accomplishes the increase of mind. || 110 ||
[8248] The Lotus-Possessed accomplishes bliss expanding in the body.
[8249] <tantra> From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8250] All women are Five Family-Possessed;
[8251] That arrangement is Great Bliss,
[8252] Yoginī siddhi is complete.
[8253] Thus it is spoken.
[8254] Completely perfect family:
[8255] ordinary family of common siddhi arising,
[8256] and two Ḍākinīs of supreme siddhi arising family.
[8257] Ordinary: || 120 ||
[8258] wide eyes,
[8259] hair spiraling to the right,
[8260] lower lip with fullness.
[8261] Looking from the left: she smiles;
[8262] looking from the right: nine-fold manifestation;
[8263] looking from the front: very direct.
[8264] Ḍākinī:
[8265] hair flowing upward,
[8266] wide cheeks, thin limbs,
[8267] elongated eyes. || 130 ||
[8268] That: the complete Empowerment.
[8269] <tantra> From the Complete Empowerment:
[8270] Examine the two of special supreme family;
[8271] Obtain bliss by the connection of method and wisdom.
[8272] This becomes the giving of supreme certain scripture.
[8273] Thus it is spoken.
[8274] That also: completing special wisdom from the common nature of the knowledge-woman.
[8275] Certain terminology:
[8276] Knowing directly the wisdom of Rigpa—thus Rigpa.
[8277] "Mā" is so called: in the world, without relying on mā, none exists. || 140 ||
[8278] Like the earth-ground, without relying on the knowledge-woman, Buddha does not arise.
[8279] Some explain this as "Dhāraṇī."
[8280] The Dhāraṇī of the mind's bliss arises relying on the body—thus Dhāraṇī.
[8281] By mastering this, one increases the Dhāraṇī of the body.
[8282] Mā is like the sky;
[8283] just as: without world-realms relying on the sky.
[8284] Mudrā: holding.
[8285] Holding from saṃsāra to the level of Buddha.
[8286] Gya: sealing—sealing saṃsāra with Bodhi.
[8287] Mā is like the food of life. || 150 ||
[8288] Like dying without food.
[8289] Realization not arising without relying on Mudrā;
[8290] binding in the three realms if that does not arise.
[8291] That division:
[8292] Outer five families,
[8293] inner five,
[8294] secret five,
[8295] two completely perfect—seventeen.
[8296] <tantra> From that:
[8297] Family examination seventeen, || 160 ||
[8298] Wisdom sequence similar to that.
[8299] Thus it is spoken.
[8300] Second, examining shape:
[8301] thin waist, flexible body;
[8302] thin limbs, possessing shining fingernails;
[8303] body abiding straight;
[8304] small body mass—the sign of bliss expanding the body.
[8305] <tantra> From that:
[8306] Not long, but short;
[8307] Not frowning, but smiling. || 170 ||
[8308] Thus it is spoken.
[8309] Third, examining color:
[8310] not very white,
[8311] not black,
[8312] not bright gold,
[8313] nor crimson red.
[8314] Departed from these extremes, gathered blue-green—the main family certainty accomplishes;
[8315] wide eyes, eyebrows unbroken;
[8316] white teeth, fine array;
[8317] bliss-giver, Lotus-Born—thus explained. || 180 ||
[8318] <tantra> From before:
[8319] Neither white nor black.
[8320] Thus it is.
[8321] Fourth: examining through the door of conduct,
[8322] whatever is done, slow and gentle;
[8323] walking, similar to the goose-gait;
[8324] pleasant speech, possessed of lion-manner;
[8325] speaking calm and slow;
[8326] walking, going to the right—
[8327] thus. || 190 ||
[8328] Long disposition, gentle conduct,
[8329] good mind, vast scope,
[8330] great shame.
[8331] <tantra> From before:
[8332] Body, mind, conduct wide;
[8333] however done, slow itself.
[8334] By this, Great Bliss increases.
[8335] Thus it is.
[8336] These certainties extensively—
[8337] <tantra> from the Perfect Self-Arisen: || 200 ||
[8338] Thus to secret-capable youths,
[8339] Secret Empowerment wishing to bestow,
[8340] Dhāraṇī, mind-suitable, seek.
[8341] That too: characteristics examine—this is important.
[8342] That characteristic examine:
[8343] Families four explained;
