[8138] <prose> First, one enters oneself and the student into the maṇḍala of colored powders revealing the Five Jñānas of Rigpa;
[8139] <prose> the Vase Empowerment,
[8140] <prose> the Secret Empowerment,
[8141] <prose> the Prajñā-Jñāna Empowerment,
[8142] <prose> and the Word Empowerment of Dzogchen Complete—bestowing through the Four Signs and making festival.
[8143] <prose> <tantra> This is the sequence of the actual Empowerment from Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün.
[8144] <prose> Now one performs this as the tradition of direct transmission;
[8145] <prose> and it is renowned that the other two lineages from Guru Jo-ber are interrupted.
[8146] <prose> Before this, there was only symbolic indication—
[8147] <prose> thus it is renowned that there existed no tradition of direct transmission. || 10 ||
[8148] <prose> Furthermore, since it is difficult to bestow hand-blessing upon treasures that have newly emerged, they are not bestowed—this is evident.
[8149] <prose> Elaboration of meaning is sufficient;
[8150] <prose> and even if one bestows this into actual practice, the root of Empowerment exists—there is no difficulty.
[8151] <prose> The Guru said: There is no contradiction even if bestowed.
[8152] <prose> Thus these have completed the teaching of the action sequence of the Four Empowerments.
[8153] <prose> Therefore, the third meaning: teaching the classification of Mudrā—difficult to realize, the inner meaning of the Prajñā-Jñāna Empowerment—seventeenfold.
[8154] <list> Examining and searching for the knowledge-woman;
[8155] <prose> how to attract her;
[8156] <prose> examining the channel characteristics;
[8157] <prose> expanding Bodhicitta; || 20 ||
[8158] <prose> training in the Dhāraṇī, certainly holding the path of Mantra;
[8159] <prose> the esoteric instruction of the method for generating bliss toward her;
[8160] <prose> seeking and holding the channel through the special seat of preparation;
[8161] <prose> descending the conventional Bindu, relying on the body key;
[8162] <prose> the body posture;
[8163] <prose> holding through the wind key;
[8164] <prose> refining the Bindu, applying the Mudrā of Great Bliss;
[8165] <prose> applying certainty to the sequence of bliss arising;
[8166] <prose> applying the View to that, calculating change;
[8167] <prose> placing the Bindu at the channel object, expanding body strength by mixing with wind, applying to the ultimate Bodhicitta; || 30 ||
[8168] <prose> Moreover, reversing three times for the student's benefit, then sending back, applying to the special certainty of Empowerment;
[8169] <prose> holding the measure of the arising of object-free Great Bliss experience for the student;
[8170] <prose> relying on the continuum, making unseen;
[8171] <prose> other than the time of Empowerment, not relying; offering a gift, sending to her own place, comfortable.
[8172] <ornament> First:
[8173] <list> Family,
[8174] <prose> Shape,
[8175] <prose> Color,
[8176] <prose><tantra> From four examinations through the door of conduct.
[8177] <prose><tantra> From three examinations through the door of family: || 40 ||
[8178] <prose> Outer family: by royal family accomplishing the Buddha of the Tathāgata family;
[8179] <prose> by minister family: Vajra;
[8180] <prose> by commoner family: Jewel;
[8181] <prose> by Brahmin: Lotus;
[8182] <prose> by outcaste family: accomplishing the Buddha of the Karma family.
[8183] <prose> Furthermore, if one thinks that any single Buddha is accomplished by one alone, it is not so;
[8184] <prose> without the knowledge-woman of each respective family, accomplishment does not occur.
[8185] <prose> Just as Buddhas arise in Five Families, certainly they are determined as five families.
[8186] <prose> <tantra> Thus:
[8187] <prose><tantra> From the Great Empowerment Arrangement: || 50 ||
[8188] <prose> By difference of Buddha family,
[8189] <prose> The knowledge-woman also becomes different.
[8190] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[8191] <prose> Inner family: daughter of yakṣa,
[8192] <prose> daughter of god,
[8193] <prose> son of nāga,
[8194] <prose> daughter of Brahmā,
[8195] <prose> five daughters of Indra—these are the Karma Mudrā family.
[8196] <prose> <tantra> From the Vajraḍākinī Samvara:
[8197] <prose> God, demigod, or yakṣa, || 60 ||
[8198] <prose> Nāga, Indra, and Brahmā—
[8199] <prose> Blessed by Mudrā surpassing family.
[8200] <prose> Attract and skillfully apply by oneself.
[8201] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[8202] <prose> As the master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi by bestowing Empowerment upon the daughters of Brahmā, Indra, and so forth.
[8203] <prose> Secret family: four.
[8204] <prose> Women do not transcend the channels of the Four Family-Possessed.
[8205] <prose> These are: the Conch-Possessed,
[8206] <prose> the Elephant-Nose-Possessed,
[8207] <prose> the Lotus-Possessed, || 70 ||
[8208] <prose> the Deer-Possessed,
[8209] <prose> the Cow-Possessed.
[8210] <prose> The Conch-Possessed:
[8211] <prose> black hair, beautiful teeth, fine arrangement.
[8212] <prose> Elephant-Nose: bad hair, excess teeth in front.
[8213] <prose> Lotus-Possessed:
[8214] <prose> yellow voice, right spiral.
[8215] <prose> Deer-Possessed:
[8216] <prose> bad hair, great prominence on the forehead.
[8217] <prose> Cow-Possessed: || 80 ||
[8218] <prose> beautiful hair, wrinkles standing upward at the forehead.
[8219] <prose> The Lotus-Possessed generates surpassing bliss and is the helper of Dharmatā clarity.
[8220] <prose> As there exists a channel like a lotus open and unopened,
[8221] <prose> the instruction for opening the channel mouth is most important.
[8222] <prose> Deer-Possessed:
[8223] <prose> like the thigh of the deer king Eṇaya, the channel enters thinly.
[8224] <prose> For this one, like Eṇaya's thin thigh, expanding;
[8225] <prose> the instruction for drawing the channel is most important.
[8226] <prose> Elephant-Nose:
[8227] <prose> like an elephant's trunk, upwardly reversed. || 90 ||
[8228] <prose> For this one, the instruction for attracting is most important.
[8229] <prose> Cow-Possessed:
[8230] <prose> channel concealed from awareness, mind without stain.
[8231] <prose> For this one, the instruction for refining the channel is most important.
[8232] <prose> Conch-Possessed:
[8233] <prose> like a conch spiraling to the right.
[8234] <prose> For this one, the instruction for extracting the channel is most important.
[8235] <prose> These five also are determined as five, for upholding the Five Wisdom Families.
[8236] <prose> For making bliss the path, none surpass the Lotus-Possessed.
[8237] <prose> That, concealed by the Five Family-Possessed, actual Bodhicitta does not arise in women. || 100 ||
[8238] <prose> In men, Bindu arises; without the Five Family channels, one is actually able to extract.
[8239] <prose> Actual red Bodhicitta not arising is due to not possessing the Five Family-Possessed.
[8240] <prose> The channel mouth not changing from its special place is the cause.
[8241] <prose> The channel runs upward; nose-blood flows from the right nostril.
[8242] <prose> The man: age, youth arrived.
[8243] <prose> Body: without disease arising.
[8244] <prose> The Deer-Possessed accomplishes the increase of body.
[8245] <prose> The Conch-Possessed accomplishes the increase of speech.
[8246] <prose> The Elephant-Nose accomplishes the increase of mind.
[8247] <prose> The Cow-Possessed accomplishes the increase of mind. || 110 ||
[8248] <prose> The Lotus-Possessed accomplishes bliss expanding in the body.
[8249] <prose> <tantra> From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8250] <prose> All women are Five Family-Possessed;
[8251] <prose> That arrangement is Great Bliss,
[8252] <prose> Yoginī siddhi is complete.
[8253] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[8254] <prose> Completely perfect family:
[8255] <prose> ordinary family of common siddhi arising,
[8256] <prose> and two Ḍākinīs of supreme siddhi arising family.
[8257] <prose> Ordinary: || 120 ||
[8258] <prose> wide eyes,
[8259] <prose> hair spiraling to the right,
[8260] <prose> lower lip with fullness.
[8261] <prose> Looking from the left: she smiles;
[8262] <prose> looking from the right: nine-fold manifestation;
[8263] <prose> looking from the front: very direct.
[8264] <prose> Ḍākinī:
[8265] <prose> hair flowing upward,
[8266] <prose> wide cheeks, thin limbs,
[8267] <prose> elongated eyes. || 130 ||
[8268] <prose> That: the complete Empowerment.
[8269] <prose> <tantra> From the Complete Empowerment:
[8270] <prose> Examine the two of special supreme family;
[8271] <prose> Obtain bliss by the connection of method and wisdom.
[8272] <prose> This becomes the giving of supreme certain scripture.
[8273] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[8274] <prose> That also: completing special wisdom from the common nature of the knowledge-woman.
[8275] <prose> Certain terminology:
[8276] <prose> Knowing directly the wisdom of Rigpa—thus Rigpa.
[8277] <verse> "Mā" is so called: in the world, without relying on mā, none exists. || 140 ||
[8278] <prose> Like the earth-ground, without relying on the knowledge-woman, Buddha does not arise.
[8279] <prose> Some explain this as "Dhāraṇī."
[8280] <prose> The Dhāraṇī of the mind's bliss arises relying on the body—thus Dhāraṇī.
[8281] <prose> By mastering this, one increases the Dhāraṇī of the body.
[8282] <prose> Mā is like the sky;
[8283] <prose> just as: without world-realms relying on the sky.
[8284] <prose> Mudrā: holding.
[8285] <prose> Holding from saṃsāra to the level of Buddha.
[8286] <prose> Gya: sealing—sealing saṃsāra with Bodhi.
[8287] <prose> Mā is like the food of life. || 150 ||
[8288] <prose> Like dying without food.
[8289] <prose> Realization not arising without relying on Mudrā;
[8290] <prose> binding in the three realms if that does not arise.
[8291] <prose> That division:
[8292] <prose> Outer five families,
[8293] <prose> inner five,
[8294] <prose> secret five,
[8295] <prose> two completely perfect—seventeen.
[8296] <prose> <tantra> From that:

[8302] <prose> thin limbs, possessing shining fingernails;
[8303] <prose> body abiding straight;
[8304] <prose> small body mass—the sign of bliss expanding the body.
[8305] <prose> <tantra> From that:
[8306] <prose> Not long, but short;
[8307] <prose> Not frowning, but smiling. || 170 ||
[8308] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[8309] <prose> Third, examining color:
[8310] <prose> not very white,
[8311] <prose> not black,
[8312] <prose> not bright gold,
[8313] <prose> nor crimson red.
[8314] <prose> Departed from these extremes, gathered blue-green—the main family certainty accomplishes;
[8315] <prose> wide eyes, eyebrows unbroken;
[8316] <prose> white teeth, fine array;
[8317] <prose> bliss-giver, Lotus-Born—thus explained. || 180 ||
[8318] <prose> <tantra> From before:
[8319] <prose> Neither white nor black.
[8320] <prose> Thus it is.
[8321] <ornament> Fourth: examining through the door of conduct,
[8322] <prose> whatever is done, slow and gentle;
[8323] <prose> walking, similar to the goose-gait;
[8324] <prose> pleasant speech, possessed of lion-manner;
[8325] <prose> speaking calm and slow;
[8326] <prose> walking, going to the right—
[8327] <prose> thus. || 190 ||
[8328] <prose> Long disposition, gentle conduct,
[8329] <prose> good mind, vast scope,
[8330] <prose> great shame.
[8331] <prose> <tantra> From before:
[8332] <prose> Body, mind, conduct wide;
[8333] <prose> however done, slow itself.
[8334] <prose> By this, Great Bliss increases.
[8335] <prose> Thus it is.
[8336] <prose> These certainties extensively—
[8337] <prose> <tantra> from the Perfect Self-Arisen: || 200 ||
[8338] <prose> Thus to secret-capable youths,
[8339] <prose> Secret Empowerment wishing to bestow,
[8340] <prose> Dhāraṇī, mind-suitable, seek.
[8341] <prose> That too: characteristics examine—this is important.
