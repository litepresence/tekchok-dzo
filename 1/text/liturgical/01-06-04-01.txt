[8138] First: entering self and student into colored-powder maṇḍala indicating five rigpa wisdoms,
[8139] Vase,
[8140] Secret,
[8141] Prajñā-jñāna,
[8142] Empowering Dzogchen complete word empowerment with four signs, making festival.
[8143] This is the sequence of actual empowerment from Vimala to Legé-tsün.



[8144] Now doing as hand tradition,
[8145] And renowned that the other two from Guru Jo-ber are cut.
[8146] Before that, from symbols only,
[8147] Renowned that there is no hand tradition.
[8148] Obvious that it is difficult to bestow hand-receiving coming from treasure, so not bestowed.
[8149] Meaning elaboration is sufficient,
[8150] And bestowing into practice: empowerment root exists, difficulty not.
[8151] Guru said: no contradiction even if bestowed.
[8152] Those have finished teaching the action sequence of four empowerments.
[8153] Teaching the third meaning: classification of mudra difficult to realize—inner meaning of prajñā-jñāna empowerment—seventeen.
[8154] Examining and searching knowledge-woman,
[8155] How to attract that,
[8156] Examining channel characteristics,
[8157] Expanding bodhicitta,
[8158] Training in dharani, certainly holding mantra path,
[8159] Pith-instruction of method generating bliss to that,
[8160] Searching and holding channel with special preparation seat,
[8161] Down-casting conventional bindu relying on body key,
[8162] Body posture,
[8163] Holding with wind key,
[8164] Refining bindu, applying great bliss mudra,
[8165] Applying certainty to sequence of bliss arising,
[8166] Applying view to that, calculating change,
[8167] Placing bindu at channel object, expanding body strength by mixing with wind, applying to ultimate bodhicitta.
[8168] Reversing three times for student's benefit, then sending back, applying to special certainty of empowerment.
[8169] Holding measure of experience of object-free great bliss arising for student.
[8170] Relying on continuum, making unseen,
[8171] Other than empowerment time, not relying, offering gift, sending to self's place, comfortable.
[8172] First:
[8173] Family,
[8174] Shape,
[8175] Color,
[8176] From four examinations through conduct door.



[8177] From three examinations through the door of family:
[8178] Outer family: by royal family accomplishing Buddha of Sugata family,
[8179] By minister family: vajra,
[8180] By commoner family: jewel,
[8181] By brahmin: lotus,
[8182] By outcaste family: accomplishing Buddha of karma family.
[8183] If thinking that whichever Buddha is accomplished by one, it is not so;
[8184] Without each knowledge-woman for each family, it is not accomplished.
[8185] Just as Buddhas arise in five families, certainly in five families.
[8186] Thus:
[8187] From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8188] "By difference of Buddha family,
[8189] Knowledge-woman thus becomes different."
[8190] Thus it is spoken.
[8191] Inner family: daughter of yakṣa,
[8192] Daughter of god,
[8193] Son of nāga,
[8194] Daughter of Brahmā,
[8195] Five daughters of Indra are the karma mudra family.
[8196] From the Vajra Ḍākinī Samvara:
[8197] "God, demigod, or yakṣa,
[8198] Nāga, Indra, and Brahmā—
[8199] Blessed by mudra surpassing family.
[8200] Attract and well apply by self."
[8201] Thus it is spoken.
[8202] As the master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi by empowering, having attracted daughters of Brahmā, Indra, and so forth.
[8203] Secret family: four.
[8204] Women do not transcend the channels of four family-possessed.
[8205] That: conch-possessed,
[8206] Elephant-nose-possessed,
[8207] Lotus-possessed,
[8208] Deer-possessed,
[8209] Cow-possessed.
[8210] Conch-possessed:
[8211] Black hair, good teeth, good arrangement.
[8212] Elephant-nose: bad hair, excess front teeth.
[8213] Lotus-possessed:
[8214] Yellow voice, right li.
[8215] Deer-possessed:
[8216] Bad hair, big forehead prominence.
[8217] Cow-possessed:
[8218] Good hair, wrinkle standing upward at forehead.
[8219] That lotus-possessed generates excess bliss, helper of dharmatā clarity.
[8220] As there is a channel like lotus open and not-open,
[8221] Instruction of opening channel mouth is most important.
[8222] Deer-possessed:



[8223] Like the thigh of deer king Eṇaya, channel enters thinly.
[8224] To this, like Eṇaya's thin thigh, expanding.
[8225] Instruction of drawing channel is most important.
[8226] Elephant-nose:
[8227] Like elephant nose, upward reversed.
[8228] To this, instruction of attracting is most important.
[8229] Cow-possessed:
[8230] Channel concealed from sleep, mind without stain.
[8231] To this, instruction of refining channel is most important.
[8232] Conch-possessed:
[8233] Like conch spiraling right.
[8234] To this, instruction of extracting channel is most important.
[8235] Those five also are certain as five, for holding the five wisdom families.
[8236] For making bliss the path, none surpass lotus-possessed.
[8237] That, covered by five family-possessed, actual bodhicitta does not arise in women.
[8238] In men bindu arises; without five family channels, actually able to extract.
[8239] Actual red bodhicitta not arising is due to not having five family-possessed.
[8240] Channel mouth not changing from special place is the cause.
[8241] Channel runs upward, nose-blood flows from right nose-hole.
[8242] Man: age, youth arrived.
[8243] Body: without arising disease.
[8244] That deer-possessed accomplishes body increase.
[8245] Conch-possessed accomplishes speech increase.
[8246] Elephant-nose accomplishes mind increase.
[8247] Cow-possessed accomplishes mind increase.
[8248] Lotus-possessed accomplishes bliss expanding in body.
[8249] From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8250] "All women five family-possessed,
[8251] That arrangement great bliss,
[8252] Yoginī siddhi complete."
[8253] Thus it is spoken.
[8254] Completely perfect family:

[8256] Two ḍākinīs of supreme siddhi arising family.
[8257] Ordinary:
[8258] Wide eyes,
[8259] Hair spiraling right,
[8260] Lower lip excess.
[8261] Looking from left: smiles,
[8262] Looking from right: nine manifest,
[8263] Looking from front: very straight.
[8264] Ḍākinī:  [8265] Hair flowing upward,  [8266] Wide cheeks, thin limbs,  [8267] Long eyes.  [8268] That: complete empowerment.  [8269] Examine two of special supreme family.

[8273] That also: completing special wisdom from common nature of knowledge-woman.  [8274] Certain term:  [8275] Knowing directly the wisdom of rigpa, thus rigpa.  [8276] "Ma" called: in the world, without relying on ma, none.  [8277] Like earth ground, without relying on knowledge-woman, Buddha does not arise.  [8278] Some explain as "dharani."  [8279] Dharani of mind's bliss arises relying on body, thus dharani.  [8280] This, by mastering, increases body dharani.  [8281] Ma is like sky.  [8282] Like: without world realm relying on sky.  [8283] Some name "mudra."  [8284] Mudra: holding.  [8285] Holding from saṃsāra to Buddha level.  [8286] Gya: sealing, sealing saṃsāra with bodhi.  [8287] Ma is like life food.  [8288] Like dying without food.  [8289] Realization not arising without relying on mudra.  [8290] Binding in three realms if that does not arise.  [8291] That division:  [8292] Outer five families,  [8293] Inner five,  [8294] Secret five,  [8295] Two completely perfect—seventeen.  [8296] From that:  [8297] "Family examination seventeen,  [8298] Wisdom sequence similar to that."  [8299] Thus it is spoken.  [8300] Second, examining shape:  [8301] Thin waist, flexible body.  [8302] Thin limbs, possessing shining fingernails.  [8303] Body abiding straight.  [8304] Small body mass—sign of bliss expanding body.  [8305] From that:  [8306] "Not long, short,  [8307] Not frowning, smiling."  [8308] Thus it is spoken.  [8309] Third, examining color:  [8310] Not very white,  [8311] Not black.

[8277] Like earth ground, without relying on knowledge-woman, Buddha does not arise.
[8278] Some explain as "dharani."
[8279] Dharani of mind's bliss arises relying on body, thus dharani.
[8280] This, by mastering, increases body dharani.
[8281] Ma is like sky.
[8282] Like: without world realm relying on sky.
[8283] Some name "mudra."
[8284] Mudra: holding.
[8285] Holding from saṃsāra to Buddha level.
[8286] Gya: sealing, sealing saṃsāra with bodhi.
[8287] Ma is like life food.
[8288] Like dying without food.
[8289] Realization not arising without relying on mudra.
