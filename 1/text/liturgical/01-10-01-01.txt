[12560] <prose>Again the parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation.</prose>
[12561] <prose>The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is your aunt, the coemergent ignorance.</prose>
[12562] <prose>Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition.</prose>
[12563] <prose>The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding.</prose>

[12570] <prose>The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps.</prose>
[12571] <prose>Send them as troops, one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method.</prose>
