[12500] The Vajra Essence Path reveals the primordial nature wherein existence itself arises as spontaneous presence beyond conceptual elaboration.
[12501] The forms of sentient beings emerge as inconceivable manifestations beyond the reach of ordinary conceptual mind.
[12502] The path of delusion and intention arises according to the manner in which conceptual thought manifests its own nature.
[12503] Vajrasattva represents the pure awareness of Rigpa, the self-arising wisdom of Dharmatā.
[12504] The vast expanse represents the ground of being wherein all phenomena naturally abide.
[12505] The primordial fourfold nature abides as the basis of all manifestation.
[12506] The magnificent abode manifests as the gateway of spontaneous presence.
[12507] The ground appearance arises effortlessly as the natural display of clear light.
[12508] The timeless moment when sound emerged represents the beginningless Dharmatā of Samantabhadra.
[12509] When self appears as other through non-recognition, the ground of delusion manifests as apparent existence. || 10 ||
[12510] The year of the Pig marks the time when non-recognition was fully established as conceptual imputation.
[12511] The emanated sun represents the clear perception of coarse object appearances arising as Nirmāṇakāya.
[12512] The Bird constellation represents desire that arose as attachment to objects of the five senses.
[12513] The old woman represents the emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded apprehension of self.
[12514] The uncertain lineage represents how ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion without distinction.
[12515] The four rugged ones represent the four conditions that give rise to all experience.
[12516] The five wild ones represent the five poisons that obscure the natural state.
[12517] The single back support represents the conceptualizing mind that grasps at duality.
[12518] The single thief represents anger that steals the peace of natural awareness.
[12519] The single gatherer represents how deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. || 20 ||
[12520] This mind becomes the apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence.
[12521] From this arise the manifold afflictions as the hosts of maras that obscure realization.
[12522] Thus delusion arose from the primordial purity without ground or basis, hence called existence.
[12523] The second section reveals delusion and liberation through the profound metaphors of the Vajra Essence.
[12524] From spontaneous presence comes the teaching that all pure appearances should be understood through these symbols.
[12525] In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion, manifestation of self-arising wisdom.
[12526] He had two sons who were imprisoned in a cave, thus the story of delusion begins.
[12527] Then five soldiers came and conquered from the stone fortress peak, representing the five poisons.
[12528] The two sons were sent into the valley and the old woman with the mushroom hat blocked the gate of liberation.
[12529] Then four men captured them and separated the five men from their horses, representing the four wisdoms. || 30 ||
[12530] The two sons escaped by themselves and killed the prison guards, representing self-liberation.
[12531] The two sons fled to a place of sun and rain, gathered subjects, and consulted with twenty-one queens of wisdom.
[12532] They fled to the temple of Fierce Thought where five men wearing five hats guarded the gate.
[12533] No one could enter without recognition, thus the story continues.
[12534] Then four mirrors looked at the demon and recognized their own nature as Dharmakāya.
[12535] Then seeing a house with eight doors, they laughed and lost themselves in spontaneous presence.
[12536] These metaphorical forms point to the meaning of primordial wisdom manifesting as Saṃbhogakāya.
[12537] The Teacher Light Diffusion represents self-arising wisdom, the Buddha nature within all beings.
[12538] The two sons represent the wisdom of primordial purity and spontaneous presence united.
[12539] Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom and is bound by non-recognition. || 40 ||
[12540] The five men conquering from the stone fortress represents how the five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding nature.
[12541] The two sons blocked by the old woman represents Rigpa entering the valley of existence, blocked by non-recognition.
[12542] Being captured by four men and separating five from horses represents how the four wisdoms purify the five afflictions.
[12543] The four wisdoms liberate afflictions, gather wisdom, distinguish between afflictions and wisdom, and move to the expanse.
[12544] The two sons escaping and killing guards represents recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual bonds.
[12545] The two sons fleeing to sun and rain and gathering subjects represents Rigpa entering the eyes and beholding the expanse.
[12546] The queens consulting and fleeing to the temple represents the twenty-one instructions manifesting inner meaning.
[12547] The five men guarding with hats represents the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought.
[12548] The four mirrors looking at the demon represents the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa.
[12549] Seeing the house with eight doors represents recognizing spontaneous presence and establishing the ground. || 50 ||
[12550] The third section presents another teaching from the same source of spontaneous presence.
[12551] In the Land of Great Circumference dwelt a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and mind.
[12552] The Land of Radiant Light was seen by the Teacher Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness.
[12553] Listen, Radiant Being, and I shall prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.
[12554] Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the Ocean with Rim, where Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell.
[12555] From their union came two children, brother and sister, representing wisdom and means.
[12556] Then the parents spoke thus to the children, giving instructions for the path.
[12557] Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition.
[12558] Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit.
[12559] The son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in non-recognition. || 60 ||
[12560] Again the parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation.
[12561] The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is your aunt, the coemergent ignorance.
[12562] Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition.
[12563] The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding.
[12564] Noble parents, that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings.
[12565] Send five servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light.
[12566] Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families, thus he requested.
[12567] The parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports.
[12568] Then the son spoke again, asking for further guidance.
[12569] Noble parents, if I am captured in the demon land, what method shall I use? || 70 ||
[12570] The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps.
[12571] Send them as troops, one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method.
[12572] Two to block the gate of delusion, thus they gave the complete instructions.
[12573] Thus prophesied by the parents, the son said he would do so with confidence.
[12574] Saying E Ma Ho, he departed, and the demon Black Halika saw him approaching.
[12575] Oh, a flesh-eating human has appeared, do not let him escape, said the attendants of affliction.
[12576] The five demons captured him, and Aunt Mushroom Hat put him in iron chains of grasping.
[12577] She told the attendants that he killed her son, so do not release him from bondage.
[12578] The attendants agreed, and thus he had no power to escape without wisdom.
[12579] Then the boy spoke thus, using skillful means. || 80 ||
[12580] Noble aunt, my parents said that Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells in the demon land of non-recognition.
[12581] They told me to come to the mirror, so release me without capture for I am your relative.
[12582] The old woman replied that she would not release him because he killed her son of delusion.
[12583] Then the boy spoke again, threatening to use force.
[12584] If you do not release me, I shall summon troops of wisdom to conquer.
[12585] You yourself summon troops, she replied arrogantly, and thus he could not escape alone.
[12586] Then the boy sent messages to three friends representing the three baskets of teachings.
[12587] Friends, in the Jewel Heap Land of mind dwell four people of the caste, the four lamps.
[12588] Go there, for the boy Rig Knowledge has been captured, bring many troops of wisdom.
[12589] They agreed and went swiftly to assist their friend. || 90 ||
[12590] Then within three days at sunrise, many troops came and blocked the gate of delusion.
[12591] The prisoner's irons were broken, the old woman of non-recognition was expelled.
[12592] The five were separated from their horses, and Aunt's son was captured.
[12593] The attendants were beheaded with swords of wisdom and killed, liberating all.
[12594] Then he fled to his own land and met his sister coming with many flowers of virtue.
[12595] The parents recognized them and rejoiced greatly, naming the brother Vajra Chain Puller.
[12596] The sister was named Rim Holder, representing the bindu of clear light.
[12597] Then the siblings consulted and saw the Teacher Mirror Possessor, Buddha Samantabhadra.
[12598] Listen, noble child, in the Uncontrived Appearance Land dwells a crystal stupa of Dharmakāya.
[12599] Upon its wheel are four silver mirrors of the four lamps, so go from Malaya's peak. || 100 ||
[12600] Put it in the rim enclosure, climb the jewel stairs carrying a jewel vessel of wisdom.
[12601] At the stupa's peak dwells a teacher Unchanging Light, the Dharmakāya Buddha.
[12602] From his right foot comes a light-ray rope of compassion, so hold it without fear and go.
[12603] Then your appearance's father is there, so run there with devotion.
[12604] Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors, where your mother Various Appearance dwells.
[12605] At that time you will not recognize your mother due to habitual patterns.
[12606] Beyond that is a house of various jewels, your true abode, so take your seat there.
[12607] Thus prophesied by the Teacher, the boy Chain Puller spoke thus with gratitude.
[12608] Great Teacher, we shall do so, he said to his sister with determination.
[12609] We shall do as the Teacher prophesied, following the path of liberation. || 110 ||
[12610] Riding the sun's rays of wisdom, wearing rainbow armor of the elements.
[12611] With a pearl garland binding the waist of channels, holding a crystal spear of awareness.
[12612] A path appeared in space and they reached the jewel house without obstruction.
[12613] The meaning is thus, profound and vast.
[12614] The Great Circumference Land represents cyclic existence with its endless rounds.

[12628] Lost in delusion, Rigpa wanders there, needing the five wisdoms as companions.
[12629] The son asking the method represents seeking liberation from delusion through inquiry. || 130 ||

[12661] The fourth section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence.
[12662] In the Pure Appearance Land dwells a fortress with eight doors of liberation.
[12663] The boy Self-Arising Rigpa Knowledge rules there as the natural state.
[12664] An old woman Mushroom Hat dwells there, and the king Arrow Guard Fame Power.
[12665] He has five princely sons who went to play, capturing the old woman of ignorance.
[12666] Then the boy went to the daughter's playground, captured and put in chains.

[12669] The eight-door fortress represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of liberation. || 170 ||

[12674] Capturing the old woman represents non-recognition grasped by the five poisons.
[12675] The five poisons become one with non-recognition, unified in deluded essence.
[12676] This is how non-recognition appears in each sense when meeting the five poisons.
[12677] Going to the daughter's playground represents how non-recognition's essence exists in Rigpa.
[12678] Rigpa captured in its place represents conceptual grasping wherever attachment and aversion arise.
[12679] The essence is Rigpa, the reverse is non-recognition, knowing which liberates completely. || 180 ||
[12680] The fifth section on reversing delusion presents another profound teaching.
[12681] In the Jewel Heap Land, an old woman possessed a precious jewel of awareness.
[12682] Five thieves stole it, causing her suffering in cyclic existence.
[12683] Then the thieves were pursued and went to the Thorn Land of difficulties.
[12684] The five thieves stealing caused the old woman to faint into ignorance.
[12685] Pursuing the thieves from the Thorn Land, the old woman revived through wisdom.
[12686] Then the old woman's son White Fire God spoke thus with inquiry.
[12687] Has my jewel been lost, he asked, seeking his true nature.
[12688] The five men replied, the jewel is not lost, but kill your old woman of ignorance.
[12689] If you do not kill the old woman, we will not give the jewel of wisdom. || 190 ||
[12690] So he killed her, ate the flesh, drank the blood, sucked the bones completely.
[12691] Making everything non-existent, the thieves gave the jewel of liberation.
[12692] The meaning is thus, a profound teaching on self-liberation.
[12693] The Jewel Heap Land represents the mind as the source of all.
[12694] The old woman is non-recognition, the jewel is Rigpa, the thieves are the five poisons.

[12696] Pursuing represents severing, going to the Thorn Land of practice.
[12697] The old woman fainting represents temporary ignorance overcome by wisdom.
[12698] Wisdom investigates Rigpa and its coemergent non-recognition with the five poisons.
[12699] Now in cyclic existence, knowing this, non-recognition and five poisons merely abide in the ground. || 200 ||
[12700] Thus when the root of delusion is severed by wisdom, Rigpa recognizes itself.
[12701] Non-recognition self-liberates, like reviving after being severed from grasping.
[12702] Fire God represents wisdom born of self-recognition, burning delusion.
[12703] Asking if the jewel is lost, killing the old woman represents Rigpa investigating itself.

[12757] Gathered, becoming powerful with the strength of awareness.
[12758] Because wisdom is without attachment or aversion.
[12759] All god hosts captured in prison, bound by non-recognition. || 260 ||
[12760] Captured, siddhi becomes near through practice.
[12761] Because Rigpa is universally vast, beyond limit.
[12762] Cutting the essence, generation stage becomes clear as the path.
[12763] Because Rigpa is without effort and accomplishment.
