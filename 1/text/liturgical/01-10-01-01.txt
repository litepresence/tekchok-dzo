[12500] Thus cyclic existence by name arises.
[12501] The inconceivable forms of beings arise.
[12502] Delusion's path and thought, however conceived, arise as such—thus it is spoken.

[12503] <symbol> Therein Vajrasattva is Rigpa, Awareness Itself.
[12504] <symbol> The Broad Expanse, field of display—
[12505] <symbol> the Primordial Four.
[12506] <symbol> Beautiful Abode,
[12507] <symbol> gateway where basis-appearances spontaneously arise.
[12508] <symbol> When time dissolves,
[12509] <symbol> self non-recognition appears as other—the deluded basis-display.
[12510] <symbol> Year of the Pig,
[12511] <symbol> time when ignorance is fully conceptualized.
[12512] <symbol> Emanated Sun,
[12513] <symbol> clear thought-grasping of coarse appearances.
[12514] <symbol> Star of the Bird,
[12515] <symbol> attachment to objects arisen as desire.
[12516] <symbol> The Elder Crone,
[12517] <symbol> non-recognition consciousness arisen as deluded grasping.
[12518] <symbol> Indeterminate lineage,
[12519] <symbol> basis-appearance wherever arising and liberating—common ground of delusion and liberation.
[12520] <symbol> Four companions,
[12521] <symbol> Four conditions.
[12522] <symbol> Five wild men,
[12523] <symbol> Five poisons.
[12524] <symbol> One back-support,
[12525] <symbol> conceptualizing mind.
[12526] <symbol> One thief,
[12527] <symbol> anger.
[12528] <symbol> One accumulating all,
[12529] <symbol> delusion-appearance established as one.

[12530] That mind indeed grasps delusion-appearance.
[12531] From that, many afflictions arise—
[12532] hosts of armies.
[12533] Thus delusion from primordial purity, without samsara-basis, from incompleteness arisen.

[12534] Second,
[12535] the practice lineage indicates delusion and
[12536] liberation—two revealed.

[12537] <tantra> Again from the Self-Arisen:
[12538] <tantra> "HO! Listen, O pure ones of the expanse!
[12539] <tantra> The Buddha intention—measure this all to be grasped."

[12540] Before, in the Broad Expanse,
[12541] Teacher Light-Spread existed.
[12542] He had two sons,
[12543] imprisoned in empty cave—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12544] Five soldiers arose, stone fortress destroyed—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12545] Two sons sent into hole.

[12546] Elder Crone closed the door—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12547] Four men chasing caught them,
[12548] five men separated from horses—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12549] Two sons losing themselves, guard killed—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12550] Two sons fled to Rain-Sun, gathered taxes from subjects,
[12551] twenty-one queens counseled,
[12552] fled to Samrudra temple,
[12553] five men wearing armor guarding door
[12554] none could enter—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12555] Then four mirrors looked,
[12556] self by self-face known—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12557] House with eight doors seen, self laughed at self—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12558] Thus symbols, appearances all
[12559] indicate—wisdom meaning applied
[12560] thus it is spoken.

[12561] <symbol> Teacher Light-Spread is
[12562] <symbol> self-arising wisdom.
[12563] <symbol> Two sons are
[12564] <symbol> awareness pure and spontaneous wisdom two.
[12565] <symbol> Imprisoned in cave is
[12566] <symbol> in spontaneous appearance wisdom mother-son mixed,
[12567] <symbol> by non-recognition bound in samsara.
[12568] <symbol> Five men destroying stone fortress peak is
[12569] <symbol> five poisons moving awareness from self-abode, caused delusion.
[12570] <symbol> Two sons, door closed by Elder Crone is
[12571] <symbol> awareness samsara hole entered,
[12572] <symbol> non-recognition closed door, liberation not given.
[12573] <symbol> Four catching, five separated from horses is
[12574] <symbol> four wisdoms five affliction thoughts with wind purified.

[12575] <symbol> Four wisdoms:
[12576] <symbol> Liberating wisdom liberates afflictions.
[12577] <symbol> Gathering wisdom gathers wisdom.
[12578] <symbol> Distinguishing wisdom separates afflictions and wisdom.
[12579] <symbol> Moving wisdom moves to expanse.

[12580] <symbol> Two sons losing, killing guard is
[12581] <symbol> knowing self by self-awareness, obscurations binding actions self-liberated without trace.
[12582] <symbol> Two sons fleeing to Sun-Rain, gathering tax is
[12583] <symbol> Rigpa, awareness knowing itself.
[12584] <symbol> The fivefold display of wisdom.
[12585] <symbol> Rigpa, awareness knowing itself.
[12586] <symbol> The fivefold display of wisdom.
[12587] <symbol> Thought finds no gap.
[12588] <symbol> The fourfold wisdom liberates all.
[12589] <symbol> Self-face known is
[12590] <symbol> Wisdom self-arisen, spontaneously pure.
[12591] <symbol> House eight doors seen, laughter released is
[12592] <symbol> spontaneous presence seen, primordial expanse ground seized.

[12593] Third,
[12594] <tantra> again from that same source:

[12595] <narrative> Again, in the great land of Yul Khor Yug,
[12596] <narrative> within a great swamp,
[12597] <narrative> one lamp not extinguished dwelt.
[12598] <narrative> Luminous-endowed land,
[12599] <narrative> Teacher Mirror-Possessor saw,
[12500] <narrative> and to him spoke thus:

[12601] <verse> "HO! Listen well, O fortunate one!
[12602] <verse> I shall prophesy to you—listen undistracted!
[12603] <verse> Upon the peak of great Mount Malaya,
[12604] <verse> there is a rimmed ocean called Ocean-Rim-Possessor.
[12605] <verse> Within it, father Light-Protector,
[12606] <verse> and mother Vajra Sow—two
[12607] <verse> siblings arose.
[12608] <narrative> Then father-mother two to the siblings spoke thus:

[12609] <narrative> 'Son, go to the demon land and fetch the mirror!
[12610] <narrative> Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victory palace
[12611] <narrative> and fetch flowers!'
[12612] <narrative> The son said, 'I shall not go.'
[12613] <narrative> Then father-mother said, 'Son, why will you not go?'
[12614] <narrative> The son said, 'In the demon land there is a demon called Black Halika;
[12615] <narrative> if he captures me imprisoned, I cannot go.'

[12616] <narrative> Father-mother said, 'Do not speak thus!
[12617] <narrative> In the demon land there is one called Elder Crone Lingtok;
[12618] <narrative> she is your aunt.
[12619] <narrative> Ask her for fire!'
[12620] <narrative> The son said thus:
[12621] <narrative> 'O father-mother, that land is not mine;
[12622] <narrative> if I go there,
[12623] <narrative> send me five servants,
[12624] <narrative> one sword wrapped in sesame oil cloth,
[12625] <narrative> five mirrors!'
[12626] <narrative> Father-mother two joyfully said, 'Thus it shall be,'
[12627] <narrative> and sent five servants,
[12628] <narrative> sent five mirrors.

[12629] <narrative> Then the son said thus:
[12630] <narrative> 'O father-mother, if I am captured from the demon land, what shall I do?'
[12631] <narrative> Father-mother said,
[12632] <narrative> 'In the land called Jewel-Heap,
[12633] <narrative> there are four low-caste men;
[12634] <narrative> send them as army!
[12635] <narrative> One gather army,
[12636] <narrative> one take iron hook,
[12637] <narrative> two hold door—'
[12638] <narrative> Thus father-mother prophesied.
[12639] <narrative> The son said, 'Thus shall it be done!'
[12640] <narrative> Saying 'E MA HO!' he went.
[12641] <narrative> Then Black Demon Halika saw,
[12642] <narrative> thinking 'A stranger has come,' his retinue seized him saying 'Do not release this one!'
[12643] <narrative> The demon's five men captured him.
[12644] <narrative> Aunt Lingtok put in irons,
[12645] <narrative> saying to the retinue, 'This one killed my son,
[12646] <narrative> do not release him!'
[12647] <narrative> The retinue said, 'Thus shall it be,' and he had no power to go.

[12648] <narrative> Then the son said thus:
[12649] <narrative> 'O aunt, father-mother commanded:
[12650] <narrative> "You have an aunt called Lingtok in the demon land;
[12651] <narrative> go there for fire!"
[12652] <narrative> Do not capture me, release me!'
[12653] <narrative> The old crone said, 'I shall not release you;
[12654] <narrative> you killed my son, I shall not release you.'

[12655] <narrative> Then the son said thus:
[12656] <narrative> 'If you do not release me, I shall call the army!'
[12657] <narrative> Not released.

[12658] <narrative> Then the son sent word to three travelers:
[12659] <narrative> 'O companions, in the land called Jewel-Heap
[12660] <narrative> there are four low-caste men;
[12661] <narrative> go there, and
[12662] <narrative> say that Rigsbyed Prince has been captured, bring many armies!'
[12663] <narrative> Saying 'Thus shall it be,' they went.

[12664] <narrative> Then within three days, as the sun rose,
[12665] <narrative> many armies came, broke the gate,
[12666] <narrative> prison irons cut,
[12667] <narrative> old crone driven out,
[12668] <narrative> five men separated from horses,
[12669] <narrative] aunt's son captured,
[12670] <narrative> retinue heads cut with sword, killed.
[12671] <narrative> Then they fled to their own land.
[12672] <narrative> Arriving in the land, they met the sister bringing many flowers from the thirty-three gods' land.
[12673] <narrative> Then father-mother two recognized them, greatly rejoiced, and gave names to the two siblings:
[12674] <narrative> To the brother they gave the name Vajra-Lasso-Pulling,
[12675] <narrative> To the sister they gave the name Rim-Possessor.
[12676] <narrative> Then the siblings two, consulting together,
[12677] <narrative> saw Teacher Mirror-Possessor,
[12678] <narrative> and he prophesied to them:

[12679] <tantra> 'O noble son, listen!
[12680] <tantra> In the land of Unarranged Appearances,
[12681] <tantra> there is a five-tiered crystal stupa,
[12682] <tantra> upon whose sides five men perform non-virtue.
[12683] <tantra> Around that crystal stupa's wheel,
[12684] <tantra> four silver mirrors are placed.
[12685] <tantra> From Malaya's summit go,
[12686] <tantra> within the rim-wall stay!

[12687] <tantra> Upon the jewel ladder,
[12688] <tantra> taking a vessel filled with jewel contents in hand, ascend!
[12689] <tantra> Then upon the stupa's peak is a teacher called Unchanging Light;
[12690] <tantra> from him a ray of light comes to your right foot.
[12691] <tantra> Without fear, hold it and go!
[12692] <tantra> Then that is your own appearance-father; run there!

[12693] <tantra> Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors;
[12694] <tantra> there your mother variously appears.
[12695] <tantra> At that time you will not recognize your mother.
[12696] <tantra> Beyond that is a house made of various jewels;
[12697] <tantra> that is your abode, seize the ground there!'

[12698] <narrative> Thus the teacher prophesied.
[12699] <narrative> Lasso-Pulling boy said thus:
[12700] <narrative> 'O great teacher, thus shall we do,'
[12701] <narrative> and to his sister said:
[12702] <narrative> 'As the teacher prophesied, we shall do!'

[12703] <narrative> Riding sun-rays,
[12704] <narrative> wearing rainbow saddle,
[12705] <narrative> pearl garland binding chest,
[12706] <narrative> crystal spear in hand,
[12707] <narrative> in sky's center path arose,
[12708] <narrative> without obstacle reached jewel house—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative, and thus it is spoken.

[12709] <meaning> The meaning thereof:
[12710] <symbol> Great land Yul Khor Yug is samsara.
[12711] <symbol> Swamp is

[12750] <symbol> Distinguishing mind and wisdom separates.
[12751] <symbol> Liberating wisdom liberates samsara to expanse.

[12755] <symbol> Demons and retinue capturing is

[12757] <symbol> Aunt relative grieving not releasing is

[12759] <symbol> Three messengers sent is three baskets—

[12761] <symbol> Boy is
[12762] <symbol> Rigpa—bound in samsara,
[12763] <symbol> four lamps summoned as allies, practiced,
[12764] <symbol> army arose, much wisdom and realization born,

[12800] <symbol] kadag's ground spontaneously liberated!

[12801] Fourth,
[12802] <tantra> from Self-Arisen:

[12803] <narrative> Before, in the land of Pure Appearance,
[12804] <narrative> there was a castle with eight doors.
[12805] <narrative> The castle's lord, prince Appearance-Rigsbyed, ruled.
[12806] <narrative> He had a mother called Elder Crone Lingtok.
[12807] <narrative> The land's arrow-protector king called Grags-pa-Dbang-phyug existed.
[12808] <narrative> To him were five princely sons.
[12809] <narrative> Five royal sons went to battle,
[12810] <narrative> Old Crone Lingtok captured in the valley below—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12811] <narrative> Five royal brothers captured—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12812] <narrative> Then going to the daughter-in-law's place, also captured, put in irons—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.

[12813] The meaning thereof:

[12814] <symbol> Land Pure Appearance is Rigpa's pure-land.
[12815] <symbol> Castle eight-doors, spontaneous presence's display-gate having peak,
[12816] <symbol] prince self-arisen Rigpa there,
[12817] <symbol] co-arisen ignorance simultaneously, with old crone together there dwelt.

[12818] <symbol> King is
[12819] <symbol> afflictions' root self-grasping.
[12820] <symbol> Sons are
[12821] <symbol> five poison afflictions.
[12822] <symbol> Battle is
[12823] <symbol> five doors sense-faculties' self-power, attachment-aversion five poisons acting.
[12824] <symbol> Old crone captured is
[12825] <symbol] ignorance own-object afflictions five captured,
[12826] <symbol] five poisons ignorance nature as one become, entering one taste.
[12827] <symbol> This also now self-ignorance's consciousness doors variously appearing,
[12828] <symbol] five poisons meeting means.

[12829] <symbol> Going to daughter-in-law's place, captured is:
[12830] <symbol> ignorance's nature Rigpa-existing,
[12831] <symbol] Rigpa object-before captured,
[12832] <symbol] mind wherever attachment-aversion arises, bound—
[12833] <symbol] that nature Rigpa,
[12834] <symbol] reversal ignorance,
[12835] <symbol] known, self-liberated!

[12836] Fifth: delusion reversal method,
[12837] <tantra> again from that same source:

[12838] <narrative> Before, in the land called Jewel-Heap,
[12839] <narrative> an old crone had one precious jewel.
[12840] <narrative> Five thieves stole it, old crone sorrow-captured—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12841] <narrative> Then thieves trace cut,
[12842] <narrative> went to Thorny land,
[12843] <narrative> five thieves stole, old crone fainted—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
[12844] <narrative> Then thieves from Thorny land trace cut,
[12845] <narrative> old crone fainted-awoke—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.

[12846] <narrative> Then that old crone's daughter called Fire-God White said thus:
[12847] <narrative> 'Has my jewel been lost?'
[12848] <narrative> The five men said,
[12849] <narrative> 'The jewel is not lost; you yourself kill the old crone!
[12850] <narrative> If old crone mother not killed, jewel not given,' they said.
[12851] <narrative> He killed his own mother, ate flesh,
[12852] <narrative> drank blood,
[12853] <narrative> bones buried,
[12854] <narrative> made non-existent,
[12855] <narrative> jewel thieves gave—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative, the meaning thereof:

[12856] <symbol> Land Jewel-Heap is citta.
[12857] <symbol> Old crone is non-recognition.
[12858] <symbol> Jewel is Rigpa.
[12859] <symbol> Thieves are five poisons.

[12860] <symbol> Sorrow-captured: Rigpa attachment-aversion contaminated, self-suffering self-not-experienced.
[12861] <symbol> Trace cut, Thorny land cut, old crone fainted:
[12862] <symbol] wisdom examining Rigpa and its co-arisen ignorance five poisons with delusion,
[12863] <symbol] now samsara circling, recognized,
[12864] <symbol] ignorance five poisons' latency merely dwelling.

[12865] <symbol> Thus delusion's root cut, Rigpa self-face known,
[12866] <symbol] ignorance self-clear went is:
[12867] <symbol] trace cut, fainted-awoke.

[12868] <symbol> Fire-God is
[12869] <symbol] self-face known wisdom arisen,
[12870] <symbol] 'Jewel lost?' asked,
[12871] <symbol] 'Kill old crone, then give,' saying given is:
[12872] <symbol] Rigpa self samsara gone, self-face bad gone examined,
[12873] <symbol] hair- pores also not moved,
[12874] <symbol] complexion hue corner not broken seen,
[12875] <symbol] co-arisen self-face ignorance's part not abandoned, that not beneficial,
[12876] <symbol] still samsara not transcended prior-mixing one.
[12877] <symbol> Five poisons self-arisen to self appearing, recognized,
[12878] <symbol] mouth within self-face examined,
[12879] <symbol] self-rigpa time co-arisen's ignorance clear,
[12880] <symbol] conceptions self-liberated, flesh eaten, anger not abandoned, place pure.
[12881] <symbol] Attachment-clinging pure, blood drunk.
[12882] <symbol] Non-knowing pure, bones buried.
[12883] <symbol] All afflictions non-existent gone,
[12884] <symbol] within Rigpa examined,
[12885] <symbol] self-rigpa time,
[12886] <symbol] outer-object appearing five poisons co-arisen ignorance with pure,
[12887] <symbol] self-arisen wisdom's jewel self-found time!

[12888] Sixth,
[12889] <tantra> from Self-Arisen:

[12890] <narrative> Before, in the land of Subjugation-Arranged,
[12891] <narrative> Chinese king Ligarta, having cast great dice,
[12892] <narrative] divined,
[12893] <narrative] reverse as beautiful ornament put twenty-one queens,
[12894] <narrative] great road's four-crossroads sent, death decided—<symbol> thus the symbolic narrative.
