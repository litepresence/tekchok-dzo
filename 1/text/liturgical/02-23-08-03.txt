[14590] Third, regarding liberation: This is the criterion for release.
[14591] The scriptural citation:
[14592] <prose><tantra>From the Wisdom Lamp:
[14593] <verse>Momentary recognition divides in half,
[14594] <verse>Meditation days comprise the abiding portion.
[14595] <verse>Through the distinction of endowed and non-endowed,
[14596] <verse>Mixed and similar, yet unmixed—possessing such.
[14597] <verse>Thus it is clearly shown.
[14598] Here, according to our own tradition, the classification of aspects of momentary recognition is pervaded by recognition of one's own face,
[14599] Yet meditation days are not pervaded by realization, || 10 ||
[14600] For even without realization, one may abide in natural contemplation.
[14601] This is like the end of spontaneous presence.
[14602] Moreover, momentary recognition is not pervaded by meditation,
[14603] For in the moment of realization, one is liberated into primordial purity.
[14604] There exists a limit connected with meditation, from the peak of the supreme to the final.
[14605] Meditation days are not pervaded by momentary recognition, like the final delusion of the final.
[14606] There exists a limit unconnected with momentary recognition,
[14607] Like the middle and the middle of the final.
[14608] Therefore, momentary recognition and
[14609] Meditation days—dividing these is most crucial. || 20 ||
[14610] Regarding meditation days, some hold them as present days, yet this is utterly unsuitable,
[14611] Unworthy of refutation by scripture and reasoning,
[14612] For they are not even worth the effort of refutation.
[14613] From the Definitive Distinction:
[14614] <verse>Erroneous paths are limitless,
[14615] <verse>These here are not to be engaged.
[14616] <verse>Thus it is taught.
[14617] Erroneous conceptions may resemble, yet refute delusion.
[14618] What is utterly unsuitable is the web of all elaborations, already made into a realm of shame for the wise—what is to be done here?
[14619] Those proclaiming the Victor's words become fools themselves, like the Victor—such delusion should be turned back to its own side. || 30 ||
[14620] Here, meditation days are calculated as the duration of contemplative stability,
[14621] And in the intermediate state as well, the duration of contemplative stability is taught as meditation days.
[14622] Third, the extensive explanation of the manner of faculties' liberation, having three divisions:
[14623] <list>Superior faculties,
[14624] <list>Middling,
[14625] <list>Inferior in sequence.
[14626] The first has seven aspects:
[14627] Perfection of the supreme,
[14628] Liberated without connection to meditation days in three moments,
[14629] Others, more or less connected with meditation days, are liberated in three moments. || 40 ||
[14630] Like a shooting star racing through space, entering self-appearance as primordial purity, through the radiance of emanation's own light, emptying the samsara of sentient beings in the realm of spontaneous presence's self-appearance, one is liberated.
[14631] Moreover, from that own place of primordial purity, emanation does not diverge,
[14632] For this is the ground transcending coarse Appearance of Body and pristine cognition.
[14633] Emanation diverging below, performing the actual benefit of sentient beings, arises from the ground-appearance of spontaneous presence shining forth from primordial purity.
[14634] Diverging from the Path, through holding the body of great transference and
[14635] Traversing natural emanation, one benefits sentient beings of other continuums from oneself.
[14636] The manner of emanation diverging in the intermediate state appears to perform that benefit through the door of spontaneous presence from self-appearance as samsara—
[14637] Know this as similar to having benefited sentient beings in a dream, without actual benefit arising for others beyond mere self-appearance.
[14638] This ground is a unique philosophical tenet of the special Great Perfection, making it somewhat difficult to realize.
[14639] When making three moments, in the first, the sphere-appearance together with the four pristine cognitions and their connections ceases. || 50 ||
