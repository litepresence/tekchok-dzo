[5242] <ornament>First, regarding the progressive arising of kayas from spheres:</ornament>
[5243] <prose>Within each Sphere, half-bodies dawn—
Manifest through complete purification of Emanation Body;
Then single bodies self-arise,
Born of directly perceiving Dharmata's nature.</prose>
[5244] <prose>Then those bodies transform as five Fathers, five Mothers,
The Enjoyment Body's wisdom having reached Its Measure.</prose>
[5245] <prose>Then vision dawns with individual heaps and mandala complete,</prose>
[5246] <prose>Peripheral walls and sovereign hosts appearing,</prose>
[5247] <prose>Thus vision of Reality Body's purification reaching fullness.</prose> || 10 ||
[5248] <prose>This is the Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure:</prose>
[5249] <prose>In the time of preliminaries, actions and activities of the body,</prose>
[5250] <prose>Their connections—signs they shall not arise again.</prose>
[5251] <prose>Though these visions dawn through reaching vital points of preliminaries,</prose>
[5252] <prose>Through antidotes purifying defilements to be cleansed—
Designated as causal fruit of separation,
The causal nexus of purifier and purified—</prose>
[5253] <prose>They do not arise from being produced,</prose>
[5254] <prose>For wisdom's self-existing resonance appears through force of purification.</prose> || 20 ||
[5255] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>
[5256] <verse>The Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure—</verse>
[5257] <verse>Sambhogakaya's marks and signs clearly manifest</verse>
[5258] <verse>From rainbow lights of indeterminate hue;</verse>
[5259] <verse>The five families appear as Fathers and Mothers.</verse>
[5260] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5261] <tantra>From the Bstan bu:</tantra>
[5262] <verse>From such bodies to their utmost limit,</verse>
[5263] <verse>Six, ten, and five-three—</verse>
[5264] <verse>Without doubt, this is Sambhogakaya.</verse>
[5265] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5266] <ornament>Second, explanation of nature in particular:</ornament>
[5267] <prose>The definition of "measure-arrived" generally explained,</prose>
[5268] <prose>And the three measures explained in particular—two topics.</prose>
