[5242] First, behold the cessation of outer vision:
[5243] Within each Sphere, half-bodies dawn—

[5247] Regarding the manner of this vision and the explanation of its nature—
[5248] These bodies transform as five Fathers, five Mothers,

[5265] The five families appear as Fathers and Mothers.
[5266] <prose><tantra>From the Bstan bu:
[5267] From such bodies to their utmost limit,
[5268] Six, ten, and five-three—
