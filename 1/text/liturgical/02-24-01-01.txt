[15275] Those of final faculties—beings most refined—or those lesser who yet failed to recognize truth when dharma-nature bardo arose before them:
[15276] When the path appears within the becoming bardo, dreamlike,
[15277] Recognition dawns: "I have died."
[15278] Remembering their wavering in that bardo state,
[15279] They recall the guru and instructions received—
[15280] Resolving, "Now I go unto the field of natural emanation"—
[15281] Through blessing of dharma-nature truth previously realized,
[15282] And through absence of self-grasping stain, propensities exhaust;
[15283] Miraculously they arise upon a lotus in that field, instantly born, liberated.
[15284] From the Sun-Moon Conjunction Tantra:
[15285] "By remembering the birthplace, those of final faculties exhale into the three natural emanation body fields."
[15286] Furthermore:
[15287] <verse> "O Teacher, Vajra Mind—
[15288] When those of final faculties behold this,
[15289] Does bardo itself appear,
[15290] Or not appear? What say you?"
[15291] <verse> "The Teacher declares: It appears—
[15292] Self-grasping propensities exhausted,
[15293] Exhaled into natural emanation,
[15294] Without bardo, Buddha attained."
[15295] The preliminary instruction for this is:
[15296] Habituate daytime to direct perception of self-appearance;
[15297] At nighttime, habituate five lights within the heart, then sleep looking toward the emanation field.
[15298] Train power through transference during intervals.
[15299] When wisdom-consciousness riding wind projects from heart—or from eyes to chief heart-center—into emanation field through this crucial point,
[15300] You cut through bardo's dangerous precipice, transferring from one excellent dwelling to another, faultless.
[15301] At death's moment, when wind goes out ungathered, establish clear focus and project with HIG—
[15302] From the Sun-Moon Conjunction:
[15303] <verse> "Manner of entering pure fields:
[15304] Dwelling-transference, dwelling-entry—
[15305] Train consciousness riding wind.
[15306] That going above is precious;
[15307] Gathering, projecting awareness precious—
[15308] This is projection with HIG."
[15309] Thus.
[15310] Through practicing thus, some are born directly into the pure field itself.

[15311] Though path arises from hundred-path bardo, recognition of becoming bardo comes;
[15312] At that time, merely remembering that field, one is born through dharma-nature's blessing—
[15313] No hidden instruction exists.
[15314] Regarding the manner of exhaling into natural emanation:
[15315] "Nature" has two aspects:
[15316] The nature of abiding, and
[15317] The nature of enumeration.
[15318] Abiding nature thus:
[15319] From primordial time this abides as path-appearance;
[15320] Four directions of enjoyment-body gate, spontaneous ground-appearance.
[15321] Though eleven exist—ten fields with great charnel-ground burning mountain at center—
[15322] Here five are recognized: great exhaling of liberation.
[15323] Enumeration nature:
[15324] By means of the ten perfections, one reaches the eleventh universal light ground—the special ground of Buddha-appearance.
[15325] Here one hears the Buddha's speech, yet
[15326] The bodhisattvas are obscured by knowable obscurations and do not see the body;
[15327] When they see that body, knowable obscurations are exhausted and they are considered Buddhas.
[15328] This itself is also named the Dharma Body of accumulated merit.
[15329] Therefore, from the Six Spheres Tantra:
[15330] <verse> "The merit-accumulated Dharma Body
[15331] And omniscient wisdom—
[15332] Similar, similar indeed, O treasure!"
[15333] Thus.
[15334] "Emanation" thus:
[15335] Four fields with center—five—emanation fields of five Buddha families.
[15336] Eastern field called Manifest Joy:
[15337] Teacher Vajra Unshakable with retinue of bodhisattvas, boys and girls, white, miraculously born;
[15338] They move through sky,
[15339] Celestial palace possessing immeasurable excellence,
[15340] Various emanation birds proclaiming sweet voices,
[15341] Scent of excellent fragrance, jewel trees infinite adorning—
[15342] Teacher's speech liberates retinue's continuum; excellence inconceivable.
[15343] Southern field Glorious Possessing:
[15344] Teacher Jewel Source with retinue, miraculously arisen bodhisattvas, boys and girls, yellow;
[15345] Ground all jewel gold,
[15346] Possessing immeasurable excellence.
[15347] Western field Lotus Piled:
[15348] Teacher Infinite Light with retinue, miraculously arisen bodhisattvas, all red;
[15349] Emanation birds, deer, horses, elephants possess very red radiance.
[15350] Northern field Action Fully Completed:
[15351] Teacher Meaning Accomplished with measureless retinue, emanation creatures, all green, shining;
[15352] Ground all jewel emerald and indranila nature.
[15353] Sky before center of all these: great charnel-ground Burning Mountain—
[15354] Emanation wrathful field. Merely seeing this profound Dharma's door, those of final faculties exhale into their classes;
[15355] From there, in five hundred years, unique Buddhahood obtained, no bardo.
[15356] From Great Arrangement of Ati:
[15357] <verse> "Five hundredfold degenerate age's end,
[15358] Secret essence appears in human realm;
[15359] Capable persons holding it subsequently—
[15360] To whom appears this essence?
[15361] They traverse unchanging ground.
[15362] If through degenerate times, short life, diseases,
[15363] Confidence in essential meaning unarisen,
[15364] Yet seeing this itself, great exhaling occurs—
[15365] Eleventh universal light, that emanation field,
[15366] Miraculously born, pure, womb-confinement separated.
[15367] Eastern Manifest Joy, unchanging vajra field,
[15368] Unshakable Teacher liberates retinue's knowing continuum;
[15369] Disciples' self-appearance, excellence inconceivable.
[15370] Glorious Possessing, Lotus Piled,
[15371] Action Supreme, fully completed field,
[15372] Jewel Source, Lotus Dance-Horse,
[15373] Meaning Accomplished Teacher purifies knowable obscurations.
[15374] White, yellow, red, green—colors clear,
[15375] Presence-pleasing, mind-pleasing, bird voices proclaiming,
[15376] Fragrance gentle—beyond description;
[15377] Faculties pleased, excellence possessed.
[15378] Color complete, body complete; food, clothes complete in one;
[15379] Body effort-free, wind-moved, going, abiding.
[15380] No wind, bile, phlegm diseases, no combinations;
[15381] Water eight-limbed, hundred tastes—
[15382] Drinking pleases; body softens.
[15383] Earth, water, fire, wind arise, benefit and harm separated;
[15384] Hunger, thirst, heat, cold dispelled.
[15385] Desire, aversion, delusion, afflictions—
[15386] No birth-cause arises; mind relaxed.
[15387] Looking, smiling, holding, embracing—no attachment;
[15388] Satisfaction, craving-free, always hearing Dharma;
[15389] Two obscurations separated, bound by one birth;
[15390] Offering goddesses speak auspicious words.
[15391] Celestial palace beautiful, four doors, horse-canopies;
[15392] Crystal, gold, emerald, indranila;
[15393] Auspicious umbrellas, wheels, banners beautiful.
[15394] Thus nature in ten directions, emanation fields—
[15395] Self-teachers tame self-retinuess;
[15396] Before, in sky of Endurance Piled,
[15397] Terrifying wrathful place, charnel-ground burning;
[15398] Terrifying sounds, wrathful forms—Alala!
[15399] Merely by seeing this, liberation occurs;
[15400] Capable, powerless, holding the essential meaning—
[15401] There exhale, one birth,
[15402] In five hundred, liberated into the ground of certainty."
[15403] Thus.
[15404] Places and arrangements explained extensively:
[15405] From Self-Arising Awareness Great Tantra:

[15606] Continuum of those fields: self-radiance of self-luminous wisdom jewel, mirror-like and so forth in heart center;
[15607] From appearance abiding primordially in wrathful mandala, skull-house, it arose.
[15608] For retinue: appearance,
[15609] Cause capable of being seen by lowest faculties,
[15610] Cause of certain liberation—know as that.
[15611] <tantra> From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle:
[15612] <tantra> "Sending those of final faculties to natural emanation-body field—Twenty-Fourth Lecture Hall."
[15613] Thus, extensively explained ground and path steps of liberation through essential points of certain secret supreme meaning,

[15620] Ascertaining arising basis of body and wisdom.
[15621] First:
[15622] Self-arisen awareness, pure by nature, pure of all adventitious stains;
