[15275] Those of final faculties—beings most refined—or those lesser who yet failed to recognize truth when dharma-nature bardo arose before them:
[15276] When the path appears within the becoming bardo, dreamlike,
[15277] Recognition dawns: "I have died."
[15278] Remembering their wavering in that bardo state,
[15279] They recall the guru and instructions received—
[15280] Resolving, "Now I go unto the field of natural emanation"—
[15281] Through blessing of dharma-nature truth previously realized,
[15282] And through absence of self-grasping stain, propensities exhaust;
[15283] Miraculously they arise upon a lotus in that field, instantly born, liberated.
[15284] From the Sun-Moon Conjunction Tantra:
[15285] "By remembering the birthplace, those of final faculties exhale into the three natural emanation body fields."
[15286] Furthermore:
[15287] <verse> "O Teacher, Vajra Mind—
[15288] When those of final faculties behold this,
[15289] Does bardo itself appear,
[15290] Or not appear? What say you?"
[15291] <verse> "The Teacher declares: It appears—
[15292] Self-grasping propensities exhausted,
[15293] Exhaled into natural emanation,
[15294] Without bardo, Buddha attained."
[15295] The preliminary instruction for this is:
[15296] Habituate daytime to direct perception of self-appearance;
[15297] At nighttime, habituate five lights within the heart, then sleep looking toward the emanation field.
[15298] Train power through transference during intervals.
[15299] When wisdom-consciousness riding wind projects from heart—or from eyes to chief heart-center—into emanation field through this crucial point,
[15300] You cut through bardo's dangerous precipice, transferring from one excellent dwelling to another, faultless.
[15301] At death's moment, when wind goes out ungathered, establish clear focus and project with HIG—
[15302] From the Sun-Moon Conjunction:
[15303] <verse> "Manner of entering pure fields:
[15304] Dwelling-transference, dwelling-entry—
[15305] Train consciousness riding wind.
[15306] That going above is precious;
[15307] Gathering, projecting awareness precious—
[15308] This is projection with HIG."
[15309] Thus.
[15310] Through practicing thus, some are born directly into the pure field itself.

[15311] Though path arises from hundred-path bardo, recognition of becoming bardo comes;
[15312] At that time, merely remembering that field, one is born through dharma-nature's blessing—
[15313] No hidden instruction exists.
[15314] Regarding the manner of exhaling into natural emanation:
[15315] "Nature" has two aspects:
[15316] The nature of abiding, and
[15317] The nature of enumeration.
[15318] Abiding nature thus:
[15319] From primordial time this abides as path-appearance;
[15320] Four directions of enjoyment-body gate, spontaneous ground-appearance.
[15321] Though eleven exist—ten fields with great charnel-ground burning mountain at center—
[15322] Here five are recognized: great exhaling of liberation.
[15323] Enumeration nature:
[15324] By means of the ten perfections, one reaches the eleventh universal light ground—the special ground of Buddha-appearance.
[15325] Here one hears the Buddha's speech, yet
[15326] The bodhisattvas are obscured by knowable obscurations and do not see the body;
[15327] When they see that body, knowable obscurations are exhausted and they are considered Buddhas.
[15328] This itself is also named the Dharma Body of accumulated merit.
[15329] Therefore, from the Six Spheres Tantra:
[15330] <verse> "The merit-accumulated Dharma Body
[15331] And omniscient wisdom—
[15332] Similar, similar indeed, O treasure!"
[15333] Thus.
[15334] "Emanation" thus:
[15335] Four fields with center—five—emanation fields of five Buddha families.
[15336] Eastern field called Manifest Joy:
[15337] Teacher Vajra Unshakable with retinue of bodhisattvas, boys and girls, white, miraculously born;
[15338] They move through sky,
[15339] Celestial palace possessing immeasurable excellence,
[15340] Various emanation birds proclaiming sweet voices,
[15341] Scent of excellent fragrance, jewel trees infinite adorning—
[15342] Teacher's speech liberates retinue's continuum; excellence inconceivable.
[15343] Southern field Glorious Possessing:
[15344] Teacher Jewel Source with retinue, miraculously arisen bodhisattvas, boys and girls, yellow;
[15345] Ground all jewel gold,
[15346] Possessing immeasurable excellence.
[15347] Western field Lotus Piled:
[15348] Teacher Infinite Light with retinue, miraculously arisen bodhisattvas, all red;
[15349] Emanation birds, deer, horses, elephants possess very red radiance.
[15350] Northern field Action Fully Completed:
[15351] Teacher Meaning Accomplished with measureless retinue, emanation creatures, all green, shining;
[15352] Ground all jewel emerald and indranila nature.
[15353] Sky before center of all these: great charnel-ground Burning Mountain—
[15354] Emanation wrathful field. Merely seeing this profound Dharma's door, those of final faculties exhale into their classes;
[15355] From there, in five hundred years, unique Buddhahood obtained, no bardo.
[15356] From Great Arrangement of Ati:
[15357] <verse> "Five hundredfold degenerate age's end,
[15358] Secret essence appears in human realm;
[15359] Capable persons holding it subsequently—
[15360] To whom appears this essence?
[15361] They traverse unchanging ground.
[15362] If through degenerate times, short life, diseases,
[15363] Confidence in essential meaning unarisen,
[15364] Yet seeing this itself, great exhaling occurs—
[15365] Eleventh universal light, that emanation field,
[15366] Miraculously born, pure, womb-confinement separated.
[15367] Eastern Manifest Joy, unchanging vajra field,
[15368] Unshakable Teacher liberates retinue's knowing continuum;
[15369] Disciples' self-appearance, excellence inconceivable.
[15370] Glorious Possessing, Lotus Piled,
[15371] Action Supreme, fully completed field,
[15372] Jewel Source, Lotus Dance-Horse,
[15373] Meaning Accomplished Teacher purifies knowable obscurations.
[15374] White, yellow, red, green—colors clear,
[15375] Presence-pleasing, mind-pleasing, bird voices proclaiming,
[15376] Fragrance gentle—beyond description;
[15377] Faculties pleased, excellence possessed.
[15378] Color complete, body complete; food, clothes complete in one;
[15379] Body effort-free, wind-moved, going, abiding.
[15380] No wind, bile, phlegm diseases, no combinations;
[15381] Water eight-limbed, hundred tastes—
[15382] Drinking pleases; body softens.
[15383] Earth, water, fire, wind arise, benefit and harm separated;
[15384] Hunger, thirst, heat, cold dispelled.
[15385] Desire, aversion, delusion, afflictions—
[15386] No birth-cause arises; mind relaxed.
[15387] Looking, smiling, holding, embracing—no attachment;
[15388] Satisfaction, craving-free, always hearing Dharma;
[15389] Two obscurations separated, bound by one birth;
[15390] Offering goddesses speak auspicious words.
[15391] Celestial palace beautiful, four doors, horse-canopies;
[15392] Crystal, gold, emerald, indranila;
[15393] Auspicious umbrellas, wheels, banners beautiful.
[15394] Thus nature in ten directions, emanation fields—
[15395] Self-teachers tame self-retinuess;
[15396] Before, in sky of Endurance Piled,
[15397] Terrifying wrathful place, charnel-ground burning;
[15398] Terrifying sounds, wrathful forms—Alala!
[15399] Merely by seeing this, liberation occurs;
[15400] Capable, powerless, holding the essential meaning—
[15401] There exhale, one birth,
[15402] In five hundred, liberated into the ground of certainty."
[15403] Thus.
[15404] If the places and arrangements of these are explained extensively:
[15405] From the Self-Arising Awareness Great Tantra:
[15406] In the eastern world realm from here,
[15407] There exists the field called Manifest Joy;
[15408] In that emanation body field,
[15409] There is the emanation body called Vajra Mind—
[15410] The place where all Thus-Gone Ones receive empowerment;
[15411] The celestial palace has immeasurable excellence.
[15412] It is thus:
[15413] A house made of jewel crystal, possessing four doors,
[15414] Possessing jewel horse-canopies;
[15415] The ground all is made of jewel crystal,
[15416] Very mind-pleasing,
[15417] Beautiful to behold,
[15418] With steps,
[15419] Possessing windows,
[15420] With four great opening windows in the four directions;
[15421] Through the opening windows the sun arises,
[15422] Striking the jewel crystal,
[15423] And inside, the appearance of five lights freely appears during the day.
[15424] On the outer rim of that celestial palace
[15425] Exists a water moat possessing eight limbs;
[15426] When those stricken with disease drink that water, disease is healed,
[15427] And on its outer rim are eight lakes;
[15428] Inside these also are birds with various sweet voices.
[15429] These are thus:
[15430] The bird king Gold-Possessing Swan,
[15431] Black-Neck,
[15432] Bya-ka-ti,
[15433] Ne-tsho who knows human speech,
[15434] Cuckoo,
[15435] Shang-shang-te'u,
[15436] Re-skegs,
[15437] And so forth—a hundred thousand kinds of birds with sweet voices;
[15438] Mind-pleasing bird kinds thus:
[15439] Kang-ka-ri,
[15440] Sba-ba,
[15441] Zer-mo,
[15442] Divine bird possessing bell voice,
[15443] Bya-kri-ti-pa of golden vajra form, and so forth—
[15444] Blue like turquoise color,
[15445] White like conch color,
[15446] Red like coral color,
[15447] Green like indranila, and so forth—
[15448] Mind-pleasing,
[15449] With sweet voices, inconceivable.
[15450] On its outer rim is an iron wall of seven jewels;
[15451] In the center of that is a throne made of seven jewels, possessing a seat for explaining Dharma.
[15452] There, that emanation body called Vajra Mind
[15453] Explains causal Dharma to the retinue in the morning;
[15454] At noon, mantra dog Dharma;
[15455] At dawn, inner Dharma;
[15456] At solar noon, Great Completion supreme result Dharma.
[15457] Thus four Dharma sessions arise each day.
[15458] The bodhisattvas abiding there are mostly bound by one birth,
[15459] Sustaining life for five hundred fifty years.
[15460] In that field-realm, food and thirst are satisfied by mere memory;
[15461] There, no weariness exists—supreme bliss within.
[15462] Even in existence, drinking that water possessing eight limbs cleanses.
[15463] With various flowers they extensively worship that emanation body.
[15464] At the four corners of that celestial palace are four stupas made of pearl;
[15465] Between those four are connected by threads of tinkling bell nets;
[15466] When the wind moves those threads,
[15467] The bell sounds, various and mind-pleasing, emerge.
[15468] In the four directions are four banners of various silk;
[15469] When the wind moves these, various pleasing fragrances emerge.
[15470] That celestial palace exists five hundred leagues to the east from here.
[15471] The bodhisattvas born there enjoy equally with the thirty-three gods.
[15472] Thus it is in the eastern emanation body field.
[15473] From here, in the southern field called Glorious Possessing,
[15474] A house made of jewel gold, four-cornered, possessing balconies,
[15475] Four doors possessing horse-projections,
[15476] Four corners possessing stupas,
[15477] Four sides possessing banners,
[15478] Four directions possessing windows,
[15479] Seven lakes possessing birds,
[15480] Water possessing eight limbs, possessing an iron mountain;
[15481] Throne and Dharma also explained as above.
[15482] Those bodhisattvas are bound by one birth,
[15483] And in that emanation body Jewel Source field-realm, such excellence exists.
[15484] From here, in the western Lotus Stacked field-realm,
[15485] There exists the emanation body called Infinite Light;
[15486] There also, excellence equal to the above exists.
[15487] From here, in the northern world realm,
[15488] There exists the field called Jewel Various Arrangement;
[15489] There also, in the emanation body field called Meaningful Accomplishment,
[15490] Such excellence of celestial measure exists:
[15491] A house made of jewel indranila, four-cornered,
[15492] Also possessing four great windows in the four directions;
[15493] From there the sun rises, filling the inside with green light.
[15494] The ground all is also made of indranila;
[15495] On its outer layer is water possessing eight limbs;
[15496] That water, when touched, is bliss;
[15497] When drunk, all disease is cleansed.
[15498] On its outer rim are seven lakes;
[15499] Inside these dwell birds with various pleasant sounds.
[15500] These are thus:
[15501] The bird king Gold-Possessing Goose,
[15502] Thing-ril,
[15503] Bird ka-ta-ri,
[15504] Peacock,
[15505] Ne-tsho knowing human speech,
[15506] Cuckoo,
[15507] Shang-shang-te'u,
[15508] Re-skegs,
[15509] And so forth—eighty thousand kinds of birds with pleasant sounds;
[15510] Mind-pleasing bird kinds thus:
[15511] Kang-ka-ri,
[15512] Zer-mo,
[15513] Sba-ba,
[15514] Divine bird possessing bell sound,
[15515] Bird kri-ti-pa of golden vajra form, and so forth—
[15516] Including these:
[15517] Blue like turquoise color,
[15518] White like conch color,
[15519] Red like coral color,
[15520] Green like indranila color,
[15521] And so forth—mind-pleasing,
[15522] With pleasant sounds, inconceivable.
[15523] On its outer layer is an iron mountain of seven jewels;
[15524] In the middle of those is a throne made of jewel margadala, possessing a seat for explaining Dharma.
[15525] There, that emanation body called Meaningful Accomplishment
[15526] Teaches instruction Dharma at dusk;
[15527] At midnight, empowerment Dharma;
[15528] At dawn, conduct Dharma;
[15529] At noon, view-meditation Dharma.
[15530] Thus, with four Dharma sessions each day, he liberates the retinue's mindstream.
[15531] The bodhisattvas dwelling there are also bound by one birth,
[15532] Attaining life for a thousand years.
[15533] In that field-realm, food and thirst are satisfied by mere memory.
[15534] From that, phlegm-produced diseases,
[15535] Wind-produced,
[15536] Bile-produced,
[15537] Combination-produced diseases do not exist.
[15538] With various flowers they extensively worship that emanation body.
[15539] Those bodhisattvas are green in color,
[15540] Horses and mounts also green,
[15541] Boys and girls in form, merely appearing;
[15542] All have no aspect of mental thought.
[15543] In that field-realm, three types of sentient beings do not exist;
[15544] Six sense-bases do not exist;
[15545] Six afflictions do not exist;
[15546] Ignorance does not exist;
[15547] Four conditions with possessing do not exist;
[15548] Mind similar to ignorance with possessing does not exist;
[15549] All are merely free from thought.
[15550] The qualities of the retinue of the celestial palace:
[15551] At the four corners of this celestial palace
[15552] Are four crystal jewel stupas of nine stories;
[15553] Between them all are connected by gold bell tinkling nets;
[15554] When the wind moves these, various pleasant bell sounds emerge.
[15555] The four stupas are connected by five-light ropes struck by the sun;
[15556] In the four directions are four peacock banners;
[15557] When the wind moves these, various mind-pleasing beauties emerge.
[15558] Such immeasurable excellence exists.
[15559] That celestial palace exists five hundred leagues to the north from here.
[15560] The bodhisattvas born there enjoy equally with the form realm gods.
[15561] Thus it is in the northern emanation body field.
[15562] Before those fields, in space, is the emanation body wrathful field:
[15563] The great charnel-ground called Blazing Mountain exists;
[15564] That also has such a celestial palace:
[15565] A house of skullcups possessing four cubits,
[15566] Thus:
[15567] Fruit made of dry skullcups,
[15568] Walls made of flesh and internal organs,
[15569] Covering made of bandha tala leaves,
[15570] Width and height immeasurable,
[15571] Meteoric iron nails affixed,
[15572] Rakta dripping water falling,
[15573] Sun and moon as seat,
[15574] Sea-monster mouth as arch,
[15575] Eight great gods arrayed as pillars,
[15576] The supreme great foundation laid.
[15577] By day, wind swirling;
[15578] By night, fire blazing;
[15579] At the four corners of that celestial palace, great field canopies spread;
[15580] Five goddesses dancing;
[15581] The ground all is a churning ocean of rakta.
[15582] Inside that celestial palace
[15583] Is the Bhagavan called Youth Hero Power-Possessing,
[15584] Whose mind, though unmoved from peacefulness,
[15585] Displays the aspect of a wrathful body,
[15586] With dakinis
[15587] And a measureless assembly of wrathful ones surrounding him.
[15588] These are thus:
[15589] Dakini Purna Near Peaceful,
[15590] Brahma Conch-Throat,
[15591] Rishi Moon-Light Youth,
[15592] Also the retinue dakinis E-ka-tsi-ti six siblings,
[15593] Their fourteen servant women,
[15594] Fifty-eight attendants,
[15595] Also attendants ten thousand, hundred thousand, thousand to including—
[15596] A measureless retinue of dakinis surrounding.
[15597] The retinue emanated from that Bhagavan's mind—Vajra-in-Hand and so forth,
[15598] Surrounded by a measureless assembly of wrathful ones,
[15599] And Delight-Vajra and so forth—a measureless human retinue.
[15600] Turning the wheel of secret mantra supreme Dharma for the retinue,
[15601] Liberating the peaceful emanation body bodhisattvas,
[15602] All possessing wrathful garlands.
[15603] That celestial palace possesses very vast extent.
[15604] Those persons of final faculties,
[15605] Bewildered and fearing there, take birth into the emanation body field—thus it was spoken.
[15606] These are also arranged by nature through the blessing of the Victorious Vajra-Holder; therefore they are called natural emanation fields.
[15607] The continuum of those fields is the self-radiance of the self-luminous wisdom jewel, mirror-like and so forth in the heart center;
[15608] From the appearance abiding from primordial time in the wrathful mandala in the skull-house, it arose.
[15609] For the retinue, appearance,
[15610] And cause capable of being seen by those of lowest faculties,
[15611] And cause of certain liberation also should be known as that.
[15612] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[15613] <tantra> "Sending those of final faculties to the natural emanation body field—this is the Twenty-Fourth Lecture Hall."
[15614] Thus, having extensively explained the ground and path steps of liberation through essential points of certain secret supreme meaning,
[15615] Now, as to where that method attains completion—the fruit step to be ascertained—there are two:
[15616] The general presentation of the manner of manifest enlightenment upon the ground of inner primordially pure space, and
[15617] The specific explanation of the appearance manner of body and wisdom from the arising basis of spontaneously accomplished luminosity.
[15618] The first has three aspects:
[15619] Holding with the essence of the place of liberation,
[15620] Explaining individually the nature of how liberation occurs,
[15621] And ascertaining the arising basis of body and wisdom.
[15622] The first:
[15623] Self-arisen awareness, pure by nature, is pure of all adventitious stains;
[15624] The twofold purity, the non-dual space and wisdom of the Dharma Body—the primordially pure jewel secret recess—is the ultimate place of liberation.
[15625] From Self-Arising:
[15626] "The place of liberation is the appearance of primordial purity;
[15627] Like the example of a vase body."
[15628] "The sending-place of all Buddhas
[15629] Is the mandala of great primordial purity."
[15630] Thus.
[15631] From the Jewel Heap:
[15632] "The fruit, the Dharma Body, in emptiness—
[15633] The ceasing of entities is most wondrous."
[15634] Thus.
