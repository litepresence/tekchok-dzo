[16770] The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities:
[16771] Body appearing to beings as appropriate, yet each's own aspect's marks and signs perfected;
[16772] Speech: well-connected sixty limbs' sound arrangement;
[16773] Mind: knowing extent of things as they are and as they appear;
[16774] Qualities: perfected knowing of powers and so forth's dharmas without remainder;
[16775] Activities: turning the wheel of five perfections' nature—external, internal, and secret Dharma-wheels.

<tantra> [16776] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16777] "Emanation-kāya too: body, speech, mind,
<tantra> [16778] Qualities, activities—five aspects.
<tantra> [16779] Body: marks and signs,
<tantra> [16780] Whichever body arises for those to be trained.
<tantra> [16781] Speech: well-connected words,
<tantra> [16782] Brahma's Expanse: six limbs.
<tantra> [16783] Mind: through knower-known wisdom,
<tantra> [16784] Abides intending self-other benefit.
<tantra> [16785] Qualities: perfected knowing,
<tantra> [16786] Activities: external, internal, secret,
<tantra> [16787] Deeds completely perfected,
<tantra> [16788] Abide as five perfections."
<tantra> [16789] Thus it is spoken.

[16790] These too: external five perfections:
[16791] Perfect field: Vulture Peak;
[16792] Perfect teacher: Śākyamuni;
[16793] Perfect Dharma: various vehicles;
[16794] Perfect retinue: common and uncommon;
[16795] Perfect time: hundred-year lifespan.

[16796] Internal five perfections:
[16797] Perfect field: Akaniṣṭha;
[16798] Perfect teacher: Vajradhara;
[16799] Perfect retinue: ḍākinīs, accomplished ones, bodhisattvas;
[16800] Perfect Dharma: secret mantra external-internal dharmas;
[16801] Perfect time: self-condition, karma, and fortune gathering.

[16802] Secret five perfections:
[16803] Perfect field: blazing fire charnel ground;
[16804] Perfect teacher: glorious powerful youth hero;
[16805] Perfect retinue: ḍākinīs and so forth;
[16806] Perfect Dharma:
[16807] Natural Great Perfection,
[16808] Secret unsurpassed tantra, seven essences;
[16809] Perfect time: taught when conditions are completely pure.
[16810] Thus shown: all emanation-kāya teachers possess external, internal, and secret five perfections.

[16811] The second: detailed explanation of wisdoms' fields comprises three aspects:
<list> [16812] Essence;
<list> [16813] Definitive terminology;

[16814] Essence: self-knowing nature, free from elaboration.

<tantra> [16815] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16816] "From thought-free Dharmatā self-clarity,
<tantra> [16817] Unobservable wisdom-appearance arises."
<tantra> [16818] Thus it is spoken.

[16819] Definitive terminology, from that text:
[16820] "First-arisen wisdom,
[16821] Through knowing, afflictions' flaws are purified."
<tantra> [16822] Thus it is spoken.

[16823] Divisions: three—
<list> [16824] Dharma-kāya ground-abiding wisdom;
<list> [16825] Saṃbhoga-kāya self-mark-grasping wisdom;
<list> [16826] Emanation-kāya all-pervasive wisdom.

[16827] The first: from essence, nature, and compassion three—
[16828] Essence: primordially pure wisdom, awareness empty-clarity, stainless, ultimate—Dharma-kāya, free from elaboration-extremes, twofold-pure expanse's nature,
[16829] Abiding as manifestation-basis of three-kāyas' non-duality.

[16830] Nature: spontaneous presence wisdom, depth-clear light's manifestation-basis abiding, fields and celestial palaces and light-rays and so forth appearing, fulfilling those to be trained's hopes.

[16831] All-pervasive compassion wisdom: in its own time, though elaborations completely subside, without convention of entering objects, abiding as all-knowing wisdom's manifestation-basis—without moving from great spontaneous presence of Expanse and wisdom, performing beings' two benefits without movement or effortful striving, making seeds.

<tantra> [16832] From Six Expanses:
<tantra> [16833] "Through essence primordially pure wisdom,
<tantra> [16834] Non-recognition's stain separated from awareness;
<tantra> [16835] Through nature spontaneous presence wisdom,
<tantra> [16836] Liberated from delusion's word-harm;
<tantra> [16837] Through all-pervasive compassion wisdom,
<tantra> [16838] All appears connected in single Expanse."
<tantra> [16839] Thus it is spoken.

[16840] In Dharma-kāya's emptiness aspect, if there were no ground-abiding wisdom's manifestation-basis or seed-like manifestation, above: Buddhas awakening from delusion would be severed;
[16841] Below: sentient beings revolving in delusion would be severed—
[16842] Thus those to be trained and trainers would be impossible.
[16843] Yet from ground-abiding wisdom, external manifestation appears,
[16844] And for samsara's duration, benefit for sentient beings arises from spontaneous presence compassion's depth-clear perfected knowing-family.

<tantra> [16845] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16846] "From Dharma-kāya emptiness' nature,
<tantra> [16847] Wisdom's perfected knowing aspect,
<tantra> [16848] Spontaneously appears to sentient beings;
<tantra> [16849] Without this, samsara-nirvāṇa would be severed.
<tantra> [16850] Knowing knows and is clear;
<tantra> [16851] From self-knowing self-clarity's identity,
<tantra> [16852] Spontaneous presence compassion-nature itself,
<tantra> [16853] Unceasing, without cessation."
<tantra> [16854] Thus it is spoken.

[16855] The second: saṃbhoga-kāya's five wisdoms—
[16856] Individual mark-grasping:
[16857] For Vairocana: Dharmadhātu wisdom chief,
[16858] Other four as retinue;
[16859] For Akṣobhya: mirror-like wisdom chief,
[16860] For Ratnasambhava: equality,
[16861] For Amitābha: discriminating,
[16862] For Amoghasiddhi: all-accomplishing wisdom chief,
[16863] Other four each as retinue—thus twenty-five wisdoms, and from these, immeasurable.
[16864] Summarized as five:

<tantra> [16865] From Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [16866] "Wisdom divisions thus:
<tantra> [16867] From twenty-five's essence,
<tantra> [16868] Summarized as five aspects."
<tantra> [16869] Thus it is spoken.

[16870] How they gather:

<tantra> [16871] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16872] "Saṃbhoga-kāya's mark-grasping wisdom:
<tantra> [16873] Through pure objects, mirror-like—
<tantra> [16874] Samsara-nirvāṇa reflections clear.
<tantra> [16875] Through directionlessness, equality;
<tantra> [16876] Showing faculties' objects, discriminating;
<tantra> [16877] Without effort, all-accomplishing;
<tantra> [16878] Without distinction: Dharmadhātu."
<tantra> [16879] Thus it is spoken.

[16880] These extensively explained previously; not elaborated again.

[16881] The third: emanation-kāya's two wisdoms—
[16882] Pervading all knowables,
[16883] Knowing all included in appearance as extent,
[16884] Knowing all included in emptiness as nature,
[16885] Knowing all conventional phenomena without mixture, and guiding immeasurable collections of those to be trained's faculties, dispositions, and latencies,
[16886] Knowing ultimate Dharmatā, assembling phenomena of emptiness,
[16887] Marklessness,
[16888] And luminosity.

<tantra> [16889] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16890] "Emanation-kāya's knowables:
<tantra> [16891] Through knowing nature of things,
<tantra> [16892] Knowing phenomena's pattern in itself;
<tantra> [16893] Through knowing extent,
<tantra> [16894] Knowing those to be trained's thoughts;
<tantra> [16895] Thus from compassion's manifestation manner,
<tantra> [16896] To various beings' migrations,
<tantra> [16897] Trainer-kāya too is merely that."
<tantra> [16898] Thus it is spoken.

<tantra> [16899] Those wisdoms, meaning: by gathering the three kāyas clearly within,
<tantra> [16900] In such Buddha's dharma-kāya place,
<tantra> [16901] The three wisdoms present in ground:
<tantra> [16902] Essence-wisdom: pristine,
<tantra> [16903] Self-originated wisdom,
<tantra> [16904] Compassion's wisdom aspects complete without interruption of marks—
<tantra> [16905] Through awareness-clarity's aspect, knowing arises as ground-appearance.
<tantra> [16906] In saṃbhoga-kāya place, five distinct wisdoms:
<tantra> [16907] Dharma-expanse,
<tantra> [16908] Like mirror,
<tantra> [16909] Equality,
<tantra> [16910] Individualizing,
<tantra> [16911] Accomplishing-wisdom: appearing as objects and object-holders, not as such but as self-clarity.
<tantra> [16912] In emanation-kāya time, two wisdoms:
<tantra> [16913] Like and such knowing-wisdom.
<tantra> [16914] Those two also not as actions and actors, but knowing as spontaneously accomplished.
<tantra> [16915] Thus the three wisdoms' self-nature knowing:
<tantra> [16916] For emanation-kāya, appearing as knowable object's aspects, empty-appearing duality knowing,
<tantra> [16917] Dharmic meaning's aspects and
<tantra> [16918] Dharma's peacefulness's aspects, all-knowing wisdom,
<tantra> [16919] Saṃbhoga-kāya's direct appearance, clear light wisdom's knowable aspects clearly knowing,
<tantra> [16920] All-knowing wisdom and
<tantra> [16921] Dharma-kāya's inner-clarity essence ground-abiding wisdom's appearance.
<tantra> [16922]
<tantra> [16923] In pristine expanse, self-known clearly, dwelling in pure aspect:
<tantra> [16924] From lamp's appearance,
<tantra> [16925] To perfect Buddha,
<tantra> [16926] Three wisdom-aspects:
<tantra> [16927] All-aspect knowing,
<tantra> [16928] All-knowing wisdom and
<tantra> [16929] Ground-abiding wisdom.
<tantra> [16930] Emanation-kāya's wisdom-aspects two:
<tantra> [16931] Knowing suchness,
<tantra> [16932] Knowing suchness's meanings.
<tantra> [16933] Saṃbhoga-kāya's wisdom:
<tantra> [16934] Clear light self-appearance, knowing clearly,
<tantra> [16935] Dharma-wisdom ground-abiding,
<tantra> [16936] Awareness aspect illuminating,
<tantra> [16937] Without conceptual elaboration,
<tantra> [16938] Like space, spontaneous compassion.
<tantra> [16939] Clear and knowing, awareness present,
<tantra> [16940] Without mixing aspects, abiding.
<tantra> [16941] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [16942] The third: summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities, two aspects: explaining essence and elaborating expanded nature.
<tantra> [16943] First:
<tantra> [16944] Thus, Buddha's dharma gathering all:
<tantra> [16945] Indestructible body, jewel-ornament's maṇḍala appearing with form-body's marks and signs,
<tantra> [16946] Dharma-kāya all-peaceful pristine nature,
<tantra> [16947] Speech indestructible, jewel-ornament's dharma-aspects infinite inconceivable maṇḍala,
<tantra> [16948] Mind indestructible, jewel-ornament's inconceivable non-conceptual nature,
<tantra> [16949] Direct knowing, inconceivable ocean's heart,
<tantra> [16950] Indestructible qualities: jewel-ornament,
<tantra> [16951] Ten powers,
<tantra> [16952] Four fearlessnesses,
<tantra> [16953] Great compassion,
<tantra> [16954] Remembering close placement,
<tantra> [16955] Indestructible activities: jewel-ornament, reaching world's limit, spontaneously accomplishing all beings' two purposes.
<tantra> [16956] This much, know that Buddha's dharma-aspects are complete.
<tantra> [16957] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [16958]
<tantra> [16959] Second:
<tantra> [16960] Body,
<tantra> [16961] Speech,
<tantra> [16962] Mind.
<tantra> [16963] The three aspects: activities, functions, and wisdom.
<tantra> [16964] Such qualities and activities arise.
<tantra> [16965] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [16966] Of the second, explaining expanded nature:
<tantra> [16967] Body has three: nirmāṇakāya, sambhogakāya, dharmakāya.
<tantra> [16968] Speech has three: nirmāṇakāya's speech, sambhogakāya's speech, dharmakāya's speech.
<tantra> [16969] Mind has three: nirmāṇakāya's mind, sambhogakāya's mind, dharmakāya's mind.
<tantra> [16970] Activities: from body-speech-mind arising, three thousand world-systems' activities accomplished.
<tantra> [16971] This is the completion of all aspects.
