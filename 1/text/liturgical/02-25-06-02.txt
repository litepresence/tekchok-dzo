[16770] The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities:
[16771] Body appearing to beings as appropriate, yet each's own aspect's marks and signs perfected;
[16772] Speech: well-connected sixty limbs' sound arrangement;
[16773] Mind: knowing extent of things as they are and as they appear;
[16774] Qualities: perfected knowing of powers and so forth's dharmas without remainder;
[16775] Activities: turning the wheel of five perfections' nature—external, internal, and secret Dharma-wheels.
[16776] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16777] <prose><tantra> "Emanation-kāya too: body, speech, mind,
[16778] <prose><tantra> Qualities, activities—five aspects.
[16779] <prose><tantra> Body: marks and signs, || 10 ||
[16780] <prose><tantra> Whichever body arises for those to be trained.
[16781] <prose><tantra> Speech: well-connected words,
[16782] <prose><tantra> Brahma's Expanse: six limbs.
[16783] <prose><tantra> Mind: through knower-known wisdom,
[16784] <prose><tantra> Abides intending self-other benefit.
[16785] <prose><tantra> Qualities: perfected knowing,
[16786] <prose><tantra> Activities: external, internal, secret,
[16787] <prose><tantra> Deeds completely perfected,
[16788] <prose><tantra> Abide as five perfections."
[16789] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 20 ||
[16790] These too: external five perfections:
[16791] Perfect field: Vulture Peak;
[16792] Perfect teacher: Śākyamuni;
[16793] Perfect Dharma: various vehicles;
[16794] Perfect retinue: common and uncommon;
[16795] Perfect time: hundred-year lifespan.
[16796] Internal five perfections:
[16797] Perfect field: Akaniṣṭha;
[16798] Perfect teacher: Vajradhara;
[16799] Perfect retinue: ḍākinīs, accomplished ones, bodhisattvas; || 30 ||
[16800] Perfect Dharma: secret mantra external-internal dharmas;
[16801] Perfect time: self-condition, karma, and fortune gathering.
[16802] Secret five perfections:
[16803] Perfect field: blazing fire charnel ground;
[16804] Perfect teacher: glorious powerful youth hero;
[16805] Perfect retinue: ḍākinīs and so forth;
[16806] Perfect Dharma:
[16807] Natural Great Perfection,
[16808] Secret unsurpassed tantra, seven essences;
[16809] Perfect time: taught when conditions are completely pure. || 40 ||
[16810] Thus shown: all emanation-kāya teachers possess external, internal, and secret five perfections.
[16811] The second: detailed explanation of wisdoms' fields comprises three aspects:
[16812] <list> Essence;
[16813] <list> Definitive terminology;
[16814] Essence: self-knowing nature, free from elaboration.
[16815] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16816] <prose><tantra> "From thought-free Dharmatā self-clarity,
[16817] <prose><tantra> Unobservable wisdom-appearance arises."
[16818] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16819] Definitive terminology, from that text: || 50 ||
[16820] "First-arisen wisdom,
[16821] Through knowing, afflictions' flaws are purified."
[16822] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16823] Divisions: three—
[16824] <list> Dharma-kāya ground-abiding wisdom;
[16825] <list> Saṃbhoga-kāya self-mark-grasping wisdom;
[16826] <list> Emanation-kāya all-pervasive wisdom.
[16827] The first: from essence, nature, and compassion three—
[16828] Essence: primordially pure wisdom, awareness empty-clarity, stainless, ultimate—Dharma-kāya, free from elaboration-extremes, twofold-pure expanse's nature,
[16829] Abiding as manifestation-basis of three-kāyas' non-duality. || 60 ||
[16830] Nature: spontaneous presence wisdom, depth-clear light's manifestation-basis abiding, fields and celestial palaces and light-rays and so forth appearing, fulfilling those to be trained's hopes.
[16831] All-pervasive compassion wisdom: in its own time, though elaborations completely subside, without convention of entering objects, abiding as all-knowing wisdom's manifestation-basis—without moving from great spontaneous presence of Expanse and wisdom, performing beings' two benefits without movement or effortful striving, making seeds.
[16832] <prose><tantra> From Six Expanses:
[16833] <prose><tantra> "Through essence primordially pure wisdom,
[16834] <prose><tantra> Non-recognition's stain separated from awareness;
[16835] <prose><tantra> Through nature spontaneous presence wisdom,
[16836] <prose><tantra> Liberated from delusion's word-harm;
[16837] <prose><tantra> Through all-pervasive compassion wisdom,
[16838] <prose><tantra> All appears connected in single Expanse."
[16839] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 70 ||
[16840] In Dharma-kāya's emptiness aspect, if there were no ground-abiding wisdom's manifestation-basis or seed-like manifestation, above: Buddhas awakening from delusion would be severed;
[16841] Below: sentient beings revolving in delusion would be severed—
[16842] Thus those to be trained and trainers would be impossible.
[16843] Yet from ground-abiding wisdom, external manifestation appears,
[16844] And for samsara's duration, benefit for sentient beings arises from spontaneous presence compassion's depth-clear perfected knowing-family.
[16845] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16846] <prose><tantra> "From Dharma-kāya emptiness' nature,
[16847] <prose><tantra> Wisdom's perfected knowing aspect,
[16848] <prose><tantra> Spontaneously appears to sentient beings;
[16849] <prose><tantra> Without this, samsara-nirvāṇa would be severed. || 80 ||
[16850] <prose><tantra> Knowing knows and is clear;
[16851] <prose><tantra> From self-knowing self-clarity's identity,
[16852] <prose><tantra> Spontaneous presence compassion-nature itself,
[16853] <prose><tantra> Unceasing, without cessation."
[16854] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16855] The second: saṃbhoga-kāya's five wisdoms—
[16856] Individual mark-grasping:
[16857] For Vairocana: Dharmadhātu wisdom chief,
[16858] Other four as retinue;
[16859] For Akṣobhya: mirror-like wisdom chief, || 90 ||
[16860] For Ratnasambhava: equality,
[16861] For Amitābha: discriminating,
[16862] For Amoghasiddhi: all-accomplishing wisdom chief,
[16863] Other four each as retinue—thus twenty-five wisdoms, and from these, immeasurable.
[16864] Summarized as five:
[16865] <prose><tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[16866] <prose><tantra> "Wisdom divisions thus:
[16867] <prose><tantra> From twenty-five's essence,
[16868] <prose><tantra> Summarized as five aspects."
[16869] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 100 ||
[16870] How they gather:
[16871] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16872] <prose><tantra> "Saṃbhoga-kāya's mark-grasping wisdom:
[16873] <prose><tantra> Through pure objects, mirror-like—
[16874] <prose><tantra> Samsara-nirvāṇa reflections clear.
[16875] <prose><tantra> Through directionlessness, equality;
[16876] <prose><tantra> Showing faculties' objects, discriminating;
[16877] <prose><tantra> Without effort, all-accomplishing;
[16878] <prose><tantra> Without distinction: Dharmadhātu."
[16879] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 110 ||
[16880] These extensively explained previously; not elaborated again.
[16881] The third: emanation-kāya's two wisdoms—
[16882] Pervading all knowables,
[16883] Knowing all included in appearance as extent,
[16884] Knowing all included in emptiness as nature,
[16885] Knowing all conventional phenomena without mixture, and guiding immeasurable collections of those to be trained's faculties, dispositions, and latencies,
[16886] Knowing ultimate Dharmatā, assembling phenomena of emptiness,
[16887] Marklessness,
[16888] And luminosity.
[16889] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur: || 120 ||
[16890] <prose><tantra> "Emanation-kāya's knowables:
[16891] <prose><tantra> Through knowing nature of things,
[16892] <prose><tantra> Knowing phenomena's pattern in itself;
[16893] <prose><tantra> Through knowing extent,
[16894] <prose><tantra> Knowing those to be trained's thoughts;
[16895] <prose><tantra> Thus from compassion's manifestation manner,
[16896] <prose><tantra> To various beings' migrations,
[16897] <prose><tantra> Trainer-kāya too is merely that."
[16898] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16899] <prose><tantra> Those wisdoms, meaning: by gathering the three kāyas clearly within, || 130 ||
[16900] <prose><tantra> In such Buddha's dharma-kāya place,
[16901] <prose><tantra> The three wisdoms present in ground:
[16902] <prose><tantra> Essence-wisdom: pristine,
[16903] <prose><tantra> Self-originated wisdom,
[16904] <prose><tantra> Compassion's wisdom aspects complete without interruption of marks—
[16905] <prose><tantra> Through awareness-clarity's aspect, knowing arises as ground-appearance.
[16906] <prose><tantra> In saṃbhoga-kāya place, five distinct wisdoms:
[16907] <prose><tantra> Dharma-expanse,
[16908] <prose><tantra> Like mirror,
[16909] <prose><tantra> Equality, || 140 ||
[16910] <prose><tantra> Individualizing,
[16911] <prose><tantra> Accomplishing-wisdom: appearing as objects and object-holders, not as such but as self-clarity.
[16912] <prose><tantra> In emanation-kāya time, two wisdoms:
[16913] <prose><tantra> Like and such knowing-wisdom.
[16914] <prose><tantra> Those two also not as actions and actors, but knowing as spontaneously accomplished.
[16915] <prose><tantra> Thus the three wisdoms' self-nature knowing:
[16916] <prose><tantra> For emanation-kāya, appearing as knowable object's aspects, empty-appearing duality knowing,
[16917] <prose><tantra> Dharmic meaning's aspects and
[16918] <prose><tantra> Dharma's peacefulness's aspects, all-knowing wisdom,
[16919] <prose><tantra> Saṃbhoga-kāya's direct appearance, clear light wisdom's knowable aspects clearly knowing, || 150 ||
[16920] <prose><tantra> All-knowing wisdom and
[16921] <prose><tantra> Dharma-kāya's inner-clarity essence ground-abiding wisdom's appearance.
[16922] <prose><tantra>
[16923] <prose><tantra> In pristine expanse, self-known clearly, dwelling in pure aspect:
[16924] <prose><tantra> From lamp's appearance,
[16925] <prose><tantra> To perfect Buddha,
[16926] <prose><tantra> Three wisdom-aspects:
[16927] <prose><tantra> All-aspect knowing,
[16928] <prose><tantra> All-knowing wisdom and
[16929] <prose><tantra> Ground-abiding wisdom. || 160 ||
[16930] <prose><tantra> Emanation-kāya's wisdom-aspects two:
[16931] <prose><tantra> Knowing suchness,
[16932] <prose><tantra> Knowing suchness's meanings.
[16933] <prose><tantra> Saṃbhoga-kāya's wisdom:
[16934] <prose><tantra> Clear light self-appearance, knowing clearly,
[16935] <prose><tantra> Dharma-wisdom ground-abiding,
[16936] <prose><tantra> Awareness aspect illuminating,
[16937] <prose><tantra> Without conceptual elaboration,
[16938] <prose><tantra> Like space, spontaneous compassion.
[16939] <prose><tantra> Clear and knowing, awareness present, || 170 ||
[16940] <prose><tantra> Without mixing aspects, abiding.
[16941] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16942] <prose><tantra> The third: summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities, two aspects: explaining essence and elaborating expanded nature.
[16943] <prose><tantra> First:
[16944] <prose><tantra> Thus, Buddha's dharma gathering all:
[16945] <prose><tantra> Indestructible body, jewel-ornament's maṇḍala appearing with form-body's marks and signs,
[16946] <prose><tantra> Dharma-kāya all-peaceful pristine nature,
[16947] <prose><tantra> Speech indestructible, jewel-ornament's dharma-aspects infinite inconceivable maṇḍala,
[16948] <prose><tantra> Mind indestructible, jewel-ornament's inconceivable non-conceptual nature,
[16949] <prose><tantra> Direct knowing, inconceivable ocean's heart, || 180 ||
[16950] <prose><tantra> Indestructible qualities: jewel-ornament,
[16951] <prose><tantra> Ten powers,
[16952] <prose><tantra> Four fearlessnesses,
[16953] <prose><tantra> Great compassion,
[16954] <prose><tantra> Remembering close placement,
[16955] <prose><tantra> Indestructible activities: jewel-ornament, reaching world's limit, spontaneously accomplishing all beings' two purposes.
[16956] <prose><tantra> This much, know that Buddha's dharma-aspects are complete.
[16957] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16958] <prose><tantra>
[16959] <prose><tantra> Second: || 190 ||
[16960] <prose><tantra> Body,
[16961] <prose><tantra> Speech,
[16962] <prose><tantra> Mind.
[16963] <prose><tantra> The three aspects: activities, functions, and wisdom.
[16964] <prose><tantra> Such qualities and activities arise.
[16965] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16966] <prose><tantra> Of the second, explaining expanded nature:
[16967] <prose><tantra> Body has three: nirmāṇakāya, sambhogakāya, dharmakāya.
[16968] <prose><tantra> Speech has three: nirmāṇakāya's speech, sambhogakāya's speech, dharmakāya's speech.
[16969] <prose><tantra> Mind has three: nirmāṇakāya's mind, sambhogakāya's mind, dharmakāya's mind. || 200 ||
[16970] <prose><tantra> Activities: from body-speech-mind arising, three thousand world-systems' activities accomplished.
[16971] <prose><tantra> This is the completion of all aspects.
