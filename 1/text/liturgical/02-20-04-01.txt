[8972] At first losing, the two awarenesses of delusion-time have no good-bad distinction.
[8973] Awareness not meditated and
[8974] At time of meditating, without distinction,
[8975] At time of wandering and
[8976] At time of passing, awareness has no good-bad.
[8977] At time of going to sleep and
[8978] At time of waking and
[8979] At time of going-coming, awareness has no good-bad distinction, like thus.
[8980] However, there is only dream joy-suffering of good-bad appearance manner;
[8981] Depending on that, one meditates the path.
[8982] It is not hope that essence goes to good,
[8983] For awareness has no transfer-change.
[8984] Thus also from Self-Arising:
[8985] E ma ho!
[8986] This precious jewel nectar,
[8987] At the time of beginningless time,
[8988] I lost the precious jewel.
[8989] At that time, wandering wrongly in suffering.
[8990] That precious jewel nectar,
[8991] Has no place to find by searching.
[8992] Self-arisen from self, realized by self.
[8993] That precious jewel nectar,
[8994] Not feeling loss, feeling finding.
[8995] By losing, things without characteristics;
[8996] Possessing joy's glow by finding.
[8997] Time of finding and time of losing,
[8998] Realized in one state without distinction.
[8999] Thus it is spoken.
[9000] Moreover, that losing in self-awareness's state, though finding from self's state,
[9001] From self-awareness's one wheel,

[9002] Does not enter elsewhere.
[9003] Losing jewel in king's treasury, doing suffering by jewel's absence.
[9004] Though joy-bliss expands by finding from treasury, both do not move from one treasury, like thus.
[9005] Samsara-nirvana two appearing from awareness's state is also thus.
[9006] This is the secret word of determining the self-essential-point of supreme wish-fulfillment, realizing vast Dharma-nature's expanse.
[9007] Second, demonstrating lamp-experience from that has three aspects:
[9008] Preliminary characteristics of place,
[9009] Actual lamp-pressing method,
[9010] From that, manner of appearance-arising.
[9011] First:
[9012] Abandoning all actions of this life,
[9013] Making the holy lama pleased,
[9014] Sitting with three immovables in a room decorated by darkness in a very secluded place,
[9015] Perfecting lama-yoga, meditating, placing request from heart.
[9016] From Thalgyur:
[9017] Lamp-pressing is thus:
[9018] By faithful one, mind-free from samsara,
[9019] Do lama-offering and giving,
[9020] Abandoning all samsara connections,
[9021] In secluded direction or charnel-ground,
[9022] One must abide alone, abandoning companions.
