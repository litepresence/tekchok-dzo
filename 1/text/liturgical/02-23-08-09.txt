[14753] Fifth: liberation through primordial purity.
[14754] In the interval between having been liberated but not yet dissolved, emanations are displayed.
[14755] The day of emanation is equivalent to one day of meditative concentration.
[14756] Correlating the five instants with each day of meditative concentration, the manner of liberation through appearances is taught.

<verse> [14758] Some are liberated into the Expanse of the Five Lights;
<verse> [14759] Some are liberated into the Expanse of the Five Bodies;

<verse> [14762] Some are liberated into the Expanse of the Periphery;
<verse> [14763] Some are liberated through the upper and lower spheres;

[14773] Moreover, from one's own heart-center, a single Body emerges,
[14774] From which Bodies without number emanate.
[14775] Through awakening to this, one's awareness becomes empowered, like a shooting star.

[14785] The supreme among medium faculties:
[14786] Requires nine days,

[14804] Then, attaining definitive realization, seeing all appearances as a mansion of light, certainty is attained.
[14805] Emanation is able to accomplish benefit on the thirty-fourth day.
[14806] The intermediate medium:
