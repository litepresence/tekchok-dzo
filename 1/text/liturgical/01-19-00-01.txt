<tantra> [5963] Spread upon the tongue of faculties without desire,
<tantra> [5964] Shown as Dharmas of numbered vehicles.
<tantra> [5965] Thus by the excellent explanation of Three Kayas and speech,
<tantra> [5966] The minds of sentient beings, Bodhisattvas, and
<tantra> [5967] All Buddhas are satisfied;
<tantra> [5968] Thus the hopes of beings are fulfilled.
<tantra> [5969] Thus it is spoken.
[5970] Thus, when the meaning and purpose of the two prologues shown are arranged:
[5971] "Thus at one time I taught" means
[5972] Vajrapāṇi, having promised "I shall teach the retinue completely what I heard from glorious Samantabhadra before," or
[5973] Vajrapāṇi himself, accepting to be the teacher of the tantra, taught to the retinue saying "I taught."
<tantra> [5974] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [5975] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue.
<tantra> [5976] Thus it is spoken.
[5977] That also, Vajradhara is Buddha;
<tantra> [5978] From the Śrīparamādi:
<tantra> [5979] Buddha before all Buddhas,
<tantra> [5980] Vajradhara, king, vajra-mind.
<tantra> [5981] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [5982] From the Training Tantra:
<tantra> [5983] Buddha before all Buddhas,
<tantra> [5984] Destroyer of all ignorance's stains.
<tantra> [5985] Vajra, Vajra-holder, king,
<tantra> [5986] Vajra, Vajra, Vajra-holder,
<tantra> [5987] Vajrapāṇi, Mahāmudrā.
<tantra> [5988] Thus it is spoken.
[5989] "Thus at one time I heard" means: Vajrapāṇi, at the time when I actually heard before from teacher Samantabhadra, great Vajradhara—
[5990] Thinking that the compiler's Dharma was awakened into by former victors having accepted it into heart,
[5991] And the lineage unbroken in the middle,
[5992] And the meaning of the three times' Dharma enumerations harmonious,
[5993] Is shown in order to generate faith in the retinue.
<tantra> [5994] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [5995] In order to accord with the door of other vehicles,
<tantra> [5996] By means of the common prologue,
<tantra> [5997] To the compiler's own retinue,
<tantra> [5998] In order to make faith,
<tantra> [5999] It is shown—from the disciple as the basis,
<tantra> [6000] By making taming,
<tantra> [6001] Arisen, makes the teaching abide.
<tantra> [6002] Thus it is spoken.
[6003] Third: abandoning refutations of wrong understanding:
[6004] Some, having no opportunity to view the form of the vast ocean of Dharma with the closed eye of intellect, say:
[6005] "In other sūtras and tantras, 'Thus have I heard' is spoken,
[6006] 'Taught' does not arise here, so it is fabricated."
[6007] If "taught" becomes fabricated,
<tantra> [6008] From the Cakrasamvara Root Tantra:
<tantra> [6009] "Then the secret must be taught,"
<tantra> [6010] Thus it is spoken;
[6011] That also has the fault of falling into fabrication.
[6012] Moreover, if saying that showing twice is not valid,
[6013] It follows that the entirety of the melodious-expressed section is not valid;
[6014] For the purpose of showing, after one prose, one verse is repeated,
[6015] And showing the name twice also follows as not valid.
[6016] Therefore, showing the arising of the meaning-tantra is the uncommon prologue;
[6017] Showing the arising of the word-tantra, indicating, is the common prologue—
[6018] Upon the non-contradictory, again very connected, it is shown.
[6019] By these, the definitive meaning of the prologue is shown.
[6020] Knowing this much, in order to know the structure and understood meaning of the tantras, it is arranged and established here in this context.
[6021] Third meaning: the prophecy of the sacred definitive teaching—
[6022] The teaching of Vajra-essence,
[6023] The seed-kāya of the teaching,
[6024] The self-arisen letter,
[6025] The three vajras,
[6026] The sequence of persons holding these, arising before and after—
[6027] Showing these three meanings: the manner of the teaching's descent generally shown,
[6028] Its flourishing and decline explained in particular,
[6029] The persons who hold it shown.
[6030] First:
[6031] At the time of the arrangement of the great Brahma aeon by primordial Samantabhadra,
[6032] From that blessing, the Buddha-emanation Vajradhara arose from Dharmakāya to Saṃbhogakāya;
[6033] At the time of the kāyas such as Vairocana, arranging the great Brahma aeon,
[6034] Acting for the benefit of disciples through various emanation-kāyas—
[6035] At the beginning of that aeon, the actual teaching of Great Perfection to Dharmakāya,
[6036] The teaching-sound of Saṃbhogakāya self-sounding,
[6037] Acting for benefit through the manifestation-appearance of emanation-kāya,
[6038] And the vajra arisen from that blessing,
[6039] The texts,
[6040] The kāya images gradually descended,
[6041] Holding the actual and reflected teaching—
[6042] The spontaneous arising of benefit for sentient beings from Buddha:
[6043] From the aeon of the first emanation's awakening,
[6044] Before this field was formed at that time, going as emanation to other fields and acting for benefit,
[6045] Now acting for benefit through the appearance of a thousand Buddhas in this Saha field—these are the blessings of the three.
<tantra> [6046] From the Sound Thalgyur:
<tantra> [6047] The seventeen definitive secret commands,
<tantra> [6048] Together with the teaching's light-arrow and miraculous letter,
<tantra> [6049] At the beginning of the emanation-kāya's field,
<tantra> [6050] Teacher Samantabhadra,
<tantra> [6051] Held in the place of dense array.
<tantra> [6052] Then in the abode of Tuṣita,
<tantra> [6053] Rigpa-Vairocana,
<tantra> [6054] Holding this, ripened the five rigpas.
<tantra> [6055] Past that, held by me,
<tantra> [6056] The sacred life-tree of the teaching—
<tantra> [6057] A thousand Buddhas and two roots,
<tantra> [6058] Relying upon this, definitively arise.
<tantra> [6059] Miraculous and egg-born,
<tantra> [6060] Warmth and womb-born,
<tantra> [6061] Ripen sentient beings.
<tantra> [6062] From this very teaching of disciples,
<tantra> [6063] Twelve Dharma wheels arose.
<tantra> [6064] By this, thirty-six deeds
<tantra> [6065] Relying upon the Three Kayas,
<tantra> [6066] Appear to sentient beings, objects of disciples.
<tantra> [6067] Thus it is spoken.
[6068] If these manners are extensively shown:
[6069] After Vajradhara, having arranged the great Brahma aeon, passed through numberless, inconceivable aeons,
[6070] At the beginning of this field's formation,
[6071] From here, in the northern direction, in the field called "Moving-Possessing,"
[6072] Those three seeds of the teaching abide.
[6073] In that field, through the individual karma of sentient beings,
[6074] The seven times of arising of these,
[6075] The seven times of non-arising—fourteen—became flourishing and decline.
[6076] From that, the seven times of arising are:
<list> [6077] Endowment,
<list> [6078] Perfection,
<list> [6079] Great Perfection,
<list> [6080] Two-Possessing,
<list> [6081] Three-Possessing,
<list> [6082] Strife-Possessing,
<list> [6083] Great Strife-Possessing.
[6084] Between each of those, declining, are called the seven dark aeons.
[6085] Then, the vessel and environment of this field formed; at the first aeon, in Tuṣita stacked,
[6086] The teacher came;
[6087] Those three seeds descended here,
[6088] Made to flourish and decline by the seven sequences,
[6089] Finally leaping to another.
<tantra> [6090] From the Sound Thalgyur:
<tantra> [6091] Thus to this very teaching,
<tantra> [6092] The remaining teaching thus,
<tantra> [6093] Explained as definitively great by time.
<tantra> [6094] Endowment and Perfection,
<tantra> [6095] Perfections, the great,
<tantra> [6096] Thus Two-Possessing and Three-Possessing,
<tantra> [6097] Strife-Possessing and Great Strife,
<tantra> [6098] Between each of those,
<tantra> [6099] In sixty dark aeons,
<tantra> [6100] The teaching's seed becomes other.
<tantra> [6101] The northern direction, Moving-Possessing,
<tantra> [6102] The teaching's lamp abides there,
<tantra> [6103] Called "Glorious Protector,"
<tantra> [6104] Monks will hold.
<tantra> [6105] That patron, the king,
<tantra> [6106] Called Jinamitra,
<tantra> [6107] Makes the secret basis of the teaching.
<tantra> [6108] Abides for one thousand three hundred years.
<tantra> [6109] Then the dark aeon
<tantra> [6110] Abides between sixty.
<tantra> [6111] Then the southern direction, Sthalaskandha,
<tantra> [6112] In the wide and beautiful continent,
<tantra> [6113] The teaching's life-tree descended there,
<tantra> [6114] Called "Joy-Glorious,"
<tantra> [6115] By the Tuṣita family gathering,
<tantra> [6116] This teaching will be held.
<tantra> [6117] That patron, householder family,
<tantra> [6118] Called "Virtue-Accomplishment,"
<tantra> [6119] Makes to abide for a hundred years.
<tantra> [6120] Then becomes the dark aeon,
<tantra> [6121] Becomes one hundred twenty years.
<tantra> [6122] Then the eastern direction, Bliss River,
<tantra> [6123] At the peak of Vajra-Arising Mountain,
<tantra> [6124] This sacred teaching descended,
<tantra> [6125] Called "Sūtra Collection,"
<tantra> [6126] The king himself holds the teaching.
<tantra> [6127] That patron, the brahmin,
<tantra> [6128] Called Jayākara,
<tantra> [6129] Abides for one thousand four hundred years.
<tantra> [6130] After that, the dark aeon
<tantra> [6131] Becomes five thousand years.
<tantra> [6132] Then the western direction, Affection Continent,
<tantra> [6133] Called Bhatisali,
<tantra> [6134] Also to the good family of beings,
<tantra> [6135] Again the three essences descended,
<tantra> [6136] Also by the monk Bliss-Protector,
<tantra> [6137] This sacred teaching held,
<tantra> [6138] That patron, the hero
<tantra> [6139] By outcaste family for a thousand years,
<tantra> [6140] Made this abiding and flourishing.
<tantra> [6141] After that passed, darkness below,
<tantra> [6142] Abides for five thousand years.
<tantra> [6143] Then again descended here,
<tantra> [6144] To the place called Vajra Seat,
<tantra> [6145] This flourishing, light blazing,
<tantra> [6146] For five hundred fifty years.
<tantra> [6147] This is held by Lodrö Zangpo;
<tantra> [6148] That patron, a Ḍākinī,
<tantra> [6149] Made cool and pure.
<tantra> [6150] After that, this world,
<tantra> [6151] Earth, water, fire, and wind clash and disturb,
<tantra> [6152] Becomes the non-abiding great emptiness.
<tantra> [6153] From the first called aeon,
<tantra> [6154] The time of final destruction arises.
<tantra> [6155] Thus it is spoken.
[6156] Lodrö Zangpo is all who hold this;
[6157] Five hundred years is a great year,
[6158] Passed in five hundreds.
[6159] That much appearing to humans from the first aeon to this interval of ten years of life, the primordial—
[6160] Others, not, do benefit in the abode of Ḍākinīs.
[6161] Second, the particular explanation of flourishing and decline:
[6162] In this Jambudvīpa, now, until the primordial, the seven types of flourishing and decline arising in this interval of ten years of life are:
<tantra> [6163] From the Great Arrangement of Ati:
<tantra> [6164] Listen, fortunate Śāriputra,
<tantra> [6165] The sacred teaching's vast, great arrangement,
<tantra> [6166] The supreme essence repeatedly gathered,
<tantra> [6167] This gold-essence sun-illuminator,
<tantra> [6168] Does not flourish mixed with the common,
<tantra> [6169] Appears to some possessing the great secret family.
<tantra> [6170] In the time of degenerate strife-possessing, coarse affliction,
<tantra> [6171] Factions, internal quarrels, all hermitages destroyed.
<tantra> [6172] Royal law not abiding, self-pride, kingly conduct of desire,
<tantra> [6173] Father and son quarrel, weapons protect bodies.
<tantra> [6174] Accumulated groups lost, earth's essences exhausted,
<tantra> [6175] Unsuitable views and conduct also many arise.
<tantra> [6176] Five hundred degenerations, life years gradually decline,
<tantra> [6177] Life of sixty years, little merit and fortune,
<tantra> [6178] This essence abides for sixty years.
<tantra> [6179] After that passed, in the interval of a hundred years,
<tantra> [6180] This secret not abiding, conduct of reasoning.
<tantra> [6181] After that passed, even in a thousand years,
<tantra> [6182] From the person without study and contemplation,
<tantra> [6183] This supreme secret becomes like the sun.
<tantra> [6184] After that passed, becomes darkness for two hundred.
<tantra> [6185] Then, when life years are forty,
<tantra> [6186] This essence abides for the interval of a hundred years.
<tantra> [6187] After that passed, becomes darkness for thirty.
<tantra> [6188] After that passed, abiding for the interval of a hundred years,
<tantra> [6189] When beings' life is thirty years,
<tantra> [6190] This supreme secret declines, flourishes for eight hundred years of distant benefit,
<tantra> [6191] This not arising when life is twenty.
<tantra> [6192] When life is ten years, this essence arises;
<tantra> [6193] Whoever meets this, arising self-dissolves.
<tantra> [6194] The teaching's seed dissolved in sky, not appearing to people,
<tantra> [6195] Again, the teaching's ember becomes other.
<tantra> [6196] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [6197] From the Sound Thalgyur:
<tantra> [6198] The near cause of destroying the teaching—
<tantra> [6199] In those individual abodes,
<tantra> [6200] Called "person possessing wrong desire,"
<tantra> [6201] Each, by all teaching,
<tantra> [6202] Is the near cause of destroying.
<tantra> [6203] This, at the first time of darkness,
<tantra> [6204] In the west of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6205] A king with six fingers on the hand,
<tantra> [6206] Having blue extra teeth in front,
<tantra> [6207] On the right hand's wrist,
<tantra> [6208] A black mole, shape of sin,
<tantra> [6209] Possessing great terror—
<tantra> [6210] The Buddha's teaching becomes darkness.
<tantra> [6211] Becomes for the interval of sixty years.
<tantra> [6212] Then, first held by Palden;
<tantra> [6213] After passing one thousand three hundred,
<tantra> [6214] Again, in the north of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6215] At the root of the radiant mountain,
<tantra> [6216] An ascetic's form without loving mind,
<tantra> [6217] Two ears on the right,
<tantra> [6218] Eyes with three corners, eyelids covering upward.
<tantra> [6219] This, quarreling with tīrthika factions,
<tantra> [6220] Darkness for sixty years.
<tantra> [6221] After that, called Deva of Bliss,
<tantra> [6222] Makes flourishing for the interval of a hundred years.
<tantra> [6223] After that passed, in the northeast of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6224] At the root where the great river Rab-me flows,
<tantra> [6225] A king's body possessing merit,
<tantra> [6226] Not having even one eye,
<tantra> [6227] Coarse limbs, powerful body,
<tantra> [6228] Adorned with archery and craft.
<tantra> [6229] By this, suppressing the Dharma-doer,
<tantra> [6230] The teaching for sixty years.
<tantra> [6231] Here, from the west, becomes other.
<tantra> [6232] After that passed, in Pratyekabuddha form,
<tantra> [6233] Arising from Vajra Seat to the west.
<tantra> [6234] By that, the sacred teaching
<tantra> [6235] Abides for one hundred twenty years.
<tantra> [6236] After that passed, below, in the center of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6237] In the place called Golden City,
<tantra> [6238] An elder's body with two tongue-tips,
<tantra> [6239] Small hump, short limbs,
<tantra> [6240] Factions quarreling, holding weapons.
<tantra> [6241] By this arising, also darkness,
<tantra> [6242] For the interval of sixty years.
<tantra> [6243] After that passed, below, in the east of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6244] The rivers Lokita,
<tantra> [6245] On the right-direction banks,
<tantra> [6246] Called Glorious Lion,
<tantra> [6247] Abides for one thousand four hundred years.
<tantra> [6248] Then again, in the center of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6249] On the bank of the great river Gaṅgā,
<tantra> [6250] A king's son, shoulder
<tantra> [6251] Similar to the color of down,
<tantra> [6252] Ordained, four fingers measure.
<tantra> [6253] By this arising, also darkness,
<tantra> [6254] For the interval of sixty years.
<tantra> [6255] After that passed, below, in Kāmarūpa,
<tantra> [6256] The monastery called Śīla,
<tantra> [6257] That master, protector of youth,
<tantra> [6258] By this, abides for the interval of a thousand.
<tantra> [6259] After that, in the south of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6260] The town called Brahma's Island,
<tantra> [6261] To a common family, lion head
<tantra> [6262] This, three months after birth,
<tantra> [6263] Becomes darkness for the interval of sixty.
<tantra> [6264] After that, at Vulture Peak,
<tantra> [6265] By the monk Śobhya-youth,
<tantra> [6266] Abides for five hundred fifty years.
<tantra> [6267] After that passed, below, at the border of Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6268] In the land called Kāśmīra,
<tantra> [6269] In the sound-possessing city,
<tantra> [6270] Bird body, human face,
<tantra> [6271] Born among low-caste families.
<tantra> [6272] This, ten years after birth,
<tantra> [6273] Becomes darkness for sixty.
<tantra> [6274] After that passed, below, in Jambudvīpa,
<tantra> [6275] In the center, five yojanas to the east,
<tantra> [6276] By the monk Śākya Jīka,
<tantra> [6277] This, for the interval of ten years,
<tantra> [6278] Becomes like a blazing lamp.
<tantra> [6279] Thus by the seven sequences,
<tantra> [6280] Flourishing and decline are made in Jambudvīpa.
<tantra> [6281] Thus it is spoken.
[6282] Thus, the seven complete flourishing and declining, after life of ten years, below, up to here, the three seeds of the teaching do not abide in this field;
[6283] From here, descended to the field of beautiful arrangement in the southern direction, at the time of the completion of that field's deeds by the seven flourishing and declining,
[6284] The time of Saha's emptiness;
[6285] Again, those three leap to the vast protector world of the northern direction,
[6286] After the Buddha Beautiful-Utpala-Flower held and did the seven flourishing and declining,
[6287] Leap to the world called "Vast Sound Topknot" in the western direction,
[6288] After the Buddha Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra held and abided for seven hundred-thousand years in the manner of seven flourishing and declining,
[6289] All beings of all fields existing in the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, along with that field, are liberated in the primordial ground;
[6290] The great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara, with vessel and environment, becomes empty,
[6291] Abides for eighty-five aeons as one sky.
[6292] The three seeds of the teaching:
[6293] By Vajradhara's great deeds completed,
[6294] Dissolve themselves in the peaceful sphere of dharmatā, not appearing to people.
[6295] Then again, beings appearing from the sphere, and by emanation, arrange the great Brahma—
[6296] At the time when the teacher of taming-making came to the appearance of disciples for six hundred-thousand aeons,
[6297] From Samantabhadra's blessing,
[6298] The three seeds of the teaching self-arose, explained as arising for the benefit of sentient beings without flourishing and decline.
<tantra> [6299] From the Sound Thalgyur:
<tantra> [6300] Then from the beautiful arrangement,
<tantra> [6301] Leaped to those fields,
<tantra> [6302] After life years of ten,
<tantra> [6303] Here not abiding, appearing there.
<tantra> [6304] Thus from completed flourishing and decline,
<tantra> [6305] This essence of the sacred teaching,
<tantra> [6306] In the vast protector world,
<tantra> [6307] Making the Buddha's teaching abide—
<tantra> [6308] Called Beautiful-Utpala-Flower,
<tantra> [6309] Teacher Buddha, Bhagavān,
<tantra> [6310] In the palace of Sukhāvati's stacked,
<tantra> [6311] With an assembly of five thousand,
<tantra> [6312] All great Bodhisattvas,
<tantra> [6313] Having obtained patience in the unborn Dharma,
<tantra> [6314] Only those possessing virtuous mind arise.
<tantra> [6315] That very teacher came,
<tantra> [6316] Tamed those possessing wrong desire,
<tantra> [6317] This very sacred teaching
<tantra> [6318] For five thousand thousand years
<tantra> [6319] Makes the essence of the teaching abide.
<tantra> [6320] Then again, like the former,
<tantra> [6321] Makes flourishing and decline by seven sequences.
<tantra> [6322] After that, Tuṣita possessing sound,
<tantra> [6323] In the vast world-realm,
<tantra> [6324] Teacher Amitāyus, Destroyer-of-Saṃsāra,
<tantra> [6325] Retinue of one hundred eight and a half,
<tantra> [6326] All arhats with outflows exhausted,
<tantra> [6327] Deed done, burden cast off.
<tantra> [6328] By that also, the essence of the teaching
<tantra> [6329] Abides for seven hundred-thousand years.
<tantra> [6330] By the sequence of former force,
<tantra> [6331] Thus, from the passing of seven abidings,
<tantra> [6332] Also for eighty-five aeons,
<tantra> [6333] Dharmas dissolved into Buddha-kāya,
<tantra> [6334] In whatever world-realm,
<tantra> [6335] The Buddha's teaching does not abide.
<tantra> [6336] Then to the lower world,
<tantra> [6337] For six hundred-thousand aeons,
<tantra> [6338] The Buddha's teaching abides long;
<tantra> [6339] In this, flourishing and decline do not arise,
<tantra> [6340] Ripens beings.
<tantra> [6341] Thus it is spoken.
[6342] That also, to the Buddha's teaching, actual and
[6343] From the two reflections:
[6344] Reflection is:
[6345] Pervading wherever in the six realms, from beings' aspiration and teacher's blessing.
[6346] From the three actual teachings:
[6347] The two teachings of Dharmakāya and Saṃbhogakāya—teacher's self-appearance, pure sphere,
[6348] The palace of dharmadhātu, and
[6349] The two dense arrays of clear light,
[6350] Existing as the permanent, continuous wheel;
[6351] The common teaching of emanation-kāya, the sequence of sūtra and tantra, and
[6352] The two uncommon, great secret, definitive supreme vehicles—
[6353] Do not exist other than the realms of gods and humans possessing particular merit,
[6354] For Ḍākinīs also exist in the realms of gods and humans.
[6355] In this great secret definitive teaching, for those meeting the three actual seeds of the teaching, liberation without effort is doubtless.
[6356] From the letter of speech-emanation,
[6357] Written in harmony with the body-color of whatever teaching the Buddha came to,
[6358] Placed in a jewel casket, carried in the left armpit, reading from time to time, and
[6359] Making veneration and worship, liberation is also without effort—
[6360] Also in this life, long life,
[6361] Without disease,
[6362] All wishes accomplished,
[6363] Opportunity not found by demons and obstacles that lead astray,
[6364] Making the end of life blissful, without the suffering of severing illness at the time of death, and
[6365] For those seeing the door of introduction here, if so, seizing firm ground in the wisdom-lamp of the intermediate state, and
[6366] Even being of the vehicle holding mental analysis,
[6367] Birth in the pure field, and
[6368] Even ordinary, meeting this great secret, liberation, etc.—immeasurable qualities exist as the support for birth in the higher blissful realm.
<tantra> [6369] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [6370] Making the sun very illuminating,
<tantra> [6371] The three things of body, speech, and mind—
<tantra> [6372] To whoever descended, without effort,
<tantra> [6373] Definitely obtains Buddhahood.
[6374] Therefore the key point of blessing:
[6375] Also from the very speech-emanation,
[6376] Written with the teaching's color,
[6377] Placed in the left armpit,
[6378] If read and held in time,
[6379] Complete awakening is certain without doubt.
[6380] Also if this tantra is constantly read,
[6381] By that also, becomes like the above.
<tantra> [6382] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [6383] From the Great Arrangement:
<tantra> [6384] This, by whoever is held, is good—
<tantra> [6385] All craft and art,
<tantra> [6386] All treatises and sounds,
<tantra> [6387] Become known as wished.
<tantra> [6388] This unsurpassed supreme secret,
<tantra> [6389] If worship, praise, and honor are made,
<tantra> [6390] Supreme and common accomplishments
<tantra> [6391] Arise as wished.
<tantra> [6392] By merely carrying this,
<tantra> [6393] Scripture and oral instructions are held.
<tantra> [6394] The jewel-light dispelling the world's darkness,
<tantra> [6395] This lamp making appear—
<tantra> [6396] To whoever it appears,
<tantra> [6397] Elements self-liberate;
<tantra> [6398] Without doubt, becomes fortunate.
<tantra> [6399] Thus it is spoken.
<ornament> [6400] Third, showing the persons who hold, three:
[6401] The generally shown history of former arising,
[6402] Explaining the enumeration of obtained liberation,
[6403] Expressing the definite prophecy of vidyādhara.
[6404] First:
[6405] At the occasion of the arrangement of the field of the great Brahma teacher by primordial first king supreme Samantabhadra, having obtained clear light,
[6406] Vajradhara, and
[6407] That very teacher showing many other emanations of name-forms, arranged, and
[6408] From that blessing, having become Buddha, other arranged great Brahma aeons filling the sky's limit, numberless, expression-transcended—some empty, and
[6409] Some abiding, and
[6410] Some destroying, and
[6411] From some formed and abiding,
