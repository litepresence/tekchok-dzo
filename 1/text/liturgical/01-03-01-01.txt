[1582] The essential nature of basis and aggregates.
[1583] The distinctive characteristics of the forms and sense-sources.
[1584] The essential nature of the powers that grasp.
[1585] The various forms of objects and their possessors.
[1586] First:
[1587] Due to the vast and extensive meaning, this is termed "element."
[1588] If divided:
[1589] Those gathered by outer objects, and
[1590] Those gathered by inner mind—these two.
[1591] First:
[1592] There are five elements.
[1593] They produce and abide as form-possessing entities.
[1594] They serve as cause, condition, basis, and nature for destruction.
[1595] Earth possesses characteristics that are firm and solid.
[1596] Water possesses characteristics that are moist and flowing.
[1597] Fire possesses characteristics that are hot and burning.
[1598] Wind possesses characteristics that move and uplift.
[1599] Space possesses characteristics that are vast and open.
[1600] Through these, vessels and essences are produced and maintained.
[1601] From that itself, the five elements gathered by outer objects are:
[1602] The earth element produces the basis of body.
[1603] The water element holds names.
[1604] The fire element ripens objects.
[1605] The wind element sustains the entire moving world.
[1606] The space element holds the powers. Thus it is taught.
[1607] The elements gathered by inner mind appear as vessel and essence, two:
[1608] Vessel appears as objects, accumulated by actions.
[1609] If divided:
[1610] Those arising from the delusion of outer object-appearing mind, and
[1611] Those arising naturally from the luminosity of inner mind—these two.
[1612] First: The latency of object-appearing mind, like a dream.
[1613] If divided:
[1614] The four desire-realm continents and so forth.
[1615] The five form-objects: lights, self-arisen, like rainbows.
[1616] The formless objects: concentrations, self-emanated, invisible to others.
[1617] From the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
[1618] The elements gathered by inner mind are two:
[1619] The element of vessel that gathers beings, and
[1620] The element that arises from mind itself.
[1621] The element of vessel is:
[1622] The form element arising from the vast basis of beings' mindfulness.



[1623] The formless element arising from excessive mindfulness, and
[1624] The desire element arising from limited mindfulness. Thus it is taught.
[1625] Second: That which arises naturally from the luminosity of the inner mind:
[1626] Awareness exists, and through its self-arisen potency comes obscuration—the ignorance of the all-ground.
[1627] From that, arising from the all-ground consciousness, comes mind.
[1628] From that, the five gates of mind and faculties arise as knowing.
[1629] Like a wish-fulfilling tree grown from a golden ground, with branches, flowers, and leaves appearing.
[1630] Dividing this:
[1631] Objects,
[1632] Faculties of cognition,
[1633] Feelings—these three.
[1634] Objects are designated as the six bases of faculties when the mere knowing of the six consciousnesses, arising in this moment, is designated as object. Thus the six bases of faculties are named.
[1635] The faculties of cognition:
[1636] The six present knowings of eye and so forth.
[1637] Feelings:
[1638] The six types of future aspects.
[1639] Whatever object consciousness enters,
[1640] The previous six knowings that maintain continuum are called "objects."
[1641] The knowing that grasps the nature of that in a single moment is called "present knowing."
[1642] After that, feelings that gather as pleasure, pain, or neutrality are called "feelings of contact."
[1643] These arise from the gathering of object and knowing, which is the nature of feeling.
[1644] Thus, dividing the six groups into three types results in eighteen categories:
[1645] From that itself, the elements arising from mind itself are:
[1646] The eye element arising from the clear aspect of knowing,
[1647] The ear element arising from single-pointed knowing,
[1648] The nose element arising from limitless knowing,
[1649] The tongue element arising from knowing gathered as one,
[1650] The mind element arising from knowing that enters all,
[1651] The body element arising from knowing that serves as basis for the others.
[1652] 



[1653] Through holding name and form, the element of eye consciousness.
[1654] Through holding accomplished actions, the element of ear consciousness.
[1655] Through holding others in succession, the element of nose consciousness.
[1656] Through actual experience of objects, the element of tongue consciousness.
[1657] Through pervading all objects and the objectless, the element of mind consciousness.
[1658] Through gathering all meanings, the element of body consciousness.
[1659] Through grasping objects incorrectly and accomplishing objects, the eye gathers and there is the element of contact.
[1660] Through the ear holding and dispersing, there is the ear's gathering and the element of contact.
[1661] Through superior knowings gathering as one and attracting other minds, there is the nose's gathering and the element of contact.
[1662] Through following and taking nearby objects, there is the tongue's gathering and the element of contact.
[1663] Through gathering all mindfulness and entering all objects, there is the mind's gathering and the element of contact.
[1664] Through holding coarse many and arising, there is the body's gathering and the element of contact.
[1665] Therefore, these elements also accomplish the holding of objects.
[1666] These arise from the part that holds within delusion itself. Thus it is taught.
[1667] Second: The aggregates arise from the nature of basis and aggregates, gathered and assembled as one heap. This is called "aggregate."
[1668] If divided:
[1669] The aggregates with thought, and
[1670] The aggregates without thought—these two.
