[5] <prose> Thus having shown the distinction of alaya-ground and dharmakaya, and so forth,
[6] <prose> now, regarding the explanation of dependent arising's nature, there are two:
[7] <list> 1. The common distinction,
[8] <list> 2. The extensive explanation of individual natures.
[9] <prose> First:
[10] <prose> Outer-arising and inner-arising—two types. || 10 ||
[11] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[12] <verse> "The two types of arising are shown.
[13] <verse> Outer-arising and inner-arising."
[14] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[15] <prose> Outer-arising—earth, water, and so forth—these exist as the basis for inner-arising; connected as basis and dependent, therefore established as twofold.
[16] <prose> Without depending upon these two, no beings nor buddhas exist.
[17] <prose> All beings move within the confused expanse of the five-arising,
[18] <prose> possessing the self-nature of the great arising.
[19] <prose> All buddhas dwell in the expanse of the five pure-arisings: earth without solidity, and so forth,
[20] <prose> moving in the complete cessation of the five great arising's stains. || 20 ||
[21] <prose> Furthermore, the five great arising possess luminosity-wisdom and five colors;
[22] <prose> the five small arisings are earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[23] <prose> The five pure arisings are:
[24] <list> Clear,
[25] <list> Warm,
[26] <list> Bright,
[27] <list> Cool,
[28] <list> Spacious,
[29] <prose> holding the self-nature of movement.
[30] <prose> From the five confused arisings, the five luminous arrive in the expanse, meeting the inner expanse, || 30 ||
[31] <prose> like the purity of the great arising of spontaneous presence's appearance.
[32] <prose> Regarding the small arising, also arising-form,
[33] <prose> and actual arising—two.
[34] <prose> Arising-form is the five appearing now externally: earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[35] <prose> Actual arising is the five qualities of the body—thin, and so forth—becoming the five inner-arising bases.
[36] <prose> Inner-arising:
[37] <prose> The five individual dharma-arisings, bases of pure realms.
[38] <prose> Therefore all samsara and nirvana do not move from the expanse of the five-arising;
[39] <prose> before the five-arising, samsara and nirvana do not arise.
[40] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen: || 40 ||
[41] <verse> "Kye Ho! Secret Lord, listen!
[42] <verse> The characteristics of the five-arising:
[43] <verse> I show—you must understand.
[44] <verse> The great arising, Bhagavan,
[45] <verse> Exist as the nature of all beings.
[46] <verse> All beings of the three realms
[47] <verse> Move in the expanse of the five-arising.
[48] <verse> Before the time when the five-arising did not exist,
[49] <verse> Neither buddhas nor beings—even names did not exist.
[50] <verse> The five-arising themselves are the mother-expanse. || 50 ||
[51] <verse> Not established from the five-arising,
[52] <verse> Not even one birth-going being exists.
[53] <verse> The five-arisings of beings dwelling therein
[54] <verse> Are shown as twofold."
[55] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[56] <prose> Second: regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are two:
[57] <list> 1. The extensive explanation of outer-arising,
[58] <list> 2. The extensive explanation of inner-arising.
[59] <prose> First among these:
[60] <list> 1. Essence, || 60 ||
[61] <list> 2. Definitive terminology,
[62] <list> 3. Purpose,
[63] <list> 4. Characteristics,
[64] <list> 5. Sequence of functions,
[65] <list> 6. Dharma-nature,
[66] <list> 7. Applied meaning,
[67] <list> 8. Manner of liberation,
[68] <list> 9. Divisions,
[69] <list> 10. And the tenfold manner of completeness.
[70] <prose> First, the essence: || 70 ||
[71] <prose> Outer-arising appearing as form is the play of inner-arising's actuality;
[72] <prose> therefore, gathered within the inner domain, these are the five-arising.
[73] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[74] <verse> "The outer-arising are thus:
[75] <verse> Earth and water and fire,
[76] <verse> And likewise wind and space."
[77] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[78] <prose> The five forms of outer-arising become the appearing container-support for beings;
[79] <prose> the five actualities of inner-arising become the support for mind and awareness.
[80] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur: || 80 ||
[81] <verse> "The assertion regarding arising is thus:
[82] <verse> From the particularities of general-common karma,
[83] <verse> By individual karma-supports of beings,
[84] <verse> Relying upon the outer-arising,
[85] <verse> Karma, sustenance, and faculties,
[86] <verse> Entourage and birth—complete."
[87] <tantra> Thus.
[88] <prose> Second, the definitive terminology:
[89] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[90] <verse> "The definitive terminology of arising is thus: || 90 ||
[91] <verse> Not made by fabrication, spontaneously complete;
[92] <verse> By that which produces, they are arising;
[93] <verse> Pervading all migrators, they are great-arising;
[94] <verse> By simultaneous birth, they are great-arising;
[95] <verse> Existing in themselves, they are great-arising;
[96] <verse> Without change, they are great-arising;
[97] <verse> Appearing harmoniously, they are great-arising.
[98] <verse> The definitive terminology of great-arising—thus."
[99] <tantra> Thus.
[100] <prose> Third, the purpose: || 100 ||
[101] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[102] <verse> "The inquiry into arising's purpose is thus:
[103] <verse> Water gathers the clear essence
[104] <verse> And separates the impurities—this is its function.
[105] <verse> As it acts within each individual body,
[106] <verse> Its purpose is known as heat and cold.
[107] <verse> Earth holds the foundation
[108] <verse> And performs establishing and cohering functions.
[109] <verse> By ripening, it produces roots and so forth;
[110] <verse> Its purpose is known as the relative thigle. || 110 ||
[111] <verse> Fire increases the arising
[112] <verse> And performs ripening and clarifying functions.
[113] <verse> By blazing and spreading, it produces eyes and so forth;
[114] <verse> Its purpose is made known as warmth.
[115] <verse> Wind scatters and lifts
[116] <verse> And performs moving and quivering functions.
[117] <verse> By moving and trembling, it holds the body;
[118] <verse> Its purpose is known as the abode of mind.
[119] <verse> The four arising—the great mandala of self—
[120] <verse> Become the cause for accomplishing body and so forth, || 120 ||
[121] <verse> Abide in the middle and perform the holding function,
[122] <verse> And in the end perform all destruction functions.
[123] <verse> Through one cause, the great arising
[124] <verse> Appear as the master performing the various.
[125] <verse> Thus, regarding intention, self and other,
[126] <verse> Skilled in the meaning of completed action."
[127] <tantra> Thus.
[128] <prose> Fourth, the characteristics—from among five:
[129] <list> Earth-characteristic: solidity.
[130] <list> Water-characteristic: moisture. || 130 ||
[131] <list> Fire-characteristic: warmth.
[132] <list> Wind-characteristic: movement.
[133] <list> Space-characteristic: openness and spaciousness.
[134] <prose> Fifth, the sequence of functions:
[135] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[136] <verse> "The sequence of inner-arising's functions:
[137] <verse> Earth makes the body's basis;
[138] <verse> By producing, flesh ripening is asserted.
[139] <verse> Water gathers the entire body;
[140] <verse> By producing, blood ripening is asserted. || 140 ||
[141] <verse> Fire ripens the entire body;
[142] <verse> By producing, warmth ripening is asserted.
[143] <verse> Wind lifts the entire body;
[144] <verse> By producing, breath ripening is made."
[145] <tantra> Thus.
[146] <prose> Sixth, the dharma-nature:
[147] <prose> Though generally empty, here the dharma-nature that holds its own characteristic, made authoritative as dharma-nature:
[148] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[149] <verse> "The dharma-nature of the five-arising:
[150] <verse> Arising's cause is earth. || 150 ||
[151] <verse> Arising's wisdom is fire.
[152] <verse> Arising's emanation is wind.
[153] <verse> Arising's master is water.
[154] <verse> Arising's dharma-nature is space."
[155] <tantra> Thus.
[156] <prose> Seventh, the application of meaning—from two:
[157] <prose> The application of meaning to the five-arising's essence:
[158] <tantra> From That Very:
[159] <verse> "The application of meaning to arising is thus:
[160] <verse> Within dharmakaya nature, primordially pure, || 160 ||
[161] <verse> By essence without change, arising-earth also is.
[162] <verse> By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising-fire also is.
[163] <verse> By awareness-wisdom, unmoved, gone into expanse, arising-wind also is.
[164] <verse> By awareness-wisdom gathering three cavities as one, arising-water also is.
[165] <verse> By wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous manner, arising-space is."
[166] <tantra> Thus.
[167] <prose> The application of meaning connecting the five-arising's individual meanings with inner awareness:
[168] <tantra> From the Norbu 'phrul bkod:
[169] <prose> "The five outer-arising are the common dharma of self-continuum;
[170] <prose> by connecting all outer-appearing arising with self-awareness itself, they are the common dharma. || 170 ||
[171] <prose> The divisions are thus:
[172] <list> Earth-characteristic, making solidity, also—
[173] <prose> connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction.
[174] <list> Wind-characteristic, making lifting,
[175] <prose> connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction.
[176] <list> Fire-characteristic, making burning,
[177] <prose> connects with awareness-wisdom gone under afflictions' authority.
[178] <list> Water-characteristic, making moistening,
[179] <prose> connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects.
[180] <list> Space-characteristic, vastness, || 180 ||
[181] <prose> connects with awareness-characteristic without break in continuity—thus it is said."
[182] <prose> Eighth, the manner of the five-arising's liberation:
[183] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[184] <verse> "Space itself, by pervading emptiness,
[185] <verse> Space itself liberates as entity.
[186] <verse> Wind, by appearing without graspable object,
[187] <verse> Liberates into entity-gathering's function.
[188] <verse> Fire, by consuming what ripens,
[189] <verse> Liberates by moving and separating clear from impure.
[190] <verse> Earth, when making the producer lift, || 190 ||
[191] <verse> Liberates into limitless empty non-entity.
[192] <verse> Water, by moistening what gathers,
[193] <verse> Liberates into burning-ripening's function."
[194] <tantra> Thus.
[195] <prose> Explaining divisions:
[196] <prose> Each of the five-arising—earth of earth, and so forth—five sets of five;
[197] <prose> enumeration of portions: twenty-five.
[198] <tantra> Again from That Very:
[199] <verse> "Space's wind toward entity,
[200] <verse> Space's fire makes gathering, || 200 ||
[201] <verse> Space's water makes burning,
[202] <verse> Space's earth opens opportunity,
[203] <verse> Space's space appears.
[204] <verse> Wind's wind toward stability,
[205] <verse> Wind's space: great sound-potential,
[206] <verse> Wind's water: great quickness and speed,
[207] <verse> Wind's fire: great projection and gathering,
[208] <verse> Wind's earth: clear form-reflection.
[209] <verse> Water's water: sound-echo,
[210] <verse> Water's space: without obstruction, || 210 ||
[211] <verse> Water's wind: flows attachment-free,
[212] <verse> Water's fire: makes gathering,
[213] <verse> Water's earth: makes pervading.
[214] <verse> Fire's earth: makes producing,
[215] <verse> Fire's space: burns entity,
[216] <verse> Fire's wind: makes blazing,
[217] <verse> Fire's water: makes destroying,
[218] <verse> Fire's earth: holds.
[219] <verse> Earth's earth: pervades migrators,
[220] <verse> Earth's space: the mahayana, || 220 ||
[221] <verse> Earth's wind: makes snow-empty,
[222] <verse> Earth's water: produces entity,
[223] <verse> Earth's fire: dries."
[224] <tantra> Thus.
[225] <prose> By training in these distinctions, distinguished qualities; each accomplished. In that commentary it is explained—
[226] <tantra> From the Sound Thal 'gyur also, it is stated that by training in the elements' sound-meaning, common attainments are obtained.
[227] <verse> "By that sound-meaning's particularities,
[228] <verse> Definite showing of general forms.
[229] <verse> By training in form, body becomes exhausted.
[230] <verse> By sound, languages are known. || 230 ||
[231] <verse> By smell, taking essence is accomplished.
[232] <verse> By taste, entity becomes nectar."
[233] <tantra> Thus it is said; and
[234] <tantra> From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:
[235] <verse> "Earth, water, fire, wind—
[236] <verse> The four elements' sounds and meanings,
[237] <verse> By becoming familiar,
[238] <verse> The six races' self-sounds
[239] <verse> Arising clairvoyance accomplishes."
[240] <tantra> Thus. || 240 ||
[241] <prose> These are the outer-arising—all beings' support and abode.
[242] <ornament> Tenth, regarding that and also other topics—the manner of showing how samsara-nirvana dharmas are complete in the yogi's body-mind—threefold:
[243] <list> 1. Generally showing the partial-similarity completeness manner,
[244] <list> 2. Explaining in particular the body-mind completeness manner,
[245] <list> 3. Making understood through the play of great definite symbols.
[246] <prose> First:
[247] <prose> In this dharma of gathered body-mind of migrators, all primordially self-arise with complete parts—
[248] <prose> Father and mother as method and wisdom's portion;
[249] <prose> Karma-projecting wind as dharmakaya-awakening's portion;
[250] <prose> Five elements' seeds as five families' sound-potential's portion; || 250 ||
[251] <prose> Two equipoise essences as path's two accumulations' method-wisdom union's portion;
[252] <prose> Womb-abiding as base-expanse-abiding's portion;
[253] <prose> Body forming in seven seven-day sets as seven pure elements' seven paths' completing's portion;
[254] <prose> Ten womb months as ten grounds' completing's portion;
[255] <prose> Three-kaya buddhahood as path-completing's portion;
[256] <prose> Birth as emanation-body;
[257] <prose> Body-abiding engaging fields as enjoyment-body;
[258] <prose> Death as dharmakaya emptiness's portion arising;
[259] <prose> The manner in which migrators, primordially traversing base-path-result, are liberated.
[260] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng ba: || 260 ||
[261] <verse> "The Bhagavan spoke:
[262] <verse> Not liberated by effort,
[263] <verse> Abiding liberated from primordial.
[264] <verse> From method and wisdom's union, Father and mother are themselves the cause.
[265] <verse> Projecting wind's moving portion—
[266] <verse> Self-aware awakening, great bliss.
[267] <verse> Five-arising cause's seed
[268] <verse> Arises, appearing from emptiness-field.
[269] <verse> Two's bliss equipoise
[270] <verse> Is wisdom itself arisen from method. || 270 ||
[271] <verse> Womb-belly entering
[272] <verse> Is self-awareness arising from base.
[273] <verse> Seven seven-sets' realization measure.
[274] <verse> Ten months' grounds traversing.
[275] <verse> Birth itself is kaya-arising.
[276] <verse> Producing body is base-appearing field.
[277] <verse> Body-abiding is the base.
[278] <verse> Aging is delusion's confusion-awakening.
[279] <verse> Sickness itself is realization-confidence.
[280] <verse> By death, liberation into dharmata-emptiness. || 280 ||
[281] <verse> Thus all appearing beings
[282] <verse> Are primordially liberated without effort."
[283] <tantra> Thus.
[284] <prose> Connecting with delusion-reversing particular manner:
[285] <prose> Birth is awareness moving from expanse's portion.
[286] <prose> Body is the base.
[287] <prose> Outer-appearing portion is base-appearing spontaneous completion.
[288] <prose> Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face.
[289] <prose> Aging is truth-clinging's confusion-awakening.
[290] <prose> Death, when knowing self-face, shows final arrival at primordial purity's ground in inner expanse's portion. || 290 ||
[291] <prose> By these arising primordially, instruction introduction and
[292] <prose> empowerment,
[293] <prose> liberation through meditation—suitable.
[294] <prose> If complete in partial similarity, not able to liberate through instruction;
[295] <prose> by clearly showing that partial similarity exists, buddha's dharma it is called.
[296] <prose> Existing in base-path's primordial measure,
[297] <prose> what becomes shown as symbol-meaning by buddha's speaking also arrives at this essence.
[298] <prose> Second, explaining body-mind completeness manner in particular—threefold:
[299] <list> 1. Body,
[300] <list> 2. Mind, || 300 ||
[301] <list> 3. Awareness completeness manner.
[302] <prose> First:
[303] <prose> In this four-arising gathered aggregate, outer container-world's portion and
[304] <prose> inner essence-migrants' portions—all complete.
[305] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[306] <verse> "Earth, water, fire, wind,
[307] <verse> Space, sun, and moon,
[308] <verse> Born males and females' forms,
[309] <verse> Planets, stars, and clouds,
[310] <verse> Trees, mountains, and rocks, || 310 ||
[311] <verse> Roots, trunks, and branches,
[312] <verse> Leaves, flowers, and fruits,
[313] <verse> Smells, tastes, sounds, and touches.
[314] <verse> Music, canopies,
[315] <verse> Banners, and upper-canopies,
[316] <verse> Those appearing surrounding dharmas—
[317] <verse> Are complete in the yogi's own body."
[318] <tantra> Thus.
[319] <prose> Explaining these portions extensively:
[320] <list> Earth's portion: flesh; || 320 ||
[321] <list> Water's portion: blood;
[322] <list> Fire's portion: warmth;
[323] <list> Wind's portion: breath;
[324] <list> Space's portion: mind;
[325] <list> Sun-moon's portion: two eyes;
[326] <list> Male's portion: birth;
[327] <list> Female's portion: death;
[328] <list> Planet's portion: desire's gate-house and two nostrils;
[329] <list> Star's portion: teeth;
[330] <list> Cloud's portion: hair; || 330 ||
[331] <list> Tree's portion: channels;
[332] <list> Mountain's portion: whole similar body;
[333] <list> Rock's portion: bones;
[334] <list> Tree-root's portion: heart;
[335] <list> Branch's portion: limbs;
[336] <list> Flower's portion: five faculties of eye and so forth;
[337] <list> Fruit's portion: accomplished as body's happiness-suffering;
[338] <list> Sound's portion: voice;
[339] <list> Form's portion: body;
[340] <list> Smell's portion: pores; || 340 ||
[341] <list> Taste's portion: skin;
[342] <list> Touch's portion: sickness;
[343] <list> Music's portion: channels and internal organs;
[344] <list> Canopy's portion: urine;
[345] <list> Parasol's portion: legs;
[346] <list> Banner's portion: name;
[347] <list> Upper-canopy's portion: breath.
[348] <tantra> Also, from the Mu tig phreng ba, thus stated:
[349] <verse> "Earth is flesh, entity itself;
[350] <verse> Water is blood, gathering itself; || 350 ||
[351] <verse> Fire is warmth, ripening all body;
[352] <verse> Wind is breath, karma's container;
[353] <verse> Space is mind, body's potential;
[354] <verse> Sun-moon is eye, making clear;
[355] <verse> Male is birth itself;
[356] <verse> Female appears as death;
[357] <verse> Planet is in mouth, star is teeth;
[358] <verse> Cloud is in hair, tree is channels;
[359] <verse> Mountain is in body, rock is bones;
[360] <verse> Root is in heart, trunk is legs; || 360 ||
[361] <verse> Branches are in limbs;
[362] <verse> Flower itself is five faculties;
[363] <verse> Fruit is accomplished in body;
[364] <verse> Smell is pores, taste is skin;
[365] <verse> Sound is in voice, touch is sickness;
[366] <verse> Music is internal organs, canopy is water;
[367] <verse> Parasol is legs, banner is name;
[368] <verse> Upper-canopy is breath.
[369] <verse> These are complete in the yogi's body."
[370] <tantra> Thus. || 370 ||
[371] <prose> Second, in mind all samsara-nirvana dharmas, base and path, are completely present.
[372] <tantra> Again from That Very:
[373] <verse> "All white transcendence dharmas
[374] <verse> Are completely present in body-mind;
[375] <verse> Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence,
[376] <verse> Mandala, deity, offering,
[377] <verse> Mantra, mudra, concentration,
[378] <verse> Empowerment, samaya,
[379] <verse> Instruction-giving, experience,
[380] <verse> Likewise development stage, || 380 ||
[381] <verse> Hearing, contemplating, meditating,
[382] <verse> View, conduct, meditation,
[383] <verse> Giving, ethics, patience,
[384] <verse> Effort, concentration, wisdom,
[385] <verse> Power, aspiration, wisdom,
[386] <verse> Likewise method's perfection,
[387] <verse> Ten virtues' conduct, and so forth,
[388] <verse> Method and wisdom themselves,
[389] <verse> Thus, from and so forth,
[390] <verse> Those transcendence-indicating dharmas || 390 ||
[391] <verse> Abide completely in body-mind,
[392] <verse> Up to thus stated."
[393] <prose> Third, awareness completeness manner:
[394] <tantra> Again from that:
[395] <verse> "In whatever self-appearing awareness's face,
[396] <verse> All however-appearing dharmas are complete."
[397] <tantra> Thus stated; and
[398] <tantra> Thus in awareness itself:
[399] <verse> "Sun and moon: method and wisdom;
[400] <verse> Male: base, female: path; || 400 ||
[401] <verse> Planet: realization measure, star: dharma;
[402] <verse> Cloud: compassion pervading all;
[403] <verse> Tree: dharmata-expanding path;
[404] <verse> Mountain: view without change;
[405] <verse> Rock: dharmakaya free from birth and destruction;
[406] <verse> Root: all dharmas' one cause;
[407] <verse> Branch: awakening's branch itself;
[408] <verse> Trunk: one taste in emptiness;
[409] <verse> Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu;
[410] <verse> Flower: wisdom's lamp itself; || 410 ||
[411] <verse> Fruit: three kayas self-complete.
[412] <verse> Sound: dharmata-field's sound;
[413] <verse> Smell: buddha-speech's fame;
[414] <verse> Taste: experience's bliss taste;
[415] <verse> Touch: great concentration;
[416] <verse> Music: five's complete mandala;

[420] <verse> Banner: manifest realization's buddha; || 420 ||
[421] <verse> All dharmas in mind-itself's face
[422] <verse> Abide in primordial spontaneous completion's manner.
[423] <verse> Therefore, mind and entity dharmas
[424] <verse> Are all merely imputed."
[425] <tantra> Thus.
[426] <prose> Second meaning: inner-arising extensive explanation—two:
[427] <list> 1. Common divisions and
[428] <list> 2. Individual divisions' nature.
[429] <prose> First:
[430] <prose> Inner-arising: essence's five-arising inwardly rely upon body's five coarse arising; || 430 ||
[431] <list> 1. Wind and
[432] <list> 2. Fire and
[433] <list> 3. Earth and
[434] <list> 4. Water and
[435] <list> 5. Space—five, each abiding as five, twenty-five limbs.
[436] <prose> Thus, definite suitability: definite as five, depending on five different functions;
[437] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[438] <verse> "The five great arising are complete in one's own body.
[439] <verse> That also: five winds make wisdom-potential;
[440] <verse> Five fires make wisdom-potency; || 440 ||
[441] <verse> Five earths make wisdom-essence;
[442] <verse> Five waters make wisdom-object;
[443] <verse> Five spaces make wisdom-abode."
[444] <tantra> Thus.
[445] <prose> Second, five:
[446] <list> 1. Wind and
[447] <list> 2. Fire and
[448] <list> 3. Earth and
[449] <list> 4. Water and
[450] <list> 5. Space nature extensive explanation. || 450 ||
[451] <prose> First among these, from two:
[452] <list> 1. Root division extensive explanation and
[453] <list> 2. Branch division extensive explanation.
[454] <prose> Root division:

[456] <verse> "What are the five wind types?
[457] <verse> Life-holding wind and
[458] <verse> Color-radiance producing wind and
[459] <verse> Fire-equal wind and
[460] <verse> All-pervading wind and || 460 ||
[461] <verse> Compassionless karma wind—five."
[462] <tantra> Thus.
[463] <prose> Those winds abide in all beings' bodies' head and tail. Thus.
[464] <prose> That also: life-holding wind abides in life-channel;
[465] <prose> Color-radiance producing abides in chest;
[466] <prose> Fire-equal abides in navel;
[467] <prose> All-pervading abides, pervading whole body;
[468] <prose> Karma wind abides between heart and heart-membrane.
[469] <prose> Their functions also:
[470] <list> 1. Life-abiding and || 470 ||
[471] <list> 2. Radiance-producing and
[472] <list> 3. Food-digesting,
[473] <list> 4. Going-sitting, and
[474] <list> 5. Life-transference function performing—thus in sequence.
