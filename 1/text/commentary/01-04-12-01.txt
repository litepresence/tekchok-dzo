Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me to explain the difference between outer and inner tantra. I showed him my two hands. "This hand is outer," I said. "It washes, it purifies, it performs ritual. This hand is inner—it eats the five meats, drinks the five nectars, knows no pure or impure." He looked at his own hands for three days. Finally he understood: same hands, different view. The outer three vehicles rely on the three whites and so on, engage in bathing and purification, stay in retreat, and so forth—they become distressed. The inner ones consume the five meats and five nectars and so on, rely on consorts, and have no acceptance or rejection or pure/impure distinctions—superior to the lower.

The second has five divisions. Essence: the nature of spontaneously-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light's truth, directly realized without complication, achieving liberation in one lifetime. This is not a promise! This is a description of what's already true. Etymology: since great meaning is accomplished through effortless methods, the inner method vehicle. Purpose: accomplishing both attainments in one lifetime. Result: reaching Vajradhara's ground in this life. Divisions: Mahayoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, and Atiyoga pith instruction. From Self-Arisen Rigpa: "The inner is divided into three: Maha, Anu, and Ati." This old practitioner spent years trying to decide which one to practice. Should I start with Maha? Jump to Ati? His teacher laughed. "You're already practicing all three," she said. "You just don't know it yet."

The Mahayoga vehicle, the causal tantra: primarily through the generation stage method, meditation on the three samadhis realizing the great inseparability of truth, clear-empty wisdom of clear light. Divisions: ground, path, and result-focused; sadhana-focused; various-path-transformation positions—and so on. This yogi once collected one hundred Mahayoga sadhanas, thinking more practices meant more progress. He could barely complete one in a day. His teacher took ninety-nine away. "Now," she said, "you might actually finish something." The generation stage is powerful. You visualize the deity, you become the deity. But don't get stuck in the visualization. It's a tool, not the goal.

Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to explain Mahayoga ground, path, and result using his tent as an example. "The ground is like the tent itself," he said. "It's always here. The path is like entering the tent—you think you're going somewhere. The result is realizing you never left." This old practitioner nodded, then asked: "Where do you keep your confusion?" The hermit pointed to the corner of his tent where he'd piled his doubts. We both laughed. The ground, as the cause for clarifying, distinguished by the great freedom from elaboration of mind-as-such's ultimate truth, without effort or exertion, is great. Like gold and its yellowness being inseparable. You don't make gold yellow. You don't make mind enlightened.

The sadhana-focused tradition has divisions: body sadhana carrying Manjusri's mandala wheel as path; speech sadhana making Padma family Buddha; mind sadhana making Heruka Vajra family Buddha; quality sadhana making Ratna family Buddha; activity sadhana making Karma family Buddha. Their essence: through three samadhis, each sadhana's deity and oneself become inseparable. But this old practitioner asks: who is the one becoming inseparable? Find that one first.

[3376-3390]
Essence of sadhanas: through three samadhis (suchness, all-illuminating, causal), deity and self become inseparable. This is union—not two things merging, but recognition of never being separate. Like ice and water. Different appearances, same nature. This hermit practiced union for years. Thought he was becoming the deity. Finally saw: there was never separation, so no union needed. Just recognition. The three samadhis are the structure. Suchness—emptiness. All-illuminating—appearance. Causal—compassion. Three aspects of one reality. Base, path, and result all contained in these three.

[3390-3410]
Pure perception: seeing world as celestial palace, beings as deities. This transforms everything! The person who annoys you? Wrathful deity teaching patience. The beautiful sunset? Peaceful deity teaching appreciation. Nothing to reject, nothing to accept. Just—seeing differently. This old practitioner tried this. Failed often. Succeeded sometimes. Both are practice. Both are the path. The pure perception is not denial. It's not pretending. It's seeing the true nature of things. Everything is deity display. Everything is wisdom display. Even the confusion. Even the suffering. Especially those.
