Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me he had finally understood non-abiding. "I abide in non-abiding," he said proudly. I asked him: "Where do you put your pride?" He had no answer. The first position of higher Svatantrikas: through non-existence, objects are not established as ceasing. From the Mother Sutra: "Ultimately, samsara does not exist. Nirvana does not exist. Emptiness does not exist. Only words indicate meaning." This is their position. The higher Svatantrikas are called "higher" because they don't abide anywhere. They don't even abide in illusion-like existence. They transcend all positions, all establishments, all views.

This old practitioner spent three years memorizing the names of all the non-abiding positions. Conventional non-abiding, causal non-abiding, negation non-abiding, negator non-abiding, one non-abiding, many non-abiding, neither-one-nor-many non-abiding, mere-appearance non-abiding—countless variations. Each one more subtle than the last. Each one a finger pointing at the same moon. Finally his teacher asked: "Do you want to know the names of all the fingers, or do you want to see the moon?" He burned his list of names. Best fire he ever made. The warmth lasted for days.

The Prasangika Madhyamikas, while ultimately not established like that, and conventionally mere appearance established as illusion—all such positions being refuted—assert transcendence of existence and non-existence extremes, free from all positions. From the Samadhiraja Sutra: "Permanent and impermanent—these are extremes. Existent and non-existent—both are extremes. Therefore, having abandoned both extremes, the wise do not abide even in the middle." This yogi once thought "not abiding in the middle" meant finding another place to abide. Took him five years to understand: there's no place, not even "no place."

[3118-3131]
From the Kasyapa Parivarta: "The Tathagata's unborn dharmas—all phenomena are like the Sugata. Childish minds grasp at signs, so they engage in non-existent dharmas in this world." This old practitioner was that childish mind for forty years. Grasping at signs, engaging in non-existent dharmas, thinking he was practicing Dharma. The real practice began when he saw the grasping itself was empty. Not by trying to stop grasping. Just by seeing. From the Mulamadhyamakakarika: "What arises dependently, that is unceasing and unborn, not annihilated and not permanent, not coming and not going, not different and not one—peaceful, completely stilled from elaboration, that I prostrate to, the perfect Buddha's teaching, the sublime."

[3062-3067]
Higher Svatantrika, called "higher" because it doesn't abide anywhere. Conventional non-abiding, causal non-abiding, eight kinds of non-abiding—this is systematic philosophy. But the practitioner asks: what good is it? Can you rest in non-abiding? Can you live it? This hermit tried. Felt like trying to stand on air. Eventually, you either fall back into positions or you discover: the air was always solid ground. Just not the kind of solid you expected. The eight non-abidings are ways of saying "don't grasp." Don't grasp at conventional. Don't grasp at cause. Don't grasp at negation. Don't grasp at the negator. Don't grasp at oneness, manyness, neither, both. Just—don't grasp.

[3068-3075]
The eight non-abidings enumerated: conventional, causal, negation, negator, one, many, neither-one-nor-many, mere-appearance. Each is a way of not landing anywhere. But the listing itself becomes a place to land! This is the irony. You collect the non-abidings like trophies. "I know eight ways to not abide!" The knowing becomes the abiding. The list becomes the prison. This old practitioner had lists like this. Burned them all. The fire was warm. The ashes were light. The freedom was worth the loss of knowledge.

[3114-3117]
Prasangika: not only is nothing ultimately established, but conventionally too, all positions are refuted. No view to hold. No ground to stand on. Not even "no view" as a view. Not even "groundless" as ground. This is terrifying to the mind that wants something solid. Liberating to the mind that's tired of grasping. This hermit was terrified for years. Now he's tired. The tiredness is the beginning of liberation. When you have no ground, you have nothing to defend. When you have no view, you have nothing to argue. This is freedom. Not the freedom to do whatever you want. The freedom from wanting.

[3118-3131]
From the Mulamadhyamakakarika: what arises dependently is unceasing and unborn, not annihilated and not permanent, not coming and not going, not different and not one—peaceful, completely stilled from elaboration, that I prostrate to, the perfect Buddha's teaching, the sublime. Nagarjuna's verse is like a key. Opens all doors. But you have to use it, not just admire it. This old practitioner chanted this for years before he understood: the chanting was the teaching. Not the meaning of the words. The chant itself. The sound. The silence after. That was the prostration. That was the teaching. That was the sublime.

[3109-3113]
From the Refutation of Objections: "If I had any position, I would have that fault. Since I have no position, I am faultless." This is Prasangika confidence! No position to defend. No view to maintain. Nothing to be wrong about. But also—nothing to be right about. Can you live like that? This yogi tries. Sometimes succeeds. Sometimes fails. Both are okay. Neither is a position. The confidence comes from not having anything to lose. Not because you have something indestructible. Because you have nothing at all. This is the ultimate security. The security of insecurity.

[3114-3117]
Prasangika transcendence: not established ultimately, not established conventionally, all positions refuted. Yet—appearances function. Cause and effect operate. You can still eat, sleep, practice. The transcendence doesn't negate the conventional. It just doesn't grasp at it. This is the middle way in action. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. Just—functioning without fixation. This hermit practices this. Sometimes forgets. Remembers again. That's the practice. The remembering. The forgetting. Both empty. Both okay.

[3118-3131]
The six treatises of Nagarjuna listed here: Root Wisdom, Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning, Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness, Fine Analysis, Refutation of Objections, Establishment of Conventions. This old practitioner has studied them all. Can quote them. And? The quoting doesn't liberate. The studying doesn't free. Only seeing through the one who studies, who quotes. That's the liberation. The treatises are maps. You have to walk the territory. The territory is right here. In your mind. In your experience. Look. See. Be free.

[3126-3131]
Nagarjuna as the "second Buddha"—this is high praise! Turning the wheel of Dharma like the Buddha himself. His treatises as Buddha's speech, without distinction. This hermit agrees. Nagarjuna's words cut through like the Buddha's. Direct, uncompromising, liberating. But don't make Nagarjuna into an idol. Don't make his words into scripture to worship. Use them. Test them. See if they liberate. That's the only measure. If they don't liberate, discard them. If they do, don't cling to them. Use them and move on.

Emaho! Svatantrika, Prasangika, non-abiding, transcending extremes—all just words pointing to what cannot be pointed to. Nagarjuna wrote six treatises. His greatest teaching was the silence between the lines. The space around the words. The emptiness that holds them all. This is what he was pointing to. Not the words. The silence. Not the philosophy. The freedom. Emaho!
