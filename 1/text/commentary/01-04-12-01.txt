[3062-3067] The first position: through non-existence, objects are not established as ceasing. From the Mother Sūtra: "Ultimately, saṃsāra does not exist. Nirvāṇa does not exist. Emptiness does not exist. Only words indicate meaning." This is their position.

[3068-3113] Among these, there are countless variations: conventional non-abiding, causal non-abiding, negation non-abiding, negator non-abiding, one non-abiding, many non-abiding, neither-one-nor-many non-abiding, mere-appearance non-abiding, and so on. These are called the higher Svātantrikas. The Prasaṅgika Madhyamikas, while ultimately not established like that, and conventionally mere appearance established as illusion—all such positions being refuted—assert transcendence of existence and non-existence extremes, free from all positions. From the Samādhirāja Sūtra: "Permanent and impermanent—these are extremes. Existent and non-existent—both are extremes. Therefore, having abandoned both extremes, the wise do not abide even in the middle." From the Kāśyapa Parivarta: "The Tathāgata's unborn dharmas—all phenomena are like the Sugata. Childish minds grasp at signs, so they engage in non-existent dharmas in this world." From the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "What arises dependently, that is unceasing and unborn, not annihilated and not permanent, not coming and not going, not different and not one—peaceful, completely stilled from elaboration, that I prostrate to, the perfect Buddha's teaching, the sublime." From the Vigrahavyāvartanī: "If I had any position, then I would have this fault. Since I have no position, I am completely without fault." And: "Since there is nothing to be negated, I do not negate anything. Therefore you project the fault that I negate."

[3114-3117] They assert that no philosophical position constructed by mind exists, for elaboration is pacified. Although mere various appearances are established in the world, they have no position. Phenomena appearing as dharmas transcend true and false, existence and non-existence, free from extremes from this very moment—this is their view. This is the pinnacle of the Buddhists' philosophical assertions.

[3118-3131] The major texts of this are the Six Collections of Madhyamaka Reasoning: Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, Yuktiṣaṣṭikā, Śūnyatāsaptati, Vaidalyaprakaraṇa, Vigrahavyāvartanī, and Vyavahārasiddhi. Ārya Nāgārjuna first composed the extensive commentaries on the Four Noble Truths Dharma wheel. The middle composed the reasoning collections as commentaries on the Characteristics-free Dharma wheel. The last composed the praises as commentaries on the Ultimate-definitive Dharma wheel. Therefore, this master is the Second Buddha who turned the Dharma wheel, and his treatises are no different from the Buddha's word.
