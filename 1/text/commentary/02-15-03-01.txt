[669-676]
Particular explanation of five kayas

Three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects, though essence is one. From Self-Arising: "Three kayas, wisdom-appearance, without obstruction to anything, perceived objects being one, essence appearing individually." Not three separate things—one awareness, three ways of shining!

[677-684]
This is how awareness itself appears:
- Awareness without thought = dharmakaya essence
- Awareness uncensored and clear = sambhogakaya  
- Awareness appearing as whatever = nirmanakaya

Complete. Awakened. Right here, right now—not somewhere else, not later!

Emaho!
