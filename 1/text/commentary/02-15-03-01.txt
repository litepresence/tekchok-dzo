Particular explanation of five kayas The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. Recognition is immediate.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects, though essence is one. From Self-Arising: "Three kayas, wisdom-appearance, without obstruction to anything, perceived objects being one, essence appearing individually." Not three separate things—one awareness, three ways of shining!

This is how awareness itself appears:
- Awareness without thought = dharmakaya essence
- Awareness uncensored and clear = sambhogakaya 
- Awareness appearing as whatever = nirmanakaya Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Complete. Awakened. Right here, right now—not somewhere else, not later!

Emaho!

[Final]
The commentary ends where it began—in recognition. What Longchenpa revealed is what you are. Nothing was added; nothing was removed.
