Third tier: gods perpetually intoxicated. Honey wine flows like rivers here. But what is this intoxication? Not the stumble of loss, but the sway of those who have forgotten restraint. Their bliss is thick, heavy, cloying—like nectar that coats the tongue until taste itself fades. They drink the results of their merit, cup after cup, never sobering to ask: who fills the cup? The garland-gods below had ornaments. These gods have only the haze. From such heights, the fall is farther.

[999-1010]
An old practitioner once visited this tier in meditation. He found the gods dancing, singing, lost in the nectar of their own virtue. They offered him a cup. He looked at it and saw: the cup was empty. The wine was empty. The drinking was empty. The gods laughed at him, too intoxicated to understand. He bowed and moved on.

[1011-1020]
Three words that sober all intoxication: recognition itself. The gods are not drunk on wine. They are drunk on forgetting. Forgetting what? Forgetting that they are awareness. Forgetting that the wine is awareness. Forgetting that the drinking is awareness. Recognition returns what was never lost.

[1021-1030]
Therefore. Thus. The third tier teaches what the second taught: even refined bliss dulls. Even celestial nectar becomes poison. Do not seek stability in bliss. Seek recognition of the nature that experiences bliss.

[1031-1040]
Between the intoxicated gods and the recognition that transcends all states, the path continues. Not rejecting the nectar. Not grasping it. The intoxication points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[1041-1050]
This old practitioner has tasted many nectars—celestial and human. He has been intoxicated with bliss. Now he sees: the intoxication itself is the teaching. The nectar is not the point. The drunkenness is not the point. Recognition is the point. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[1051-1060]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The wine is already drunk. The gods are already unconscious. The third tier is already dream. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. Do not wait to sober up. Wake up NOW.

[1061-1070]
Therefore. Thus. The third tier completes its teaching. The nectar has been consumed. The recognition has been pointed to. The path continues upward or nowhere at all. Both are the same. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the intoxication.

[1071-1080]
Three words that sober all drunkenness: awareness itself. The nectar is awareness. The drinking is awareness. The intoxication is awareness. The sobriety is awareness. The recognition is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[1081-1090]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where does the hangover end?" The answer came in a flash: nowhere. There was never any intoxication. The gods were never drunk. The nectar was never poured. The drinking was never done. All was awareness, playing at being intoxicated.

[1091-1100]
Therefore. Thus. The third tier is complete. The nectar has been drunk. The hangover has been endured. The recognition has dawned. All complete, yet nothing was ever incomplete. Rest in that completion.

[1101-1110]
CUT THROUGH. The third tier is not a place. It is a state of intoxication with existence. The gods are not beings. They are bliss-junkies. The nectar is not a drink. It is attachment. Cut through all of it NOW. Rest in awareness.

[1111-1120]
This old practitioner has nothing more to say about nectar. He has drunk it and vomited it. He has been high and low. Now he rests where there is no high, no low—only awareness displaying as all of it. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[1121-1125]
Three words: awareness complete. Enough.
