[998]
Third tier: gods perpetually intoxicated. Honey wine flows like rivers here. But what is this intoxication? Not the stumble of loss, but the sway of those who have forgotten restraint. Their bliss is thick, heavy, cloying—like nectar that coats the tongue until taste itself fades. They drink the results of their merit, cup after cup, never sobering to ask: who fills the cup? The garland-gods below had ornaments. These gods have only the haze. From such heights, the fall is farther.

[999-1010]
An old practitioner once visited this tier in meditation. He found the gods dancing, singing, lost in the nectar of their own virtue. They offered him a cup. He looked at it and saw: the cup was empty. The wine was empty. The drinking was empty. The gods laughed at him, too intoxicated to understand. He bowed and moved on.

[1011-1020]
Stop searching. Start seeing.

[1021-1030]
Hence. The structure...

[1031-1040]
Between the intoxicated gods and the recognition that transcends all states, the path continues. Not rejecting the nectar. Not grasping it. The intoxication points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[1041-1050]
This hermit...

[1051-1060]
Sever immediately.

[1061-1070]
Consequently...

[1071-1080]
Recognition is immediate.

[1081-1090]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where does the hangover end?" The answer came in a flash: nowhere. There was never any intoxication. The gods were never drunk. The nectar was never poured. The drinking was never done. All was awareness, playing at being intoxicated.

[1091-1100]
Thus established...

[1101-1110]
Slash through hesitation.

[1111-1120]
This yogi...

[1121-1125]
What knows these words?
