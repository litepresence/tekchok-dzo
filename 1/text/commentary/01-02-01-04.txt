Third tier: gods perpetually intoxicated. Honey wine flows like rivers here. But what is this intoxication? Not the stumble of loss, but the sway of those who have forgotten restraint. Their bliss is thick, heavy, cloying—like nectar that coats the tongue until taste itself fades. They drink the results of their merit, cup after cup, never sobering to ask: who fills the cup? The garland-gods below had ornaments. These gods have only the haze. From such heights, the fall is farther.
