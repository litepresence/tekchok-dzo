[12351-12355]
This is the extraordinary method of the great perfection.

[12351-12361]
Dharmata bardo with kayas and wisdoms, light and color; thigle, elements' appearances—as whatever appears, dharmata's mansion."

Samsara's appearance

[12356-12380]
The four visions are the measure of your progress: the direct perception of dharmata, the increase of experience, the perfection of rigpa, and the exhaustion of phenomena. When the fourth is reached, buddhahood is attained.

[12362-12378]
: various flashing, flickering like dream appearances—true appearance, false mind's object. Six families' lights: white, blue, yellow, red, green, multicolored—each realm's objects appearing.

Bardo boundaries

[12379-12400]
: nature-abiding from leaving mother's womb until final death-sickness strikes; death-point from breath not yet ceased until inner breath stops; dharmata from inner breath stopped until clear light dawns and lhundrub appears; samsara from lhundrub ceasing and flickering dream-like appearance until entering mother's womb.

This

[12381-12405]
Do not think this is far away. The nature of your own mind is already perfect. The displays you see are already pure. The liberation you seek is already present. You need only recognize this!

[12401-12413]
is called "instruction for provisions when meeting the traveler"—provisions given to the traveler setting out on the death-journey, crucial instructions for the death-point's pain and various appearances.

Emaho!

[12406-12430]
The lama's introduction is like a spark that ignites the fire of wisdom. Your practice is like adding fuel to that fire. The result is like the blazing inferno that consumes all delusion. Let this fire burn brightly!

[12414-12440]
: nature-abiding bardo—entering the nest like a bird certain the hunter won't harm; death-point bardo—clearing the unclear like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror; dharmata bardo—confidence in self-appearing like meeting a familiar person or a child entering mother's lap; samsara bardo—guiding continuation like putting a stake in a narrow crack.

First

[12431-12455]
Some wonder whether the displays are external or internal. This very question shows delusion! In the nature of mind, there is no division of inner and outer. All displays are the play of your own awareness.

[12441-12460]
: like a bird checking if the hunter has left before entering its nest, without harm, established without need to eliminate elaborations, without doubt or obstruction—you too first desire liberation from samsara, examine which method is profound, which crucial point great. Whatever Dharma you have confidence in, do not reach final limit, doubt-enter, or not arrive at goal—abandon these three.

First hearing trains mind

[12456-12480]
When you understand this completely, you are liberated in the very moment of perception. Samsara and nirvana become one display. This is the great equal taste—the ultimate fruit of thod rgal practice.

Emaho!

[12461-12470]
; middle thinking decides; finally meditation practices—like building a nest comfortable, like entering without fear of danger or anxiety.

These extensively taught before; here briefly summarized

[12471-12495]
: looking at outer appearances, seeing objects like illusory deception—baseless empty self-form only. Though various phenomena appear, they are view-meditation-conduct's mirror, dharmata's play unceasingly appearing.

Like looking at a single poppy's stem

[12481-12505]
The essence of thod rgal is this: rest in the nature of your own mind and let the displays arise naturally. Do not try to create them, do not try to stop them. Simply recognize them as your own face.

[12496-12515]
—white, red, various colors—all are your own mind's empty play. Seeing thus, appearances are liberated where they appear, confusion baselessly liberated, illusion's peak only appearing, liberated from outer objects' grasping samsara.

Emaho!

[12506-12521]
The five lamps are the supports for this practice, but the real lamp is the lamp of wisdom in your own heart.

[12516-12521]
: moving-empty beyond partiality, har-sang without clarity, self-clear recognizing—great dharmata beyond arising-abiding-ceasing is recognized.
