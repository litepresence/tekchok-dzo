Second, increasing—unchangeable channel-heart light expands the body, great increasing activity! In the great unchangeable channel, body of great increasing activity, five lights expanding five bodies, awareness body expanding expanse, bodies of pristine cognition expanding expanse, light-rays expanding expanse—thus body and pristine cognition in non-abiding mandala, entering Buddha's path! Emaho! Four activities spontaneously accomplishing!

[1665-1709]
Listen, fortunate practitioner! Four powers gather in this appearance—understand! Bardo reality's pure appearance gathers four powers: distant-grasping and direct light-luminous two powers gather; expanse progress pristine cognition four-link power gathers; bindu measure reaching union mandala appearance power gathers; wisdom exhaustion spontaneous-accomplishment appearance power gathers.

From Self-Arising: activity power mandala! Self abiding in conch-shell mandala, four aspects of lamp clear, showing this: awareness' expanse by lamp, body pristine cognition power gathers; bindu empty by lamp, outer element power gathers; wisdom self-arisen by lamp, self that power gathers; distant-grasping water lamp by, delusion that power gathers; awareness concept-free great by, concept affliction power gathers—unchangeable great Buddha path, bardo appearance power gathers! Thus power mandala, self body complete!

Four fierceness: awareness resonance mind projects and gathers, realizes assembly, affliction possessing sense-faculty each gate exit arises! Not realizing, samsara itself not revolving produces delusion-appearance. Realizing, power trains, arises-by arises-liberated type without, like water dissolving into water-wave, awareness-top dissolves action!

From Self-Arising: fierce Buddha activity! Self to sense-faculty gate, fierce activity mandala abides! Eye sense-faculty not ceasing, object grasping concept explains fierce activity! Consciousness object arises, fierce mandala one—think! Affliction thousand thousand eighty itself, object arises engages, fierce activity shows! Thus activity four aspects, self-self body complete!

Emaho! Power mandala of spontaneous accomplishment!

Look here, you who seek liberation! Longchenpa now reveals the four enlightened activities (*'phrin las rnam pa bzhi*) through the four bardos. This isn't some abstract theory—this is the road map for your own death and rebirth!

[1711-1712]
First, the **pacifying activity** in the **first bardo of clear light**: When the ground clear light dawns after death, you see the sphere of light (*'od gsal gyi tshom bu*)—like the sky at dawn. This is your chance! Not tomorrow, not in the next life—RIGHT THEN. If you recognize this as your own nature, you are liberated on the spot. If you miss it, you fall into the next bardo.

[1713-1714]
Second, the **enriching activity** in the **second bardo**: The four wisdoms linked together appear—this is like finding treasure in your own pocket. The four wisdoms are: mirror-like, equality, discriminating, and all-accomplishing. They're not somewhere else—they're the nature of your own confusion!

[1715-1716]
Third, the **power activity** in the **third bardo**: You see the eight gates of spontaneous preciousness (*lhun grub rin po che'i sgo brgyad*). This is like standing before eight doors, all leading to liberation. The power activity means you have the capacity to choose—but only if you recognize!

[1717-1720]
Fourth, the **fierce activity** in the **fourth bardo**: Self-appearance liberates itself in primordially pure ground. This is the fierce truth—there's nothing to do! No meditation, no practice, no effort. Just recognize and you're free.

From the *Rang Shar* Tantra—don't look for these four activities outside. They're your own mind's display. The path is complete right here.

Emaho! Four activities, four opportunities!
