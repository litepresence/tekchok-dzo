Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals continuous yoga. First: chain rope eye not move gaze view, that state not distracted meditate meditation, chain rope appearance conduct conduct, dimension rigpa stable fruit.

This old practitioner once tried to force continuous practice—every moment, every breath, every thought. He exhausted himself. Then his teacher said, "Continuous does not mean effortful. Like a river flowing, it continues without trying. Rest in the nature, and continuity is natural."

[20000-20025]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Conduct continuous yogin: chain rope essence and, four time not separate, conduct continuous yogin. Self-aware meditation continuum nonexistent though, meditation continuous yogin arise. Time and not time all, chain rope not separate, meditation continuous yogin.

Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Second, deviation place identify.

This old hermit saw a man gazing at a mountain until he became the mountain. This is the danger—deviation into eternalism. Another gazed at emptiness until nothing existed. This is the danger—deviation into nihilism. The middle way avoids both extremes, like a bird flying between sky and earth.

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Conduct continuous yogin, deviation aspect three exist—all appear mad conduct, god demon deviate; meaningless word conduct, existence view deviate; six groups object appear all, child conduct, unspecified place deviate. Meditation continuous yogin—don't think deviation only means wrong view!

[20060-20085]
Between right and wrong, the vast middle way opens. The deviations are not punishments; they are natural consequences of misunderstanding. Like planting wheat and expecting rice—the deviation is in the cause, not the result. Correct the view, and the result corrects itself.

Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Deviation into four formless realms—emptiness attachment. Deviation into seventeen form realms—thing attachment.

Voice 20 proclaims: Continuous yoga is not about duration but recognition. A moment of recognition is worth more than years of meditation without understanding. Like a flash of lightning in a dark valley—brief, yet revealing everything. This is the nature of direct recognition.

[20140-20165]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The deviations are warnings, not condemnations. They show what happens when wisdom is misunderstood. Stay in the middle way—neither grasping at appearance nor rejecting it, neither clinging to emptiness nor denying it.

[20160-20180]
This old hermit's final advice: Don't fear deviation; recognize it. If you find yourself in a formless realm, smile and return. If you find yourself in eternalism, laugh and release. The nature is never lost; only recognition wavers. Recognition returns, and the nature is clear again.
