This old hermit saw a man gazing at a mountain until he became the mountain. This is the danger—deviation into eternalism. Another gazed at emptiness until nothing existed. This is the danger—deviation into nihilism. The middle way avoids both extremes, like a bird flying between sky and earth.

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Conduct continuous yogin, deviation aspect three exist—all appear mad conduct, god demon deviate; meaningless word conduct, existence view deviate; six groups object appear all, child conduct, unspecified place deviate. Meditation continuous yogin—don't think deviation only means wrong view!

[20060-20085]
Between right and wrong, the vast middle way opens. The deviations are not punishments; they are natural consequences of misunderstanding. Like planting wheat and expecting rice—the deviation is in the cause, not the result. Correct the view, and the result corrects itself.

Voice 20 proclaims: Continuous yoga is not about duration but recognition. A moment of recognition is worth more than years of meditation without understanding. Like a flash of lightning in a dark valley—brief, yet revealing everything. This is the nature of direct recognition.

The framework reveals...

[20160-20180]
This old hermit's final advice: Don't fear deviation; recognize it. If you find yourself in a formless realm, smile and return. If you find yourself in eternalism, laugh and release. The nature is never lost; only recognition wavers. Recognition returns, and the nature is clear again.

[20170-20190]
Voice 20 proclaims: Continuous yoga is the yoga of no-yoga. Not maintaining continuity but recognizing continuous nature. Like a river doesn't try to flow; it flows naturally. The yogi doesn't try to practice; practice happens naturally when recognition is stable.
