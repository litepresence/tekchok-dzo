Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals distinctions. First: mind non-conception and rigpa non-conception two non-think similar, though rigpa direct, mind coiled abide difference exist. Second, rigpa depth clear object not arise, mind self-abide coiled two self-abide similar, though rigpa clear object nonexistent, mind object-possess grasp bound.

[20285-20305]
This old practitioner once thought non-conception was the goal. He sat for hours without thought, proud of his achievement. Then his teacher asked, "Is a stone in samadhi? A corpse? Non-conception is not the measure—recognition is."

[20305-20325]
Voice 20 proclaims: Third, rigpa self-abide meditation and channel wind rest meditation two one-pointed abide similar, though self-force meditation moist with always exist, channel wind meditation dull excitement much effort condition exist difference.

[20320-20345]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Fourth, rigpa self-arise object appear and concept projection two object spread similar similar similar, though rigpa spontaneous arise grasp-free liberated, concept grasp-holder grasp object outward draw difference.

[20335-20360]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Fifth, dharma-nature bardo and yidam deity illusory body two deity body appear similar, though appearance vast small and self-appearance know time liberate not liberate difference. Dharma-nature bardo rigpa resonance appearance, deity illusory body concept familiarization do.

[20350-20375]
This old hermit once saw a yogi practicing deity yoga. The form was beautiful, radiant. But when the session ended, the yogi returned to ordinary confusion. Another yogi saw only light, no form. Which is better? The one who recognizes the nature, regardless of appearance.

[20375-20400]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Sixth, nature emanation field appear and mother bardo Buddha pure field show Buddha two, enjoyment appearance part pure field with similar similar similar, though nature emanation self-appearance spontaneous door arise, mother bardo confusion appearance stagnant mother meet appear difference. Actually self-appearance other-appearance distinction.

[20390-20415]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The distinctions are not judgments but precise diagnoses. Like a doctor distinguishing between symptoms—similar appearances, different causes, different treatments. Know the distinctions, or treat the wrong disease.

[20410-20435]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Seventh, final liberation place primordially pure and indefinite basis spontaneous two rigpa quality essence nature compassion etc. similar, though stain pure impure and confusion basis do not do distinction.

[20425-20450]
This old hermit once heard two teachers: one said liberation is definite, one said spontaneous. He was confused until he realized—they were speaking of the same nature from different aspects. Like describing water as wet and as thirst-quenching—both true, neither the full description.

[20445-20470]
Voice 20 proclaims: Eighth, lower mind examine view meditation and rigpa direct view meditation two name similar, though faculty and rigpa appear not appear difference great. Ninth, rigpa body and concept deity body two deity see similar, though vast small and permanent impermanent and concept familiarization do need not need distinction.

[20460-20485]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Tenth, rigpa appearance object self-arise and delusion appearance various arise two impure thing this appear similar, though yogi water moon dream like nature nonexistent appear, not bind, ordinary bind difference.

[20480-20505]
This old practitioner offers final teaching on distinctions: Don't use distinctions to create hierarchies. They are medicine for specific diseases, not rankings. The best medicine is the one that cures your illness—not the most expensive or most rare.

[20500-20525]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Eleventh, light clear primordial resonance bindu and wind mind grasp rainbow light bindu two empty form arise similar, though nature pure bindu dimension rigpa appearance, clear and temporary improvement mandala between arise, wind grasp not depend, affliction concept self-cease, clear self-abide meditation ornament, channel wind sign ten pure wind effort trace follow, increase decrease many not stable, not clear, part decrease, concept affliction coarse later clear arise, abide part moist small etc., distinction very great.

[20520-20545]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The distinctions between systems—path fruit, six applications, Guhyasamaja subtle drop etc. meditation time arise, though heart essence direct and two gold brass distinction exist. Twelfth, liberation place dimension primordially pure and practice time outer inner dimension primordially pure two rigpa pervade cut not.

[20540-20560]
This old hermit's final word: Don't argue about which system is best. They are all fingers pointing. The finger that points most clearly for you is the best finger—for you. Don't try to use someone else's prescription for your illness.
