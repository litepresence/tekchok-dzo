Thus. We proceed...

This yogi...

Voice 20 proclaims: Third, rigpa self-abide meditation and channel wind rest meditation two one-pointed abide similar, though self-force meditation moist with always exist, channel wind meditation dull excitement much effort condition exist difference.

[20320-20345]
Look. It is here.

[20335-20360]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[20350-20375]
This old hermit once saw a yogi practicing deity yoga. The form was beautiful, radiant. But when the session ended, the yogi returned to ordinary confusion. Another yogi saw only light, no form. Which is better? The one who recognizes the nature, regardless of appearance.

[20375-20400]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Sixth, nature emanation field appear and mother bardo Buddha pure field show Buddha two, enjoyment appearance part pure field with similar similar similar, though nature emanation self-appearance spontaneous door arise, mother bardo confusion appearance stagnant mother meet appear difference. Actually self-appearance other-appearance distinction.

[20390-20415]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The distinctions are not judgments but precise diagnoses. Like a doctor distinguishing between symptoms—similar appearances, different causes, different treatments. Know the distinctions, or treat the wrong disease.

[20410-20435]
In this manner...

[20425-20450]
This old hermit once heard two teachers: one said liberation is definite, one said spontaneous. He was confused until he realized—they were speaking of the same nature from different aspects. Like describing water as wet and as thirst-quenching—both true, neither the full description.

[20445-20470]
Voice 20 proclaims: Eighth, lower mind examine view meditation and rigpa direct view meditation two name similar, though faculty and rigpa appear not appear difference great. Ninth, rigpa body and concept deity body two deity see similar, though vast small and permanent impermanent and concept familiarization do need not need distinction.

[20460-20485]
Hence. The structure...

A practitioner...

[20520-20545]
Consequently...

[20540-20560]
This old hermit's final word: Don't argue about which system is best. They are all fingers pointing. The finger that points most clearly for you is the best finger—for you. Don't try to use someone else's prescription for your illness.
