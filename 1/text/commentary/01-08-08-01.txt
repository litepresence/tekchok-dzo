[10830-10848]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes the logical debate regarding the non-dual basis. Second: the unsurpassed basis particularly explained according to the tradition of Great Perfection has three principal parts. First: the common brief presentation of the essential nature. The beginning basis of all—the essence, primordially pure like a conch shell pure and unmixed with stains; the nature, spontaneously accomplished, not established as any limited thing or mark. Inside the white mandala, having subtle self-light as depth-clarity shining, although conditions not existing, therefore not appearing outwardly to deluded perception.

[10834-10844]
This old practitioner has seen the youth vase body in vision—not as an external deity, but as the unborn nature itself. Outside, limitless, unobstructed and unbound, it abides as the actual state of reality. The essence primordially pure yet empty of inherent existence; though no thing exists as real, the subtle awareness with primordial resonance and self-light is not restricted by any condition, naturally self-possessed. This is not philosophy—it is the direct recognition of what has always been.

[10836-10848]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The youth vase body is not a form to be visualized but the actual state beyond form. It is the basis, the ground, the secret treasury. Those who seek it outside themselves search in vain. Those who seek it inside find nothing to grasp. It is the seeking itself that obscures.

[10841-10850]
Voice 20 proclaims: Inside the vast expanse of essence primordially pure, the primordial resonance of nature spontaneously accomplished, depth-clarity, subtle self-light, together with pristine cognition—these are one in essence, different in aspect, not separate in manner. This is the light-clear supreme spontaneous presence jewel casket of all qualities! The youth vase body field of natural perfection! Essence, nature, and compassion three as one possession supreme abides as the basis!

[10846-10855]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals: Because essence is empty, it is not established as limited thing and mark. Because nature is clear, primordial resonance in appearance with own-face not abandoned. Because compassion is awareness that knows, pristine cognition expanding everywhere, arise-base of all not ceasing abides as the ground. From this non-dual nature, the great Auspicious Beautiful Tantra speaks.

[10850-10857]
Between arising and non-arising, the vast middle way opens like space itself. Before realized Buddha ever arose as other, before unrealized sentient beings appeared as deluded, awareness self-arisen wisdom, unmoved from basis of all, condition-not-existing appearance of three bodies together abide. Then again the Teacher, awareness pristine cognition itself, this actual state of own abiding manner spoke for disciples.

[10856-10864]
This old hermit remembers the first time these words pierced his heart. "O appearance great vast expanse this very mind, from unmoving Dharmakaya great beyond all change, abide as Buddha great not confused by any delusion." The essence body not ceasing abides from beginningless time. Essence not changing in its nature. Method secret beyond expression. Unmoved by any condition. Not moving from own place. Not shaken by any wind of concept.

[10865-10876]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: All appearances complete at one time beyond sequence! All pristine cognition complete at one moment without effort! All bodies mature abiding in perfection! All light appearance unobscured clear luminosity! Yet you seek completion through practice, through time, through effort! CUT THROUGH NOW! The completion is not something you achieve—it is the nature of things as they already are!

[10871-10882]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. That great actual-state of essence also abides like the vast body of reality itself, yet the eyes, ears, and nose as sense faculties are not abiding as substantially real entities. It abides like emptiness itself; yet falling into a reified emptiness is not its abiding. In the great appearance manifesting like the five wisdom lights, dividing into limited, graspable color is not its mode of abiding. In appearance without interruption or ceasing, connection like cause-and-effect is not established.

[10877-10891]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The five lights appear—vast as space, clear as crystal, unmixed yet not separated. They do not abide in categories. You cannot put them in boxes. White, red, yellow, green, blue—these are not marks but the spontaneous display of awareness. They are the youth vase body showing its own face.

[10883-10898]
This old practitioner once spent a year trying to see the five lights in meditation. Then one morning, washing his face in the mountain stream, he saw them—not in his mind, but in the water itself, in the sunlight on the ripples, in the reflection of his own face. The five lights are not visions; they are the nature of all appearance to pure perception.

[10892-10906]
From the tantra: Natural expression appearance is like vast space appearing, direction-falling without any limit. Like clear water appearing, thing to grasp without any nature. Like deep-blue lapis appearing, not divided by part or section. Like white conch appearing, order and sequence not holding. Like yellow gold appearing, qualities spontaneously complete. This is the spontaneous presence of the basis—not created, not fabricated, naturally perfect.

[10897-10908]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes. Compassion appearance manifests as like empty space appearing, clarity not ceasing anywhere. Without elaboration of concept, great elaboration of qualities complete. Nature not ceasing in essence, various not determined as fixed categories. Clear luminosity without limit, darkness nowhere to be found. This is the great play of the non-dual basis—primordially pure in essence, spontaneously present in nature, all-pervading in compassion.

[10907-10924]
Voice 20 proclaims: Complete as one appearance great without duality! Compassion not ceasing abides thus from beginningless time! From the Thalgyur Tantra: First essence nature spontaneously present, and compassion three aspects inseparably abiding. That also essence as body abiding, Dharma enjoyment emanation three aspects, not divided yet dividing without manner. By spontaneous force accomplished itself also, body color and qualities mind-object without. Natural expression appearing as light manner—this is the secret of the youth vase body!

[10925-10937]
This old hermit offers final advice: Do not seek the basis in texts or teachings. Do not seek it in meditation or practice. The basis is the very awareness that reads these words, that recognizes its own nature. Primordially pure, spontaneously present, non-dual from the first—this is not a philosophy to be learned but a recognition to be lived. The eighth chapter concludes, but the recognition continues without end.
