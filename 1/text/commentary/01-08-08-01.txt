The framework reveals. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[10834-10844]
A simple monk. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[10836-10848]
Recognition is immediate. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[10841-10850]
Voice 20 proclaims: Inside the vast expanse of essence primordially pure, the primordial resonance of nature spontaneously accomplished, depth-clarity, subtle self-light, together with pristine cognition—these are one in essence, different in aspect, not separate in manner. This is the light-clear supreme spontaneous presence jewel casket of all qualities! The youth vase body field of natural perfection! Essence, nature, and compassion three as one possession supreme abides as the basis!

[10846-10855]
Analysis proceeds. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[10850-10857]
Between arising and non-arising, the vast middle way opens like space itself. Before realized Buddha ever arose as other, before unrealized sentient beings appeared as deluded, awareness self-arisen wisdom, unmoved from basis of all, condition-not-existing appearance of three bodies together abide. Then again the Teacher, awareness pristine cognition itself, this actual state of own abiding manner spoke for disciples.

[10856-10864]
This old hermit remembers the first time these words pierced his heart. "O appearance great vast expanse this very mind, from unmoving Dharmakaya great beyond all change, abide as Buddha great not confused by any delusion." The essence body not ceasing abides from beginningless time. Essence not changing in its nature. Method secret beyond expression. Unmoved by any condition. Not moving from own place. Not shaken by any wind of concept.

[10865-10876]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: All appearances complete at one time beyond sequence! All pristine cognition complete at one moment without effort! All bodies mature abiding in perfection! All light appearance unobscured clear luminosity! Yet you seek completion through practice, through time, through effort! See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The completion is not something you achieve—it is the nature (rang bzhin) of things as they already are!

[10871-10882]
Thus. We proceed. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[10877-10891]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The five lights appear—vast as space, clear as crystal, unmixed yet not separated. They do not abide in categories. You cannot put them in boxes. White, red, yellow, green, blue—these are not marks but the spontaneous display of awareness. They are the youth vase body showing its own face.

[10883-10898]
This old yogi. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[10892-10906]
From the tantra: Natural expression appearance is like vast space appearing, direction-falling without any limit. Like clear water appearing, thing to grasp without any nature. Like deep-blue lapis appearing, not divided by part or section. Like white conch appearing, order and sequence not holding. Like yellow gold appearing, qualities spontaneously complete. This is the spontaneous presence of the basis—not created, not fabricated, naturally perfect.

[10897-10908]
Accordingly. The analysis. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[10907-10924]
Voice 20 proclaims: Complete as one appearance great without duality! Compassion not ceasing abides thus from beginningless time! From the Thalgyur Tantra: First essence nature spontaneously present, and compassion three aspects inseparably abiding. That also essence as body abiding, Dharma enjoyment emanation three aspects, not divided yet dividing without manner. By spontaneous force accomplished itself also, body color and qualities mind-object without. Natural expression appearing as light manner—this is the secret of the youth vase body!

[10925-10937]
This old hermit offers final advice: Do not seek the basis in texts or teachings. Do not seek it in meditation or practice. The basis is the very awareness that reads these words, that recognizes its own nature. Primordially pure, spontaneously present, non-dual from the first—this is not a philosophy to be learned but a recognition to be lived. The eighth chapter concludes, but the recognition continues without end.
