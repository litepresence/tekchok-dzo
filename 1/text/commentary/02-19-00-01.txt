Listen here, dear practitioner! Dharmas exhausted, intellect-transcended meaning—zinc-tin reliance, wisdom change-change not recognized! In effortless vast great expanse, all primordially transcended. Bondage and liberation, abandon-accept not-existing manner—samsara nirvana nameless great roll!

[5969-5977]
First three: Nature Dzogchen byar not sky-like meaning generally shown. Bondage liberation non-dual, own-mind emptiness root-free great thig-decided. Object-vision, mind's mirror collection, six great pervade! Outer vision, inner awareness, between grasping-holding, vision signs, samsara nirvana gathered dharmas all—primordial emptiness universal emptiness great! Appearance-emptiness, intellect-emptiness great! Pure-emptiness, liberation-emptiness great! Not experienced existent, not experienced non-existent. Not experienced true, not experienced false. Not experienced deluded, not experienced liberated. Not experienced samsara!

Do you see? Not experienced! All these categories—samsara, nirvana, true, false—you never experienced them! They are empty from the start!

Emaho! The three great emptinesses—beyond all experience!

[6027-6031]
Listen, dear practitioner! Liberation arisen transcending object and thought! Roll into liberation direction-limitless, nameless! Not-look, look not—look-doer not, looked not see!

[6032-6035]
Not-meditate, meditated not, transcended meditation, meditated also not liberated!

[6036-6041]
Not-analyze, analyzed not, analysis not needed, analyzed also effort meaningless! Accomplishment not needed—already accomplished!

[6042-6048]
Spontaneous self-liberation is the view! Effort-free self-established meditation! No-activity conduct! Result without hope! Dharmata's correct view spontaneously establishes all!

[6049-6052]
From the Treasury: All these essence meanings are spontaneously presence's meaning! Not-thinking meditation is also meditation! Beyond intellect, spontaneously establish great!

Do you see, practitioner? You are looking for something that was never lost! Not-look, because there is nothing to see. Not-meditate, because you are already awakened. Not-analyze, because analysis is just more mind. Stop all this doing! Rest in what you already are!

Emaho! Spontaneous liberation beyond all meditation!

Dear one, you have always been the Buddha - you merely forgot! Emaho!

[6139-6143]
Listen, dear practitioner! The nature of visionary delusion—this is wisdom! Previously you did not see it as wisdom. Because the basis of conceptual delusion does not exist, the alaya is realized as the great dharmakaya. The continuity of delusion's self-concept has ceased!

[6144-6149]
Thus, delusion-free vision arises from the key point of primordial fallenness. The aggregates of beings are the Buddha body—who does not know they are primordially so? The aggregates as Buddha, the lord of possession, channels and letters completely arise from the basis!

[6150-6153]
Like bubbles in the eyes—who has not seen that wisdom is self-appearance?

Do you see, practitioner? Your delusion is wisdom! Your aggregates are Buddha! What you took as impure is primordially pure. What you took as deluded is primordially awake. Do not try to purify what is already pure. Do not try to wake up what is already awake. Simply recognize what you are—this is the Great Perfection!

Emaho! Your aggregates are the Buddha body—recognize this!

[6208-6211]
. Do not spontaneously complete before that itself meaning [6212].

Do and and doer where exist, conduct not dharmata self arise this

[6213-6214]
. Whatever direction-to not fall sky like, exist not is empty one only

[6215-6216]
. Not-exist not is true bliss body, make not is self arise concept not

[6217-6218]
.

Great perfection ati yoga-to, meditate dharmata where exist

[6219-6220]
. Send and keep not dharma, meditate and not meditate end-from free

[6221-6222]
. Hold not mind defilement what, true awareness defilement not

[6223-6224]
. Defilement not pure dharmakaya-to, meditate and meditate do not

[6225-6226]
.

Meditate-by true itself not find, find self awareness not become

[6227-6228]
. Why self awareness wisdom-to, distracted and not distracted not cause

[6229-6230]
. What-to hold exist-to, self arise wisdom exist not

[6231-6232]
.

Thus and: again that also dharma all thus, birth not-from cease not, hold not-from self place free

[6233-6237]
. Reference not-from elaborate not, make-from not arise all-to exist, unconditioned-from fully pure expanse

[6238-6240]
. Hold term dharma separate, nature not-exist-from express separate

[6241-6242]
.

Thus and Nor bu phra bkod from: "Ha ha, dharma not-from dharmata arise, object not-from object like vision, dharma not wisdom interior clear-from, memory not object-to not-exist"

[6243-6250]
.

Thus and Seng ge rtsal rdzogs from: "Hold attachment not dharmata entity free this, Buddha all two not intention supreme, discriminate and mark word path, action effort not dharmata self place pure, ub chub samadhi dharmata object-to enter, pure and not pure term dharma not, one and two-from exceed primordial abide meaning, self body manner-to bindu one-by ub"

Dear practitioner, do not meditate! Simply rest in what you already are! Emaho!

[6314-6320]
Listen, dear practitioner! From the Condensed Sutra: "Tathagatas always arisen, non-existing dharmas, all dharmas blissfully gone like! Childish intellect grasps characteristics, world engages in non-existing dharmas!"

[6321-6326]
Also from King of Samadhi Sutra: "When this world arises, arises then ceases, abiding empty—know all dharmas thus! Middle beyond extremes, aspects perfectly clear, completely luminosity!"

[6327-6333]
From Jeweled Heap Sutra: "Non-arisen dharmas not-ceased, nature thus completely clear! No objective-reference, no characteristics, no name, no definition—example and expression also exhausted!"

Do you see? All these sutras are pointing to the same truth—dharmas do not arise! You search for arising, but nothing ever arose. You fear ceasing, but nothing ever ceases. Rest in the non-arisen!

Emaho! The ultimate truth of non-arising!

[6357-6364]
Listen here, dear practitioner! Mind, whichever of those two dawns—outward dawns, outer object; inward dawns, inner body! Fragments divided, particles portion not considered. Arisen vision-object not-existing see time, from that mind not-arisen awareness-ground grasping. Object conceptuality basis not-existing, root-free great thig-decided!

[6365-6371]
Arisen maker sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mind-arisen self, self-arisen instant's knowing substance two become. Self other-from not-arisen analyzed. Now arisen place self-arisen—arisen or thought color and shape? No color, no shape, not-existing color various, not-existing shape various! Thus appearing like mind, mind also dharmata free, dharmata also self-liberated!

Do you see? Mind is self-arisen! Not from outside, not from inside—just self-arisen! No color, no shape, yet appearing!

Emaho! The self-arisen nature of mind!
