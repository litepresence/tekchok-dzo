In the body, channels abide. In the channels, winds abide. The winds move as two: wisdom wind and karma wind. Wisdom wind ripens nirvana. Karma wind ripens samsara. This is the fork in the road where all beings stand.

[15769-15774]
This old practitioner once believed he could control the winds through force of will. He held his breath. He visualized channels. He strained until his body ached. The winds laughed at him. Control is karma wind. Recognition is wisdom wind.

[15769-15774]
Three words. Wisdom wind. Karma wind. Both arise from the same ground. The distinction is recognition, not substance. Like one river dividing into two streams—one flowing to the ocean of liberation, one to the ocean of confusion. The water is the same.

[15775-15777]
Objections arise. Answers follow. This is the play of mind investigating mind. But the winds do not need justification. They blow where they blow. Recognition turns karma wind into wisdom wind. Non-recognition turns wisdom wind into karma wind.

[15769-15777]
Therefore. Thus. We establish the distinction not to divide but to clarify. The path is recognition. The result is liberation. Rest in that recognition. The winds settle. Samsara and nirvana are seen as the wind's play.

[15777]
Cut through. The winds have never moved. The mover is the movement. Recognize this. Rest.

[15778-15785]
Voice 20 proclaims: The winds are not entities traveling through channels like vehicles on roads. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness appearing as energy. When recognized, even the heaviest karma wind becomes light as wisdom wind.

[15780-15788]
This old hermit once felt his winds raging like a storm. Thoughts churned, emotions swirled, restlessness consumed him. Then he remembered: the storm is not separate from the sky. The winds are not separate from awareness. Resting in that, the storm became a dance.

[15785-15792]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: The distinction between wisdom and karma wind is crucial, yet they are not different substances. Like one coin with two faces—you cannot have one without the other. Yet they lead to different results.

[15790-15798]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The winds that move through your body right now—are they wisdom or karma? The question itself is karma wind. The recognition that asks is wisdom wind. This is the fork in every moment.

[15795-15805]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who claim their winds are pure while others' are impure! Those who boast of clear channels and balanced winds! They mistake the sign for the destination. The channel is not the flow. The flow is not the ocean.

[15800-15810]
Between effort and surrender, the vast middle way opens. You cannot force the winds to become wisdom. You cannot suppress the karma winds. But you can recognize their nature, and in that recognition, they self-liberate. Like ice melting in warm water—no force needed.

[15805-15815]
This old practitioner spent years practicing wind techniques. He counted breaths, held retentions, visualized channels filling with light. All helpful, yet all pointing to something simpler: the winds are mind's movement. Know the mind, and the winds follow.

[15810-15820]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The winds—wisdom and karma—are the great teaching of interdependence. No wind without channels. No channels without body. No body without mind. No mind without recognition. Trace them back to their source.

[15815-15825]
Voice 20 proclaims: In the end, there are no winds. There is no channel. There is no body. There is only awareness playing at being these things. This is the final teaching—not nihilism, but freedom. Play without bondage. Dance without attachment.

[15820-15830]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't be afraid of your winds. Don't worship them. Don't suppress them. Don't indulge them. Just recognize them as mind's display, and they become the path itself. Every breath becomes instruction. Every movement becomes teaching.

[15825-15835]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The winds you feel now—warm, cool, moving, still—are wisdom's own breath. The breath you take now—in, out, pause—is karma's last dance. In the space between, recognition waits. Rest there.
