[1424-1428]
The hot hells. Reviving first: fifty human years equal one day for the Four Great Kings. Twelve months, one year. Five hundred years equal one day in Reviving Hell. Its own years: five hundred. The mathematics are terrifying not because they are cruel but because they are exact. Cause and effect without mercy, without malice.

[1429-1433]
Kālakāñja: one thousand years of Thirty-Three Gods equal one day. Saṃghāta: two thousand of Tuṣita. Raurava: four thousand of Nirmanarati. Mahāraurava: eight thousand of Paranirmitavaśavartin. Mahātāpana: half an intermediate age. Avīci: one intermediate age. The progression is not arbitrary. Each realm corresponds to the intensity of the anger that created it.

[1434-1438]
Eight cold hells. Arbuda, Arbudanirbheda, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Utpala-like, Padma-like, Mahāpadma-like splitting. The calculation: Kosala's cart filled with sesame, one grain removed each hundred human years. When the cart is empty, Arbuda's life ends. The remaining twenty times longer. This is not exaggeration. This is the scale of what we create with our rage.

[1439-1443]
Pretas: human years one hundred equal one day. Five hundred of their own years. Animals: indefinite. Some nagas endure intermediate ages. Some bees exist only instants. The variety reflects the complexity of grasping. What you cannot release, you become. The form matches the fixation.

[1444-1448]
From first eon forming until one being experiences Avīci's suffering—this is the forming eon. Three thousand worlds simultaneously formed: four continents, Meru, Brahma's realm. One thousand foremost worlds. One thousand intermediate. One thousand great. Ten million times a hundred Merus dwell here.

[1449-1453]
These forms endure twenty intermediate eons. Twenty abiding. Three manners of change: decrease for one, increase and decrease for eighteen, increase for one. Life measure from immeasurable to eighty thousand, decreasing by two hundred each time. Then from eighty thousand to ten, decreasing by one hundred. This is not history. This is the rhythm of becoming.

[1454-1462]
The formed eon. The abiding eon. The empty eon. Each twenty intermediate ages. The structure repeats at every scale. What forms the world forms the mind. What destroys the world destroys the mind. The hells are not places. They are the experience of cause meeting effect without cushion, without delay.

[1463-1470]
An old practitioner once asked his teacher: "Why describe the hells in such detail?" The teacher replied: "So you will understand the precision of cause and effect. Not to frighten you—to wake you. The sesame cart is not a threat. It is a measure. How many grains of anger have you accumulated?"

[1471-1480]
Three words that liberate from all hells: recognition itself. The hells are not punishments imposed from outside. They are the natural result of unrecognized mind. When recognition dawns, the fire becomes wisdom-heat. The ice becomes clarity. The suffering becomes the path.

[1481-1490]
Therefore. Thus. The hell realms are not foreign territories. They are the extreme states of our own mind when left unrecognized. The hot hells are anger without release. The cold hells are hatred frozen into isolation. Both are self-created. Both are self-liberated.

[1491-1500]
CUT THROUGH NOW. Do not wait to understand all eighteen hells. Do not wait to calculate the sesame grains. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. The hell you fear is already present in your anger. The liberation you seek is already present in your recognition.

[1501-1510]
This old fool has contemplated these hells for decades. He has visualized them. He has feared them. Now he sees: they are mirrors showing him his own mind. The terrifying precision is actually compassion—showing exactly how mind creates its own experience.

[1511-1520]
Between the hot hells and the cold hells, there is no hierarchy. Both are extreme. Both are unnecessary. The practitioner who recognizes this stops creating them. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the hells.

[1521-1522]
Three words: all self-liberated. Enough.
