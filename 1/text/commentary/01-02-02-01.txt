[1424-1428]
The hot hells. Reviving first: fifty human years equal one day for the Four Great Kings. Twelve months, one year. Five hundred years equal one day in Reviving Hell. Its own years: five hundred. The mathematics are terrifying not because they are cruel but because they are exact. Cause and effect without mercy, without malice.

[1429-1433]
Kālakāñja: one thousand years of Thirty-Three Gods equal one day. Saṃghāta: two thousand of Tuṣita. Raurava: four thousand of Nirmanarati. Mahāraurava: eight thousand of Paranirmitavaśavartin. Mahātāpana: half an intermediate age. Avīci: one intermediate age. The progression is not arbitrary. Each realm corresponds to the intensity of the anger that created it.

[1434-1438]
Eight cold hells. Arbuda, Arbudanirbheda, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Utpala-like, Padma-like, Mahāpadma-like splitting. The calculation: Kosala's cart filled with sesame, one grain removed each hundred human years. When the cart is empty, Arbuda's life ends. The remaining twenty times longer. This is not exaggeration. This is the scale of what we create with our rage.

[1439-1443]
Pretas: human years one hundred equal one day. Five hundred of their own years. Animals: indefinite. Some nagas endure intermediate ages. Some bees exist only instants. The variety reflects the complexity of grasping. What you cannot release, you become. The form matches the fixation.

[1444-1448]
From first eon forming until one being experiences Avīci's suffering—this is the forming eon. Three thousand worlds simultaneously formed: four continents, Meru, Brahma's realm. One thousand foremost worlds. One thousand intermediate. One thousand great. Ten million times a hundred Merus dwell here.

[1449-1453]
These forms endure twenty intermediate eons. Twenty abiding. Three manners of change: decrease for one, increase and decrease for eighteen, increase for one. Life measure from immeasurable to eighty thousand, decreasing by two hundred each time. Then from eighty thousand to ten, decreasing by one hundred. This is not history. This is the rhythm of becoming.

[1454-1462]
The formed eon. The abiding eon. The empty eon. Each twenty intermediate ages.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. The structure repeats at every scale. What forms the world forms the mind.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. What destroys the world destroys the mind. The hells are not places. They are the experience of cause meeting effect without cushion, without delay.

[1463-1470]
An old practitioner once asked his teacher: "Why describe the hells in such detail?" The teacher replied: "So you will understand the precision of cause and effect. Not to frighten you—to wake you. The sesame cart is not a threat. It is a measure. How many grains of anger have you accumulated?"

[1471-1480]
See your nature. Rest. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[1481-1490]
The framework reveals. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[1491-1500]
Break through. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[1501-1510]
A practitioner. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[1511-1520]
Between the hot hells and the cold hells, there is no hierarchy. Both are extreme. Both are unnecessary. The practitioner who recognizes this stops creating them. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the hells.

[1521-1522]
See what is.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
