[1424-1432]
The hot hells teach us about time's cruelty. You think your worst day was long? Try living where fifty of our years makes just one morning. The Yāma hell beings wake to suffering that would break us in an instant, yet they endure it for centuries of their own time. Each hell doubles the agony—like compound interest on a debt you never agreed to. I once sat through a three-day retreat and thought myself patient. These beings make my "patience" look like the tantrum of a child.

[1433-1438]
The cold hells are worse in their silence. No flames to distract you, just ice that creeps through skin and splits you open like a frozen seed pod. The Blistering hell beings develop sores that burst and freeze again. By the time you reach Split-Like-Lotus, your body cracks into eight, sixteen, sixty-four pieces—and still you do not die. The lifespan is measured by emptying a basket of sesame seeds, one every century. I have watched ants carry crumbs with more urgency than we approach liberation.

[1439-1443]
The progression from bubble to chattering teeth to lotus-splitting—it mirrors how suffering creeps up on us. First discomfort, then pain, then the cracking open of everything you thought you were. The twentieth cold hell multiplies the first by twenty. Do the math yourself. It is not meant to comfort you.

[1444-1446]
Pretas live five hundred years where one of our centuries equals a single day. They are hungry ghosts not because they lack food, but because they cannot digest what they find. Their throats are thin as needles, their bellies vast as mountains. I have met pretas in human form—those who accumulate wealth they cannot enjoy, who hunger but never feast. Animal lifespans vary, though the great nagas may live an intermediate eon. Do not envy them. Time is not the measure of a good life.

[1447-1450]
Now we come to the architecture of worlds. One thousand worlds with their four continents and Mount Meru make the first thousand. Stack a thousand of those, you get the second thousand. Stack a thousand more, you have the great three-thousand-fold world-system. One hundred billion Merus. Try to picture it and your mind bounces back like an arrow from stone. This is the stage for our endless wandering.

[1451-1453]
The formation eon itself lasts twenty intermediate eons. We speak of these numbers casually—eons, billions, three-thousand-fold—but do you feel them in your bones? When I say one hundred billion worlds, I mean more stars than you will ever see, more suffering than you can imagine, more chances to wake up than you have already wasted.
