Some hermit in a yak hair tent once collected all the teachings—every vehicle, every path, every instruction. His tent was overflowing with texts. One winter morning the roof collapsed under the weight. As he dug himself out from the snow and pages, he started laughing. "All this weight," he said, "and the sky weighs nothing." This old practitioner understood then: the teachings are pointers, not possessions. Now Longchenpa cuts to the chase. You've been studying all these vehicles—the eight, the ten, the hundred—but here's the point: none of it matters if you're still grasping at causes and effects.

[3809-3812]
When mind is free from the sign of causality, when even the object of desire is seen as non-dual—there's your answer. No need to add another path on top of the path. The eight vehicles and their progressions? They're like learning more words for emptiness when you could've just rested in silence. Listen to this: the great perfection isn't something you accomplish. It's already complete. Self-arisen, self-manifesting, directionless—it doesn't need your effort. Everything appears, yet nothing is rejected. The basis of all phenomena? It's not somewhere else. Look—whatever you meet, that is it.

[3813-3818]
Not beyond, not beneath. This yogi once spent ten years searching for Dzogchen in distant lands. Returned home to find it in his own breath. Longchenpa says even in India, dharmata shows up in ten thousand forms. The view isn't hidden in temples. It's not hidden at all. This old practitioner walks through the marketplace and sees Dzogchen in every transaction, every argument, every smile. The woman selling butter—Dzogchen. The child crying for his mother—Dzogchen. Don't look for special experiences. Ordinary is the most extraordinary.

[3819-3822]
Here's where it gets practical. When appearance and mind are no longer separate—when you stop trying to make mind into something different from appearance—then the rays of awareness shine naturally. Not because you made them shine. They were always shining. The obstacle was your insistence that there was an obstacle to remove. This yogi spent five years trying to remove obstacles. Finally saw: the remover was the obstacle. Liberation isn't fixing something broken. It's seeing that what you called "samsara" was never separate from the dharmata to begin with.

[3819-3822]
Like searching for water while swimming in the ocean. Like looking for space inside a room. This old practitioner spent decades seeking liberation. The seeking was the liberation. The seeking was the bondage. Both. Neither. Now Longchenpa gives you the dzogchen shortcuts: view beyond existence and non-existence, meditation without acceptance or rejection, conduct that doesn't cling to purity or impurity, result that doesn't grasp at attainment. These aren't four separate things. They're one taste. When you see your own face clearly—no helper, no helpee, no one doing the seeing—then bliss and suffering taste the same.

[3823-3837]
Why? Because the one who would taste is gone. Threefold division gathered, but these are just ways of pointing to what's already whole. This old practitioner once tried to practice view, meditation, conduct, and result as separate things. By noon he was exhausted. His teacher said: "Practice one, and the rest follow. Practice none, and all are complete." Don't make these into a new practice. Don't add another technique to your collection. The instruction is that there is no instruction—only the recognition of what's already present, like recognizing your own reflection in a mirror.

[3809-3812]
This hermit returns to the tent that collapsed. The teachings had become a burden because he made them into possessions. "My knowledge." "My practice." "My progress." The collapse was liberation. The snow was teaching. The cold was warmth. Everything reversed. Everything stayed the same. This is Dzogchen. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. Just—the way things are, seen clearly. The great perfection is perfect as it is. It doesn't need your improvement. It doesn't need your understanding. It just is. And you are it. Already. Always.

[3813-3818]
Self-arisen, self-manifesting, directionless. These words describe what cannot be described. The nature of mind doesn't need your effort to be what it is. It's already complete. Already perfect. Your practice doesn't improve it. Your lack of practice doesn't diminish it. This is hard to accept! We want to be the ones who achieve, who accomplish, who become. But there's no one to become. No one to achieve. Just—this. Whatever this is. The nature of mind. Clear and empty. Luminous and free.

[3819-3822]
Appearance and mind non-dual. This is the key insight. Not that mind creates appearance. Not that appearance creates mind. They're not two things in relationship. They're one display with two names. Like a mirror and its reflections. You can't separate them. You can't have one without the other. But don't make them into a unity either! Non-dual means not two, not one. Beyond both. This is the Dzogchen view. This is Atiyoga. This is the great perfection. Simple. Direct. Obvious, once seen. Invisible, until seen.

[3823-3837]
View, meditation, conduct, result—four aspects of the path. But not sequential. Not separate. View is meditation. Meditation is conduct. Conduct is result. They're four names for one thing: recognition. Recognition of your true nature. Recognition that you've never been separate from the dharmakaya. Recognition that samsara and nirvana are one taste. This is Dzogchen. This is the Atiyoga path. Don't make it complicated. Don't add steps. Just recognize. Just rest. Just be.

[3809-3837]
This practitioner returns to the collapsed tent one more time. The weight of the teachings. The lightness of the sky. This is the teaching of Dzogchen. Don't accumulate. Don't grasp. Don't make the teachings into a burden. They're meant to liberate, not to bind. Use them. Then let them go. Like a bird using a nest. The nest is useful. But the bird doesn't stay in the nest. The bird flies. You too—use the teachings, then fly. Fly in the sky of your own mind. The sky that has no limits. The sky that was never born. The sky that never dies.

[3813-3818]
Longchenpa's final instruction: ordinary mind is the way. Don't look for something special. Don't seek extraordinary experiences. The ordinary is the most extraordinary. The mundane is the most sacred. The confused mind, right here, is the awakened mind. Just see it clearly. Just recognize what it is. Not something else. Not somewhere else. Right here. Right now. In the midst of your confusion. In the midst of your suffering. Especially there. That's where the jewel is hidden. That's where the recognition happens.

Emaho! Dzogchen—already complete, already perfect. Stop trying to complete what was never incomplete. Stop trying to perfect what was never imperfect. Just this. Just here. Just now. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the fruition. All three are one. All three are empty. All three are perfectly complete. Emaho!
