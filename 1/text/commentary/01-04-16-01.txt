Now Longchenpa cuts to the chase. You've been studying all these vehicles—the eight, the ten, the hundred—but here's the point: none of it matters if you're still grasping at causes and effects. When mind is free from the sign of causality, when even the object of desire is seen as non-dual—there's your answer. No need to add another path on top of the path. The eight vehicles and their progressions? They're like learning more words for emptiness when you could've just rested in silence.

Listen to this: the great perfection isn't something you accomplish. It's already complete. Self-arisen, self-manifesting, directionless—it doesn't need your effort. Everything appears, yet nothing is rejected. The basis of all phenomena? It's not somewhere else. Look—whatever you meet, that is it. Not beyond, not beneath. Longchenpa says even in India, dharmatā shows up in ten thousand forms. The view isn't hidden in temples.

[3819-3822]
Here's where it gets practical. When appearance and mind are no longer separate—when you stop trying to make mind into something different from appearance—then the rays of awareness shine naturally. Not because you made them shine. They were always shining. The obstacle was your insistence that there was an obstacle to remove. Liberation isn't fixing something broken. It's seeing that what you called "samsara" was never separate from the dharmatā to begin with.

[3823-3837]
Now Longchenpa gives you the dzogchen shortcuts: view beyond existence and non-existence, meditation without acceptance or rejection, conduct that doesn't cling to purity or impurity, result that doesn't grasp at attainment. These aren't four separate things. They're one taste. When you see your own face clearly—no helper, no helpee, no one doing the seeing—then bliss and suffering taste the same. Why? Because the one who would taste is gone. Threefold division gathered, but these are just ways of pointing to what's already whole.

Don't make these into a new practice. Don't add another technique to your collection. The instruction is that there is no instruction—only the recognition of what's already present, like recognizing your own reflection in a mirror.
