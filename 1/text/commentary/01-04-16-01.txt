Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to explain the White Space divisions using milk. "Ocean Space is like the milk in the bucket—vast, deep, containing everything. Sky Space is like the cream that rises—pure, light, naturally separating." This old practitioner asked: "Where's the butter?" The hermit stared at his bucket for three days. Finally he churned it. "The butter," he said, "is what happens when you stop analyzing and start practicing." This is Dzogchen. Not about understanding divisions. About direct experience. Ocean Space: essence, permanence-extreme self-liberated, so without action, liberation liberating itself; various non-dual. The ocean doesn't try to be vast. It just is. The space doesn't try to be spacious. It just is. This is the model for practice. Don't try. Just be.

Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space—two divisions. What's the difference? This hermit asked his teacher. She said: "Great is what you think you are. Small is what you actually are. Both are ocean." He didn't understand. Spent five years trying to understand. Finally gave up. The giving up was the understanding. Great Ocean Space: mind self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated, so looking at emptiness is completely pure. Seeing appearance is nature of dharmata, so primordially inexpressible. Yes and Great Existence's wheel abiding single—empty, so empty doesn't establish anywhere. This is the vast view. The panoramic view. The view that includes everything and transcends everything.

[3786-3795]
Small Ocean Space: looking-pure self-liberated, so mind without stain; abiding place completely pure, so conditions primordially inexpressible. This is the intimate view. The close-up view. The view that sees the particular while knowing the universal. This hermit prefers the small ocean. More manageable. Less overwhelming. But both are the same ocean. Both are the same space. The divisions are for teaching, not for reality. Don't get stuck on great or small. Don't prefer vast or intimate. Both are true. Both are necessary. Both are empty.

[3796-3805]
Sky Space: unconstructed in dharmata, so mind itself self-liberated. Sun and Moon Space, Jewel White Space. Two types, two aspects, two ways of looking at the same sky. Sun and Moon—day and night, clarity and emptiness, appearance and nature. The sun illuminates. The moon reflects. Both are light. Both are necessary. Jewel White Space—qualities, richness, complete perfection. The jewel that fulfills all wishes. The space that contains all possibilities. This hermit keeps a clear crystal in his tent. Looks through it at the sky. Sees how the crystal contains the sky. How the sky contains the crystal. How neither contains the other. How both are empty.

[3806-3815]
Sun Space: essence completely pure emptiness, nature unborn primordially liberated. Moon Space: qualities completely perfected, so causes and conditions pure, mind without action, dharmata spontaneously accomplished, causes and conditions pure. This is getting technical. This old practitioner doesn't remember all the terms. But he remembers the feeling. The feeling of the sun rising on a clear morning. The feeling of the moon rising on a still night. Both peaceful. Both illuminating. Both empty of inherent existence. The sun doesn't think "I am illuminating." The moon doesn't think "I am reflecting." They just do. This is the model.

This practitioner returns to the milk analogy. The hermit churned for three days. Finally butter appeared. "This is Dzogchen," he said. "Not the milk, not the cream, not the churning. The butter that was always there, just separated out." This old practitioner likes this. The butter is the recognition. The milk is the confused state. The churning is the practice. But the butter was always there. Always potential. Just needed the conditions to manifest. The practice doesn't create the recognition. It reveals what was always present. This is Anuyoga. This is the completion stage. This is the path of directness.

[3826-3835]
Jewel White Space: qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions pure. The jewel represents the complete perfection of all qualities. Not that you acquire qualities. But that you recognize the qualities already present. Wisdom, compassion, power—all are already there. Just obscured by confusion. Like the sun obscured by clouds. The clouds don't harm the sun. The sun doesn't wait for the clouds to clear. It's always shining. This is the view. This is the meditation. This is the conduct. Recognize what's already present. Rest in what's already true. Act from what's already complete.

[3836-3845]
This hermit returns to the beginning. White Space divisions. Ocean and Sky. Great and Small. Sun and Moon. Jewel. All pointing to the same. All empty of inherent existence. All useful as pointers. All useless as possessions. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the fruition. Not something to achieve. Something to recognize. Not somewhere to go. Somewhere to be. This is Dzogchen. This is the great perfection. This is your own nature, clearly seen. Emaho!
