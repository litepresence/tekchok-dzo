Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. If the basis is singular like the variety of appearances, the fault emerges immediately: a singular ground arising outwardly as manifold variety. This violates the very definition of singularity. A stone cannot become water; a seed cannot become sky. Yet appearances do manifest as variety. Thus the basis cannot be strictly singular—it is singular in essence, manifold in display, like the sun single in nature yet casting countless reflections.

[10722-10723]
This old practitioner remembers the debates in the high mountain valleys. Scholars would argue for days: is the basis one or many? Like arguing whether the ocean is one or many drops. The wise grandmother breaks her teacup and laughs—neither one nor many, just broken ceramic returning to earth. The basis manifests variety without becoming multiple, remains singular without being one.

[10722-10723]
Between one and many, the vast middle way opens like a lotus at dawn. The single basis does not fragment into plurality like a mirror shattering. The manifold appearances do not coalesce into singularity like rivers merging into sea. Each appearance is complete, each contains the whole, yet none are separate from the basis. This is the great mystery of spontaneous presence within primordial purity.

[10723-10726]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: To assert multiplicity as the basis brings its own ruin! If consciousness is momentary, the basis becomes momentary—arising and ceasing like lightning flashes. If consciousness holds many thoughts, the basis fragments into a thousand shards. If consciousness is afflicted by conditions, the basis becomes stained and impure. This is the trap of identifying basis with conditioned mind!

[10724-10726]
CUT THROUGH NOW! Do not confuse the mirror with the reflections! The basis is not consciousness. Consciousness is a wave on the ocean. The basis is the ocean itself, not moved by any wave. The clear sky is not the clouds that pass through it. The ocean depths are not disturbed by surface waves. Those who equate basis with consciousness build their temple on quicksand.

[10726-10729]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals: if multiplicity is held as the basis, three fatal consequences follow. The basis becomes external and internal—divided against itself. The basis becomes grasper and grasped—caught in its own trap. The basis becomes the six collections of consciousness—fragmented and partial. How can the ground of all be divided? How can the source be caught in its own stream?

[10727-10729]
This old hermit has seen ants trying to carry the mountain. Those who claim the basis is many are like those who see the forest but miss the single earth from which all trees grow. The six consciousnesses are waves on the ocean of rigpa—distinct in appearance, one in essence. To mistake the waves for the ocean itself is the great error of philosophers.

[10729-10734]
The basis cannot be held as a single expanse because it is an assembly of many—this is the final contradiction of the seventh position. From the Six Expanses tantra, the Teacher spoke scattered above, his words like autumn leaves drifting on the wind. This too, because it does not accord with any side, whose essence is that appearance.

[10733-10741]
Between scattered and gathered, the vast middle way opens like space itself. The seven positions are seven attempts to capture the sky in a net. The result different, yet that meaning similar—each position finds its own destruction. Because deterioration comes through many sounds, the words themselves become obstacles. Are not these knowable dharmas? What was spoken is just like that.

[10742-10746]
Voice 20 proclaims: The primordial wisdom of self-arisen awareness, being free from the extremes of existence and non-existence, is not established merely as primordial wisdom! One holds that from the aspect of the great bindu free from elaborations, it is not established anywhere. But this too falls into error!

[10746-10750]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis cuts like a sword. If primordial wisdom is not established as anything, not existing merely as primordial wisdom, being pure from the beginning without anything to place anywhere—if there were nothing, this contradicts being the expanse from which samsara and nirvana arise. If primordial wisdom does not exist, liberation of Buddhas and sentient beings does not exist. The subtle five lights provide the cause for basis-appearances to arise. Without them, the non-realized mind of delusion cannot even manifest.

[10750-10754]
From the Six Expanses: Because the essence itself is primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted. This is similar to the previous six bases—all positions dissolve in the light of recognition.

[10755-10756]
Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own system. This is the path of Great Perfection, beyond the seven extremes. Not one, not many, not both, not neither—the basis transcends all logical categories while remaining the foundation of all appearance.
