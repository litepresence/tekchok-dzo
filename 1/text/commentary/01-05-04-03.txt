An old practitioner once asked: "Who is defeated in this victory?" The answer came like lightning: no one. There was never any battle. The thousand suns were never at war. The illumination was never opposed. All was awareness, playing at victory and defeat.

[6511-6520]
Thus. We proceed...

[6521-6530]
Cut!

[6531-6540]
A practitioner...
