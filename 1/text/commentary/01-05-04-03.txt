Fourth: thousand suns' Victorious One. Light upon light, each sun a complete awakening, each awakening illuminating countless fields. The Victorious One is not one who conquers. The Victorious One is one who has seen there was never a battle. The thousand suns rise in the sky of a single mind. They do not compete. They complete each other.

[6422-6430]
An old practitioner once tried to gaze at these thousand suns. He was blinded by the first. In that blindness, he understood: the suns are not for looking at. They are for recognizing as one's own nature. The Victorious One does not illuminate outside. The Victorious One recognizes illumination as self.

[6431-6440]
Three words that conquer all: recognition itself. The battle was never fought. The victory was never won. The Victorious One is victorious over the illusion of conflict. The thousand suns are not many lights. They are one awareness displaying as illumination.

[6441-6450]
Therefore. Thus. The thousand suns teach what the previous Buddhas taught: light is not separate from awareness. The illumination and the illuminated are not separate. The awakening is the recognition of non-duality.

[6451-6460]
Between the thousand suns and the recognition that transcends all light, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the illumination. Not grasping it. The light points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This old practitioner has sought light in many places—celestial and human. He has chased illumination. Now he sees: the chasing was the obstacle. The light was always present. Recognition is the only illumination needed. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6471-6480]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The suns have already set. The battle was never fought. The victory is already won. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. Do not wait for the thousand suns to rise. Recognize the light NOW.

[6481-6490]
Therefore. Thus. The fourth Buddha completes his teaching. The suns have been counted. The victory has been declared. The path continues or nowhere at all. Both are the same. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the illumination.

[6491-6500]
Three words that complete all victories: awareness itself. The battle is awareness. The victory is awareness. The Victorious One is awareness. The defeated is awareness. The recognition is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who is defeated in this victory?" The answer came like lightning: no one. There was never any battle. The thousand suns were never at war. The illumination was never opposed. All was awareness, playing at victory and defeat.

[6511-6520]
Therefore. Thus. The fourth Buddha is complete. The suns have set and risen countless times. The victories have been celebrated. The recognition has dawned. All complete, yet nothing was ever incomplete. Rest in that completion.

[6521-6530]
CUT THROUGH. The thousand suns are not celestial bodies. They are moments of recognition. The Victorious One is not a being. He is awareness knowing itself. The battle was never external. Cut through NOW. Rest in awareness.

[6531-6540]
This old practitioner has seen many victories—celestial and human. He has celebrated and mourned. Now he rests where there is no winning, no losing—only awareness displaying as all of it. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[Final] Three words complete.
