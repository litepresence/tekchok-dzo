[635-640]
Victory banners and parasols in the south-east direction—sounds pleasant, doesn't it? Like a festival day at the monastery. But this old hermit's mind drifts to the frozen butter lamp on my altar, the one that sputters when the wind finds a hole in the yak hair tent. Thal-ba's sound keeps resounding, but my ears are half-closed with sleep. The flowers and fragrances descend, and I sniff the air like a hungry dog, missing the point entirely. Recognition is not found in the description.

[641-650]
The wind of Thal-ba moving in intermediate space—this wind moves whether I notice it or not. Like the thief who entered my empty hut last winter. I had nothing worth taking, so he left disappointed. The sounds arising from this wind, the three gateways of the five-possessing one—my own sense doors are so clogged with dullness I can barely hear the teaching in my own breath. The banner of practice hangs limp today.

[651-660]
Thirteen stacked at the summit, Jewel Thal-ba adorned with sun rays. Sounds magnificent. Meanwhile my meditation cushion has a hole in it, and my knees ache from sitting. The qualities of desire mentioned here—this old fool still grasps at comfort, at warmth, at the idea that practice should feel a certain way. The lotus eyes of lda-ldi see clearly, but my eyes are clouded with wondering what's for lunch.

[661-672]
West-north interval, Taming Thal-ba, offering complete with goddesses. I read this and think of offerings, of ritual, of how I should be more devoted. But devotion cannot be manufactured. Like trying to push a river uphill. The goddesses here are not external beings to propitiate—they are the playful display of my own mind, offering themselves constantly while I sit here doubting everything. The doubt itself is an offering I keep rejecting.

[673-685]
Below nine worlds, Dung-ldan Thal-ba, faith-protecting smell, blazing light. The dung-ldan, possessing the quality of dung—how appropriate for this practitioner whose mind produces nothing but manure most days. Faith-protecting smell? My faith stinks sometimes, weak as watered tea. The blazing light—sometimes I glimpse it, then it's gone, like trying to hold water in a fist. Six worlds, Star Thal-ba—six ways to wander, and I know them all intimately.

[686-695]
Thus from immeasurable fields, this Saha's sequence. Our world of endurance, explained as arising from the same source as pure lands. This is not comfortable news. I would prefer the pure lands to be elsewhere, somewhere to escape to. But Saha is right here, in this aching back, in this wandering mind, in this hermit hut that leaks when it rains. The external elements from wind, water, earth—look at your own body. Same elements, same confusion, same potential.

[696-710]
Continents, Mount Meru, sun and moon, three realms. My mind builds these structures constantly—this is good, that is bad, this is spiritual, that is mundane. Architect of samsara, that's me. The fortunate aeon, first humans with form and beauty marks, own-light radiance—sounds like a memory of something I never actually had. Eighty thousand years without male and female faculties? I can barely manage an hour without thinking about such things. The gradual decline began with eating earth-oil, then rice. I understand this. First the subtle taste of practice, then coarser and coarser food until I'm munching on concepts, stuffed with ideas, starving for recognition.

[711-725]
World-formation: wind supporting water, water supporting earth. The text describes this cosmologically, but look at your own mind. What supports what in there? Does anxiety support planning? Does planning support more anxiety? The triangle of space, the syllable E—I sit here searching for the world's origin in ancient texts while my own thoughts arise without trace, without beginning, without the syllable E or any other letter. Wind, water, earth, fire, sky—my body knows these intimately. The fire of irritation when interrupted. The water of tears when moved. The earth of stubbornness. The wind of changeable mood. The sky of... what? Something that doesn't change. Something watching the elements play.

[726-740]
Twenty intermediate eons passed, the text says. How long is an eon? Long enough for this hermit to have fallen asleep sitting up more times than countable. Elements arising from clear space—this happens every morning when I wake. First clear space, then elements of thought gather like clouds, then the world appears solid again. The container-world and essence-beings—are they two? In my experience, they seem separate. The world out there, me in here. But when I look for the boundary, where is it? Like looking for the place where water ends and wave begins.

[741-756]
The forming wind, the gathering water, the separating, holding, ripening, opening. Longchenpa lists the functions of elements, and I think of my meditation. Forming—my thoughts form worlds. Gathering—attention collects experience. Separating—I divide self from other constantly. Holding—I cling to what I like. Ripening—habits mature into character. Opening—occasionally, briefly, mind opens to its own nature. Then closes again, like a startled bird.

[757-770]
Waves from the ocean, atoms falling like snow. Beautiful description. Meanwhile my cushion is hard and my legs are numb. Sky atoms gathering, gathering—my concepts gathering into a self, into a world, into a solid reality that feels so real until it doesn't. The text describes goddesses holding vases, nagas supporting from below. Where are these in my experience? The goddesses are the subtle forces that shape perception. The nagas are the deep unconscious patterns holding everything up. I don't see them directly, but I see their effects. Like seeing smoke and knowing fire.

[771-780]
Seven mountains, seven lakes, the four continents, the islands. Such elaborate geography. But this geography is my own mind's landscape. The mountains are obstacles, the lakes are depth of meditation, the continents are different types of beings I could become. Jambudvipa, where we are—this human realm with its mixture of suffering and opportunity. Not hell, not heaven, but the place where practice is possible. Look around at your own mind. Is it not precisely this? Not pure, not impure, but workable. The mirror moment: examine your own mind. What is it right now? Not what you think it should be. Not what it was yesterday. What is it actually, this moment, before you name it?

[781-790]
Yoke-holder, Plow-arrow-holder, Acacia-possessing—these mountain names sound strange to modern ears. But strip away the exotic language and what remains? The yoke I place on myself every morning when I wake up believing I am this person, with these problems, in this hut. The plow that breaks up whatever peace I manage to find, the arrows I shoot at myself when I compare my practice to imagined others. The acacia—thorny, tough, growing where nothing else will. Like my confusion, persistent as weeds.

[791-800]
The eight great nagas in their play-lakes. Joyful, Near-joyful, Horse-basis—names that sound almost playful. But these nagas control the rains, the text says. In my experience, they control the weather of my moods. Sometimes joyful, sometimes near-joyful but not quite, sometimes based on horse-like restlessness. The rains they send are the blessings and obstacles of practice. Too much rain and I drown in emotion. Too little and everything dries up. I am learning to neither praise nor blame the nagas. They are just doing what nagas do.

[801-806]
So much geography, so many measurements, hundreds of thousands of leagues. This old hermit has trouble walking to the stream for water. The cosmic distances described here are meant to stretch the mind beyond its limits. When I try to imagine such vastness, my mind gives up—and in that giving up, something relaxes. The frozen butter lamp finally catches. The thief finds nothing to steal because there is no one home. The yak hair tent keeps out enough wind to keep me alive, not enough to keep me comfortable. This is the practice. This is the recognition. Not somewhere else, not in some pure land, but right here in the cramped hut of this body, this mind, this very moment.

[807-820]
The text speaks of Mount Meru rising like butter from churned milk, layers upon layers, vajra tier and lotus tier and jewel light tier. I have never seen Mount Meru, but I have watched cream rise to the top of milk pail. Same principle. The tiers stack in my body as I sit—coarse at the base, more refined as attention rises. Sometimes I feel the jewel light at the crown, bright and weightless. Other times just the heavy earth of the base, dull and stuck. Both are Meru. Both are valid. The mountain doesn't judge which tier I happen to inhabit today.

[821-840]
Sun and moon, individual gods—the right and left channels, the solar and lunar energies. They rise and fall, wax and wane, just like my capacity for practice. Some days the sun dominates, active and bright. Other days the moon, receptive and cool. When they balance, there is a moment of clarity, like dawn between night and day. I used to chase these moments, try to make them stay. Now I watch them come and go like weather. The sun doesn't ask permission to set. The moon doesn't apologize for waning. Neither should I apologize for the fluctuations of this mind.

[841-850]
The four great kings holding the earth from below—Dhrtarastra, Virudhaka, Virupaksa, Vaisravana. Guardians of direction, guardians of practice. In my experience, they are the four postures: walking, standing, sitting, lying down. Each holds up the world in its own way. Each can be meditation if I stop fighting against it. Walking meditation—how many miles have I paced in this small hut, watching the floorboards wear smooth? Standing when the legs scream from sitting too long. Lying down when sleep is the only honest thing to do. The kings don't care about my preferences. They just hold up what needs holding.

[851-865]
Thirty-two secondary nagas, thirty-two lotus lakes. The numbers multiply until the mind gives up counting. This is the point. The complexity is not for memorization—it is for overwhelm, for pushing the intellect past its limit into surrender. When I stop trying to map this geography, when I admit I will never hold all these details in my head, something opens. The frozen butter lamp melts. The thief laughs and becomes a friend. The yak hair tent flap lifts in the wind, and I see there was never any separation between inside and outside. The thirteen Thal-ba fields, the nine worlds, the six worlds—all of it, right here, right now, in this breath, in this confusion, in this fleeting glimpse of what was never lost.
