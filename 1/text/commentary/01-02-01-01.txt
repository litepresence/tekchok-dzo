[635-640]
Three words only. Essential. Direct. Like fire.
No need for twenty-five. No need for thirteen.
The field is where you are standing.
Stop looking elsewhere.

[641-652]
The translator sits with the text at dawn, words arriving like birds from the east. Twenty-five stacked fields—he renders them into language that carries the weight but not always the color. The stacked lotus upon which these worlds appear: this is not a cosmology to be visualized but a direct pointing to the layers of your own awareness. From formless to form, from subtle to coarse—these are not places but stages of recognition.

[653-666]
The Lotus-Born stands on the Tibetan plateau, lotus-born himself, concealing treasures in rock and mind. The fields he describes are not Indian imports—they are the mountains and valleys of his new home, transformed through vision. Twenty-five stacked, each with its own gods and goddesses, its own rain and wind. He sees them simultaneously: the field of luminous clarity, the field of Brahma's drum-sound, this very Sahā world with its dust and yak dung. All are the play of the mandala. All are spontaneously accomplished.

[667-680]
Therefore we establish: the twenty-five are not sequential but simultaneous. The enumeration serves pedagogical purposes, not ontological ones. Like counting the colors of a rainbow—seven or five or ten depending on your culture—the number matters less than the recognition that light itself is uncountable. The architecture reveals the structure of perception, not the structure of reality. Reality has no structure.

[681-694]
The wanderer laughs at all this counting. Twenty-five? Fifty? A thousand? He sits in his cave and the cave is all fields. The wind through the crack is the sound of Thal-ba. The drip of water is the teaching of dependent arising. He needs no lotus throne, no stacked arrangement. Three words, three gestures. The world is complete. Your confusion is complete. Stop trying to improve it.

[695-708]
The Lion-Faced roars from beyond form. WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING IN THESE STACKED WORLDS? Each field is a prison if you think it is somewhere else. Each description is a chain if you cling to it. Cut through! The twenty-five are one. The one is zero. The zero is YOU—still searching, still counting, still hoping the next field will be better than this one. IT WILL NOT. This field is on fire. Wake up!

[709-722]
The translator returns to the text, refining his words. The stacked fields are described in the tantras with precise measurements, specific ornaments, detailed retinues. He renders them carefully, knowing that each word is a bridge between worlds. The cuckoo's call, the early dawn, the mirror without frame—these are not metaphors but instructions. Look at your own mind. See the layers. The thirteenth is not special—it is simply where you happen to be looking now.

[723-736]
The systematizer builds the framework, then dissolves it. The twenty-five stacked lotus-abiding ones are arranged with geometric precision. Below this world: Thal-ba-dbyangs. Above: progressively refined fields. Each with its own shape, its own light, its own teaching. But the architecture points beyond itself. The building is empty. The builder never existed. Walk through the door that was never closed.

[737-750]
The wanderer speaks again, from farther away now. You want to know the twenty-five fields? I will tell you. One: here. Two: here. Three through twenty-five: here. The end. Now practice.

[751-764]
The Lion-Faced's wrath softens into compassion. She sees the practitioners struggling to visualize, counting on their fingers, drawing maps in the dirt. She wants to shake them, but she also wants to hold them. The fields are real, she says more gently. They are also empty. They are also your own mind. Stop choosing between these truths. Hold all three simultaneously.

[765-780]
The translator makes his final revision. The text is complete. The twenty-five fields stand in their stacked arrangement, waiting. They have always been waiting. For whom? For you to stop looking and start seeing. The translation is finished. The transmission continues.
