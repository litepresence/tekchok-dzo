Three words only. Essential. Direct. Like fire.
No need for twenty-five. No need for thirteen.
The field is where you are standing.
Stop looking elsewhere.

[641-652]
The translator sits with the text at dawn, words arriving like birds from the east. Twenty-five stacked fields—he renders them into language that carries the weight but not always the color. The stacked lotus upon which these worlds appear: this is not a cosmology to be visualized but a direct pointing to the layers of your own awareness. From formless to form, from subtle to coarse—these are not places but stages of recognition.

[653-666]
The Lotus-Born stands on the Tibetan plateau, lotus-born himself, concealing treasures in rock and mind. The fields he describes are not Indian imports—they are the mountains and valleys of his new home, transformed through vision. Twenty-five stacked, each with its own gods and goddesses, its own rain and wind. He sees them simultaneously: the field of luminous clarity, the field of Brahma's drum-sound, this very Sahā world with its dust and yak dung. All are the play of the mandala. All are spontaneously accomplished.

[667-680]
Therefore we establish: the twenty-five are not sequential but simultaneous. The enumeration serves pedagogical purposes, not ontological ones. Like counting the colors of a rainbow—seven or five or ten depending on your culture—the number matters less than the recognition that light itself is uncountable. The architecture reveals the structure of perception, not the structure of reality. Reality has no structure.

[681-694]
The wanderer laughs at all this counting. Twenty-five? Fifty? A thousand? He sits in his cave and the cave is all fields. The wind through the crack is the sound of Thal-ba. The drip of water is the teaching of dependent arising. He needs no lotus throne, no stacked arrangement. Three words, three gestures. The world is complete. Your confusion is complete. Stop trying to improve it.

[695-708]
The Lion-Faced roars from beyond form. WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING IN THESE STACKED WORLDS? Each field is a prison if you think it is somewhere else. Each description is a chain if you cling to it. See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. The twenty-five are one. The one is zero. The zero is YOU—still searching, still counting, still hoping the next field will be better than this one. IT WILL NOT. This field is on fire. See your own nature

An old practitioner once spent a summer counting the stars visible from a high mountain pass. Each night he added more to his tally. By autumn he had counted thousands, yet the sky remained unchanged. He finally understood: the counting was the practice, but the recognition was the point. The twenty-five fields are like those stars—countable, yet pointing to the infinite.

[765-780]
Three words that encompass all twenty-five fields: recognition itself. The fields do not exist apart from the one who recognizes them. The one who recognizes does not exist apart from the recognition. Stop counting worlds and recognize the world-stopper. Enough.

[Final]
What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
