Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the flaw in asserting both permanence and impermanence as co-existent realities. The logician examines: if impermanent phenomena dwell merely as appearances without substantial existence, how can permanent entities claim independent status? The two positions devour each other like serpents consuming their own tails. Accept anything whatsoever and the fortress of certainty crumbles. No position withstands the scrutiny of rigpa's clear light.

This old practitioner once believed samsara could be liberated through certainty and effort. Ha! The joke is on whoever clings to positions. If accepting anything is your method, then samsara liberates itself while you chase your tail, and those already liberated spiral back into bondage. The Seven Bases debate like frogs croaking at the bottom of a well, each certain their patch of sky is the whole heaven.

[10703-10707]
CUT THROUGH NOW! Certainty is the demon that binds! The position-holder builds a prison with the stones of their own logic. Samsara without effort? Liberation that reverts? These are the nightmares of those who still believe in the solidity of views. Tear down the fortress of positions! Smash the idol of certainty!

[10706-10716]
From Klongdrukpa, the Teacher spoke: those who possess such assertions scatter themselves across ten directions. The tantra sings of projections without substance, knowable dharmas dissolving like morning mist on the mountain lake. What was spoken before remains true now—the words themselves are empty echoes in the canyon of mind.

[10706-10716]
Between certainty and doubt, the vast middle way opens like a lotus at dawn. The wise do not plant their flag on either shore. The seven positions are seven fingers pointing at the moon, but the fool clings to the finger and misses the celestial radiance. Thus spoke the tantra: these are merely directional projections, established as existing entities only through the power of deluded perception.

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Multiplicity arises! But where? In external appearance like a mirage shimmering across desert sands? In internal consciousness like reflections dancing on disturbed water? Or in the gathering of both, two snakes twisted into an impossible knot? The sixth position claims essence arises everywhere, therefore variegated appearances manifest. But essence has no everywhere—it is the everywhere without location.

[10719-10721]
The dream horse gallops across the plain of sleep, yet no hoof prints mark the waking ground. So too with multiplicity—appearing vividly, existing nowhere. To hold appearance as external is to chase the rainbow's end. To hold it as internal is to grasp one's own shadow. The gathering of both? A castle built on clouds. This old hermit laughs at those who debate the color of the wind.

[10720-10721]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The basis is not one, not many. The appearance of multiplicity is rigpa's own play, neither external object nor internal fabrication. Let go of the need to locate. The mirror reflects without claiming the reflection. This is the secret of the Seven Bases.
