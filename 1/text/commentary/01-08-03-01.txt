Accordingly. The analysis...

This wanderer...

[10703-10707]
CUT THROUGH NOW! Certainty is the demon that binds! The position-holder builds a prison with the stones of their own logic. Samsara without effort? Liberation that reverts? These are the nightmares of those who still believe in the solidity of views. Tear down the fortress of positions! Smash the idol of certainty!

[10706-10716]
From Klongdrukpa, the Teacher spoke: those who possess such assertions scatter themselves across ten directions. The tantra sings of projections without substance, knowable dharmas dissolving like morning mist on the mountain lake. What was spoken before remains true now—the words themselves are empty echoes in the canyon of mind.

[10706-10716]
Between certainty and doubt, the vast middle way opens like a lotus at dawn. The wise do not plant their flag on either shore. The seven positions are seven fingers pointing at the moon, but the fool clings to the finger and misses the celestial radiance. Thus spoke the tantra: these are merely directional projections, established as existing entities only through the power of deluded perception.

[10717-10721]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Multiplicity arises! But where? In external appearance like a mirage shimmering across desert sands? In internal consciousness like reflections dancing on disturbed water? Or in the gathering of both, two snakes twisted into an impossible knot? The sixth position claims essence arises everywhere, therefore variegated appearances manifest. But essence has no everywhere—it is the everywhere without location.

[10719-10721]
The dream horse gallops across the plain of sleep, yet no hoof prints mark the waking ground. So too with multiplicity—appearing vividly, existing nowhere. To hold appearance as external is to chase the rainbow's end. To hold it as internal is to grasp one's own shadow. The gathering of both? A castle built on clouds. This old hermit laughs at those who debate the color of the wind.

[10720-10721]
See what is.

[10722-10725]
In this manner...

[10725-10730]
This hermit...

[10730-10735]
Voice 20 proclaims: The seventh position—that the basis transcends all positions—is itself a position to be transcended! Like a thorn used to remove a thorn, then thrown away. Like a boat used to cross a river, then left on the shore. Don't carry the thorn. Don't drag the boat.

[10735-10740]
Between the seven and the eighth, the vast middle way opens. The eighth is not another position but the dissolution of positioning itself. Not emptiness as a view, but view dissolving into emptiness. Not spontaneously present as a belief, but belief spontaneously self-liberated.

[10740-10745]
This old hermit offers final teaching on the Seven Bases: They are not enemies to defeat but friends to thank. Each shows a different face of delusion, a different path to recognition. Without their refutation, the non-dual basis could not be established. They are the dark that makes light visible.

[10745-10750]
Look. It is here.

[10750-10756]
Hence. The structure...
