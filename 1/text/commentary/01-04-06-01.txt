Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me about the two truths. "Conventional truth," he said, "is like the reflection of the moon in my tea cup. You can see it, navigate by it, but don't try to put it in your pocket." This old practitioner spent three winters trying to put the moon in his pocket anyway. Got nothing but wet fingers and a good story.

[2880-2887]
The ultimate truth—that's the moon itself, which also won't fit in a pocket. Maybe pockets are the problem. This yogi once met a merchant who had pockets full of gold and was miserable. Met a beggar with empty pockets who laughed like a demon. The difference? One saw the reflection, the other saw the moon. Both are necessary. Neither is the point.

The bodhisattva path begins with lay vows or monastic vows—eight precepts, two hundred fifty vows for monks, three hundred sixty-three for nuns. This hermit tried counting them once. Lost track at forty-seven. The counting itself became the practice. The vows are not chains but wings—each one lifting you a little higher, until you realize you were already flying.

[2903-2908]
The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the path of no-more-learning—five paths like five mountain ridges. Each one seems like the top until you see the next. This practitioner once thought he'd reached the summit. Sat down to rest and saw clouds below him, mountains above. The climbing doesn't stop until you realize there was never anywhere to go.

[2909-2913]
The result: dharmakaya for oneself, form kayas for others. Knowing all that exists, knowing all that can be known. This old hermit doesn't know what he'll have for breakfast tomorrow, but he trusts the texts that say complete knowing is possible. Maybe knowing everything includes not-knowing some things. The mystery remains. Thank goodness.

[2914-2918]
Emaho! The bodhisattva vehicle—so vast, so compassionate, so long! Who has the patience for three countless eons? This practitioner once wanted enlightenment by next Tuesday. Now he sees that the wanting itself was the obstacle. The bodhisattva doesn't hurry. The bodhisattva doesn't linger. The bodhisattva just keeps walking, carrying all beings, until the walking becomes the destination.
