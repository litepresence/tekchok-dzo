[2873-2879]
—what one realizes through reasoning, through analysis, through the negation of all extremes. Examine: does something arise from itself, from other, from both, from neither? Find no satisfactory answer. Conclude: empty. This is the nominal ultimate.

But the true ultimate

[2873-2887]
The nominal ultimate is what one realizes through reasoning—through Madhyamaka analysis, through negating all extremes. Seeing that nothing arises from itself, from other, from both, or from neither. Concluding: empty. This is crucial! But it is still conceptual, still within the realm of mind. The true ultimate

[2873-2887]
It is the nature of the conventional world, seen clearly. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. They are not two separate things. Practice begins with the conventional—cultivating virtue, gathering merit, developing concentration. It matures in the ultimate—realizing emptiness, transcending all views, resting in non-dual wisdom. But even the ultimate is not a stopping point! From the ultimate, one returns to the conventional, now transformed, now the play of awakening.

[2881-2887]
—phenomena primordially transcend all elaborations. They do not need to be negated; they were never affirmative. They do not need to be emptied; they were never full. This is not something reached through reasoning. It is what remains when reasoning itself dissolves into its own ground.

So practice with both truths. Engage the conventional path—the virtues, the disciplines, the meditations

[2881-2887]
—phenomena primordially transcend all elaboration. They do not need to be negated; they were never established. They do not need to be emptied; they were never full. This is beyond reasoning, beyond concept, beyond even the notion of "ultimate." It is what remains when the mind that seeks it relaxes completely.

[2889-2902]
. But never forget that even as one practices, the ultimate truth is never separate, never elsewhere. The path itself is empty. The one who walks it cannot be found.

[2889-2961]
, and one must not see this as merely theoretical! These stages describe how one's own practice will unfold if committing to the path.

First, the four establishments of mindfulness on the small path of accumulation [2895]—mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena. This stabilizes. One learns to watch without immediately reacting. Sees the body as impermanent, feelings as unsatisfactory, mind as changing, phenomena as selfless. This is the foundation!

Then the four right abandonments on the medium path [2896]—abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen, preventing unwholesome states not yet arisen, producing wholesome states not yet arisen, maintaining wholesome states that have arisen. This energizes practice!

The four miraculous feet on the great path [2897]—desire, effort, mind, and investigation. This concentrates power. One becomes capable of sustained attention, of penetrating insight.

Then come the five faculties on the path of heat and peak [2898]—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. These are like five roots drawing up nourishment. Without faith, no effort. Without effort, no mindfulness. Without mindfulness, no concentration. Without concentration, no wisdom.

The five strengths on the path of patience and supreme dharma [2899]—the same five, but now unshakeable. One cannot be swayed by doubt, by distraction, by any obstacle.

The seven limbs of enlightenment on the path of seeing [2900]—mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These blossom when one has direct perception of emptiness.

And finally the eight aspects of the superior path on the nine grounds of meditation [2901]—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The complete integration of wisdom and conduct.

But hear this: these are not steps climbed once and for all. One cycles through them again and again, each time more deeply. And the final fruit—the All-Illumination ground, the Dharma body, the form bodies

[2889-2902]
, and one must walk these stages oneself! Whether householder or monastic, the path is open. The lay practitioner's vow or full ordination—both are suitable

[2889-2891]
. What matters is not the outer form but the inner transformation.

The ten novice disciplines, the two hundred fifty bhikshu precepts, the three hundred sixty-three bhikshuni precepts

[2890-2892]
—these are the foundation. Without discipline, meditation has no base. Without ethical conduct, wisdom has no ground. Do not think one can skip this! The great Dzogchen practitioners of the past were also great upholders of discipline.

Generating the mind of awakening [2893]—this is the entry into the Great Vehicle. Not just wishing to be enlightened, but wishing to awaken for the benefit of all beings. This changes everything! Practice is no longer for oneself; it is for everyone. Obstacles become opportunities to develop patience. Successes become offerings to others.

The eighty-five training sutras [2894], the four establishments of mindfulness on the small path of accumulation [2895], the four right abandonments on the medium path [2896], the four miraculous feet on the great path [2897]—this is systematic progression! Each stage builds on the previous. Each practice prepares the ground for the next.

The five faculties on the path of heat and peak [2898]—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom. Like five roots drawing nourishment from the soil of practice. The five strengths on the path of patience and supreme dharma [2899]—the same five, now unshakeable, irreversible.

The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment on the path of seeing [2900]—mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These blossom when directly perceiving emptiness. Not merely understanding intellectually, but seeing directly, unmistakably, that all phenomena lack inherent existence.

And finally the eight aspects of the superior path on the nine grounds of meditation [2901]—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The complete integration of wisdom and conduct, the fruition of the path.

[2899-2902]
. But practice knowing that the practitioner is already perfect, the practice is already complete, and the result has never been absent. This is the bodhisattva's secret: working tirelessly while knowing there is nothing to do.

[2899-2902]
. These are not outdated categories! They describe how mind training actually works.

First, mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena—this stabilizes. Then right exertion to abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome—this energizes. Then the bases of miraculous power—this concentrates. Then faculties and powers—this makes practice unshakeable. Then the branches of enlightenment—this opens wisdom. Finally the eightfold path—this integrates everything into a complete way of being.

The Vaibhasikas and Sautrantikas debate about atoms and moments [2549, 2580], about what is ultimately real. The Vaibhasikas accept partless dust-atoms; the Sautrantikas say even these are conceptual. But both realize the person-selflessness—the "I" cannot be found in the aggregates. This is huge! Most beings never question the self at all. These practitioners analyze until they see: no self in form, in feeling, in perception, in formations, in consciousness. Where is it then? Nowhere!

Yet they stop halfway. They realize the person is empty, but they think dharmas—the atoms, the moments, the elements—are real. This is like cleaning the house thoroughly but leaving one room locked, one closet unexamined. The self-enlightened ones go a bit further, seeing that outer dharmas are also empty [2731], but they still grasp at the mind that knows this emptiness.

This practitioner who reads—do not repeat their error! When realizing emptiness, do not grasp at the realization. When seeing no self, do not establish a "no-self" to cling to. Go all the way to the Middle Way, where even emptiness is empty, even liberation is not something to attain.

[2903-2961]
, the stages and grounds, the heat and patience and peak. Reading this, one thinks "I must achieve these stages!" But this old hermit who has been trying to get somewhere for decades—listen.

The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the path of no-more-learning

[2903-2902]
—these are not places one arrives at. They are descriptions of how recognition deepens. When first hearing the teachings and feeling inspired, one is on the path of accumulation. When beginning to practice consistently, the path of preparation. When having a genuine glimpse of emptiness—even for a moment—the path of seeing opens.

But do not grasp at these as achievements! The bodhisattva who thinks "I have reached the first ground" has already fallen back. The grounds are not rungs on a ladder; they are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely one has released the illusion of a self who progresses.

The ten grounds themselves—Great Joy, Stainless, Luminous, Radiant, Difficult to Overcome, Manifest, Gone Afar, Immovable, Excellent Intelligence, Cloud of Dharma [2974]—describe the maturing of wisdom. Great Joy: initial recognition brings overwhelming happiness. Stainless: one no longer creates new karma binding. Luminous: wisdom shines clearly. And so forth, each ground dissolving deeper obscurations.

But hear this: one does not need to wait lifetimes to experience these! Right now, in this moment, can one rest in recognition? That is the ground of Great Joy. Can one do so without creating new grasping? That is Stainless. Is the recognition clear? That is Luminous. Do not postpone this!

The fruit—the eleventh ground of All-Illumination, the Dharma body and form bodies

[2903-2961]
, and one must hear this not as future attainment but as present possibility! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place reached after eons of practice. It is the nature of awareness right now, when fully recognized.

The Dharma body for self-purpose, the two form bodies for others

[2903-2961]
, and one must understand: this fruit is not far away! The ground of All-Illumination [2905] is not a place reached after eons. It is the nature of awareness right now, fully recognized.

The Dharma body for self-purpose [2905]—the empty, luminous nature of mind itself, knowing its own nature without obstruction. The two form bodies for others

[2905-2913]
—is not something one becomes in the future. It is what one already is, obscured by temporary clouds of confusion. The path is simply the clearing of those clouds. The sun does not need to be created; it only needs to be seen.

So practice the six perfections, the four immeasurables, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment

[2905-2913]
—is not a reward earned. It is what one already is, fully revealed when the clouds of confusion dissolve.

[2905-2908]
—this is the complete awakening. But what are these bodies? Not physical forms to acquire! The Dharma body is the empty, luminous nature of mind itself—the aspect knowing its own nature. The form bodies are the compassionate display spontaneously arising to benefit beings—the aspect appearing while remaining empty.

From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained"

[2906-2908]
—the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, the compassionate display spontaneously arising to benefit beings. These are not physical forms to acquire; they are modes of being when fully liberated.

Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms [2907]—the wisdom of knowing the nature of reality, and the wisdom of knowing its variety. Seeing emptiness and seeing form. Seeing the ultimate nature and seeing the conventional display. These are not contradictory! They are two aspects of the same knowing.

Working for the benefit of beings until samsara is emptied [2908]—this is the bodhisattva's endless vow. Not because samsara can never be emptied, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the play of awakening goes on.

From the Entrance: "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought, working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained"

[2910-2913]
. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes what happens when the mind is fully liberated. One becomes a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, one naturally provides. One becomes a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, one spontaneously manifests.

And "until liberation is attained" [2913]—this does not mean until YOU attain liberation. It means until ALL beings attain liberation. The bodhisattva's vow is endless, not because the bodhisattva fails, but because compassion is inexhaustible. Even when all beings are free, the display continues, the benefit continues, the play of awakening goes on.

The conventional and ultimate truths

[2910-2913]
. This is not poetry about some distant Buddha! This describes one's own mind when fully recognized. One becomes a wish-fulfilling tree—whatever beings need, one provides. One becomes a wish-fulfilling jewel—whatever they wish for, one manifests.

The conventional and ultimate explained again

[2918-2961]
are explained again here, but now in the context of practice. The false conventional—all imputed appearances

[2918-2961]
—the false conventional of imputed appearances

[2924-2928]
. The true conventional—the ten virtues, the thoughts of faith

[2924-2928]
, the true conventional of ten virtues and merit

[2929-2935]
. The nominal ultimate—what is established through reasoning

[2929-2935]
, the nominal ultimate established through reasoning

[2936-2944]
. The truly mental ultimate—emptiness utterly without anything

[2936-2944]
, the truly mental ultimate beyond all

[2945-2954]
.

But do not stop at the ultimate either! Even emptiness can be grasped. Even "ultimate" is a concept. Go beyond the beyond, to what cannot be named, cannot be thought, cannot be taught—yet is fully present in every moment of life.

[2945-2954]
. These distinctions are crucial! Do not confuse them. Do not grasp at any of them. Use them as a ladder, then let the ladder go when climbed.

[2960-2978]
, and these are crucial markers on the path! These are not abstract concepts—they are experiences one has as practice deepens.

Heat

[2960-2971]
is the first sign something is working. Like warmth before sunrise, one feels the approach of realization. It has three aspects: outer, inner, and both together. The outer heat arises when seeing entities as empty—when looking at the world and it no longer appears solid, real, graspable. The inner heat is the sixth—when understanding the pure knowable as empty, when even understanding is seen through. The heat of both arises when outer and inner are recognized as one display.

Patience

[2960-2978]
, and these are signs one can recognize in one's own practice! Heat is the first sign realization is approaching

[2960-2971]
—like warmth before sunrise. One feels something changing, something opening, something becoming possible that seemed impossible before.

The outer heat: entities appear as empty [2964]. The world loses its solidity, its heaviness, its inevitability. One sees through the illusion of substantial reality. The inner heat: understanding the pure knowable as empty [2968]. Not just outer objects, but inner knowing, the mind itself, is seen through. The heat of both: outer and inner recognized as one display

[2969-2971]
.

Then patience

[2971-2972]
comes next—not the patience of waiting, but the patience of not turning back. One has seen emptiness; now one can bear it. One no longer fears the void. One no longer needs to reconstruct solidity. One can remain in the openness without panic.

Then the peak [2973]—the highest point of worldly realization. One is at the summit of conditioned existence. Beyond this lies the supramundane, the direct perception of the noble ones.

Supreme dharma [2974]—this is the final stage before the path of seeing. One's practice is refined, pure, unsurpassed within the world. One is ready for the direct realization that will change everything.

And the ten grounds

[2971-2972]
—not waiting, but bearing. One has seen emptiness; now one can endure it. One no longer panics when the ground dissolves. One no longer rushes to reconstruct solidity. One can rest in openness without fear.

Then the peak [2973]—the highest point of worldly attainment. One has reached the summit of conditioned existence. Beyond this lies the supramundane, the direct perception of the noble ones. One is ready for breakthrough.

Then supreme dharma [2974]—the final refinement before the path of seeing. One's practice is pure, unsurpassed, completely prepared. The ground is ready; the seed of awakening will sprout.

The ten grounds

[2974-2975]
—from Great Joy to Cloud of Dharma—describe the maturing of that realization. Each ground dissolves deeper obscurations, manifests clearer wisdom. But remember: these are not places one goes; they are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely one has released the illusion of a separate self.

Then Longchenpa begins the explanation of established tenet views [2979], starting with the Mind-Only school

[2974-2975]
—from Great Joy to Cloud of Dharma—describe the maturation of buddhahood itself. Each ground dissolves deeper obscurations, manifests clearer wisdom. But these are not places one goes! They are degrees of non-grasping, measures of how completely one has released the illusion of a separate self.

Then Longchenpa turns to established tenet views [2979], beginning with Mind-Only

[2981-2982]
, and one must be careful here—this view is subtle and easily misunderstood!
