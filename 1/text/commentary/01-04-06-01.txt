[2873-2887]
First: through reasoning that examines and dissects. When nothing is established as dharma-nature. Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling. This is the ultimate truth as realized through analysis.

[2873-2874]
This mountain dweller...

[2875-2879]
As Two Truths states: Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate. When elaborations of arising cease, this is termed ultimate. The negation is not destruction. It is seeing through. Like realizing the mirage was never water. The water-ness was projection.

[2880-2887]
Second: phenomena primordial from beginning. Transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence. Sphere pure by nature. This is not achieved through analysis. It is recognized when analysis exhausts itself. Like a fire that burns its own fuel.

[2881-2887]
From Root Wisdom: Peace not known from elsewhere. Conceptuality nothing. Meaning not differentiated. Non-elaboration through elaborations. This is its essential characteristic. The characteristic is no characteristic. The description points beyond description.

[2888-2903]
Knowing and practicing. The graduated path. Ten novice precepts. Two hundred fifty bhiksu precepts. Three hundred sixty-three bhiksuni precepts. Eighty-five training sutras. Four establishments of mindfulness. Four correct abandonments. Four miraculous feet. Five faculties. Five strengths. Seven limbs of enlightenment. Eight superior paths. Nine grounds.

[2890-2903]
This is not bureaucracy. This is architecture. Each precept builds foundation. Each practice trains capacity. The path of accumulation. The path of preparation. The path of seeing. The path of meditation. The path of no-more-learning. Stages. Gradual. Necessary for those who need stairs.

[2895-2903]
The four establishments of mindfulness in small path of accumulation. Body. Feeling. Mind. Phenomena. Watching them without grasping. This is where recognition begins. Not as Dzogchen. As foundation. As preparation. The mindfulness itself becomes wisdom when recognition dawns.

[2900-2903]
The seven limbs of path of enlightenment. Mindfulness. Investigation. Energy. Joy. Relaxation. Samadhi. Equanimity. These are not obstacles to Dzogchen. They are Dzogchen's foundation. When recognized, they are self-liberated. When not recognized, they are training.

[2904-2914]
Third: fruit of complete perfection. Ground of all-illumination. Dharmakaya for self-purpose. Two form-bodies for others. Two wisdoms. Working for beings until samsara emptied. This is not poetic aspiration. This is the natural result of path complete.

[2910-2914]
From Entrance to Bodhisattva's Way: Peaceful body like wish-fulfilling tree. Like wish-fulfilling jewel. Working for benefit until liberation. Appearance free from elaboration. The bodhisattva does not vanish into nirvana. They remain. Serving. Until all are free.

[2873-2914]
Hence. The structure...

[2888-2914]
Between the graduated cultivation of the Vehicle of Characteristics and the sudden recognition of Dzogchen, Longchenpa holds both. Not rejecting gradual. Not clinging to sudden. The gradual is preparation for the sudden. The sudden is recognition of what gradual prepared.

[2914]
Look. It is here.
