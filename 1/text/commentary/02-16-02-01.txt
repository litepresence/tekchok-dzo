Etymology from Self-Arising—nine reasons it's called emanation-kaya:
1. Appearing suitable to world realm beings
2. Able to perform emanation-kaya's benefit  
3. Performing all actions
4. Able to liberate countless beings into expanse
5. Brief in time in one field realm
6. Compassion arising without direction
7. Wrathful and fierce when needed
8. Peaceful and certain
9. Beings see as beautiful

All these ways compassion appears—not limited to peaceful forms!

[1036-1041]
Characteristic: performing completion of two benefits for disciples. From Self-Arising: performing completion of actions, considered in two aspects.

[1042-1051]
Divisions: generally nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, etc. Here, depending on completion of two benefits: emanation-kaya of completed actions and emanation-kaya of performing actions. Self-benefit spontaneously established—completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate. Through three connections' emanation, benefit for six realms' self-appearance. Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful. Samsara's self-appearance must be emptied, for delusion-appearance must be emptied.

[1052-1061]
Common prayer: "May three lower realms be exhausted and emptied." For producing mind to liberate all beings. Particularly in bardo: releasing emanations, becoming Buddha—all actions. When six realms' stations appear in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate, teaching Dharma performs benefit. By that cause, samsara becomes empty, dissolving into nirvana through spontaneous accomplishment—called "Buddha entering nirvana."

[1062] This crucial for all with wisdom!

[1063-1071]
Appearance in emptiness for self-benefit, emanation arisen from oneself liberating oneself into expanse—called emanation-kaya of completed actions. From Self-Arising: liberating own continuum, manifestly awakened, then distributing emanations. Outer and inner actions complete. Thus considered emanation-kaya of completed actions.

Three kayas complete, friend—now recognize them in your own experience!

Emaho!

[1072-1080]
Listen carefully, dear one! When seeing the eight gates of the spontaneously accomplished intermediate state completed, liberated by knowing one's own face—in that impure samsara gate, oneself radiating light rays from the secret space of sambhogakaya father-mother union, entering individually into pure wombs at each station, appearing to be born—through teaching Dharma, showing liberation.

This is like opening emanations in a dream, summarized merely as self-appearance. When channels and elements are nearly pure, in this life too the six realms appear inside the thigle, bound by three inner crucial points, reaching exhaustion ground—not depending on distributing emanations. This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, that is the power of realization.

[1081-1100]
Second, the emanation-kaya of performing actions: to those abiding on the grounds, sambhogakaya appears; to the impure, supreme emanation-kaya appears; to the very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to their stations, performing benefit. From the Self-Arising Tantra: showing to each whatever tames them, appearing suitable to others—not deluded regarding others' benefit, able to transform into anything.

Afflictions are naturally nonexistent, yet latencies appear like a body. To beings arrived at the right time, showing great correct benefit. To whatever beings are to be tamed, appearing suitable to that very being.

[1101-1107]
That emanation-kaya performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges: teaching Dharma in each being's own language; knowing faculties and latencies, showing what is suitable to that thought; great vehicle, small vehicle, various vehicles, secret mantra generation and completion stages.

Emaho! Emanation-kaya's skillful means are limitless! Like a master illusionist, the Buddha appears in whatever form benefits each being!

[1108-1113]
Individual individuals, mind, wisdom, kunzhi—showing kunzhi as dharmakaya and so forth, though shown in many ways, the nature of Great Completion does not appear infinitely to all through the path, but only to some capable ones.

[1114-1137]
From Self-Arising: knowing all languages, showing that in whichever language. Gathering suitable with suitability—some through words, some through dependent arising, some through aspiration and application, some through generation, some through both, some through five enlightenments, some through three samadhis, some showing expanse and wisdom. Great Completion meaning is without contradiction place, appearing to some persons with karma. Thus showing: some showing rigpa as empty, some showing absence-of-rigpa as empty, some showing rigpa-not as inert, some showing rigpa alone, some showing kunzhi as dharmakaya, some showing without virtue or non-virtue, some showing possessing meditation, some showing without meditation. Thus by emanation-kaya that shows.

[1138-1148]
The unsurpassable secret mantra meaning was not spoken to some; what was not spoken does not become spoken. Though on occasion it becomes spoken, arhats, solitary realizers, and sutras—within which the name 'lower vehicle' does not exist—become proclaimers of unsurpassable vehicle. Therefore hidden from others of inferior mind, that person possessing those is considered emanation-kaya of performing actions.

[1149-1157]
Although Great Completion may arise, from up to secretmost cycle of instructions of mind-vast and this instruction, know that this unsurpassable Heart Essence, not arising from existence of infinitely long path, is very rare enumeration of Dharma. Therefore similar to jewel, it should be held as precious treasure. In Supreme Sutra: because arising is rare, because stainless, because possessing power, and because becoming ornament of world—therefore jewel itself.

Emaho! Rare and precious Heart Essence!

[1158-1173]
Fifth, method of examining emanation-kaya: Teaching Dharma with benefit and happiness to common beings through Buddha's emanation, the two benefits appear somewhat similar. From Self-Arisen: know the method of examining emanation—even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere. In crown ushnisha, one cluster of hair curling to the right; in heart center, form of vajra; birth in royal caste or high caste. Conducting conduct suitable to whatever, following whatever is spoken, not establishing one's own preferred desires. Deed, effort, and grasping naturally nonexistent, clearing doubt of whatever beings desire. Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya.

[1174-1176]
Although these marks exist showing that as emanation, whether others are suitable emanations or not is uncertain. With pure mind produced, one should strive to tame one's own continuum.

[1177-1181]
Second: individually explained, enumeration of five kayas—essence, etymology, appearance, division, meaning application.
