[19404-19420]
Analysis proceeds...

[19404-19415]
A humble practitioner...

[19416-19430]
Voice 20 proclaims: This very repeated familiarization from, experience higher increase appearance clear time is. Therefore from: eye net pattern, eye membrane, net, half-net appearance also see. Second, wisdom ripen bindu: from that, wisdom ripen bindu side abide, color clear sun mandala like. This familiarization again self-appearance see.

[19430-19450]
Recognition is immediate.

[19450-19470]
Thus. We proceed...

[19460-19485]
This old hermit watched clouds form shapes in the sky—elephants, dragons, mountains. The mind creates patterns where none exist. Bindu appearances are similar: wisdom's light taking form, not external objects. The yogi who grasps at forms remains deluded; the yogi who recognizes their nature advances.

[19470-19495]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Characteristic grasp awareness ripen bindu shape round center, great pure appearance half-body, solitary, father-mother, five families, sphere, great sphere all see. Experience exhaustion near. Bindu general shape round, familiarization dharma-nature exhaustion practice.

[19485-19510]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears as forms, yet no form is the bindu itself. Like a mirror showing faces—the faces are not the mirror, yet without the mirror, no faces appear. This is the play of wisdom, the dance of emptiness and clarity.

[19490-19515]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[19500-19525]
This old man once...

[19525-19550]
Voice 20 proclaims: Half-body and all appearances are wisdom's display. The bindu is the bridge between basis and path, between path and fruit. Recognize this, and every appearance becomes teaching. Miss this, and even visions become obstacles. This is the secret of Dzogchen practice.

[19540-19565]
In this manner...

[19555-19580]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't measure progress by visions. Some see rainbows, others see nothing—both can be advanced or deluded. The measure is recognition: do you know these as your own mind's display? That knowing is the only accomplishment.

[19570-19590]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who compare their bindu visions! "Mine are clearer," "Mine are more colorful." Fools competing in delusion! The bindu doesn't care about your comparisons. Recognition has no degrees. Either see or don't see. No middle.

[19580-19600]
Hence. The structure...
