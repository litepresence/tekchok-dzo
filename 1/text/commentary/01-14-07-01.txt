[19404-19420]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals light appearances. First: light carpet appear, bindu upward-stand arise when, wisdom self-essence pure appearance. This time tent-house below like, wisdom castle appear, clear very clear. Bindu and outer light all mixed, example space rainbow ground like appear.

[19404-19415]
This old practitioner once saw rainbows in mountain mist. They appeared vivid, yet had no substance. The five lights are like this—not solid, not nothing. When bindu ascends and mixes with outer light, visions appear like rainbows in space. These are signs of wisdom unfolding, not goals to achieve.

[19416-19430]
Voice 20 proclaims: This very repeated familiarization from, experience higher increase appearance clear time is. Therefore from: eye net pattern, eye membrane, net, half-net appearance also see. Second, wisdom ripen bindu: from that, wisdom ripen bindu side abide, color clear sun mandala like. This familiarization again self-appearance see.

[19430-19450]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. This is wisdom self-essence directly seen appearance. Wisdom ripen bindu side or horizontal appear, color five clear rays spread sun like. This repeated familiarization from wisdom all dimension appearance spear tip like, three-pointed weapon, five-pointed, weapon various, stacked stupas, great stupa, lotus, flower various, thousand-petalled lotus appearance see.

[19450-19470]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Experience increase appearance measure near arrive. Third, awareness ripen bindu: from that, awareness ripen bindu rim with, self-clear round this familiarized, great pure appearance see. These all bindu outer shape round, familiarized dharma-nature exhaustion practice.

[19460-19485]
This old hermit watched clouds form shapes in the sky—elephants, dragons, mountains. The mind creates patterns where none exist. Bindu appearances are similar: wisdom's light taking form, not external objects. The yogi who grasps at forms remains deluded; the yogi who recognizes their nature advances.

[19470-19495]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Characteristic grasp awareness ripen bindu shape round center, great pure appearance half-body, solitary, father-mother, five families, sphere, great sphere all see. Experience exhaustion near. Bindu general shape round, familiarization dharma-nature exhaustion practice.

[19485-19510]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears as forms, yet no form is the bindu itself. Like a mirror showing faces—the faces are not the mirror, yet without the mirror, no faces appear. This is the play of wisdom, the dance of emptiness and clarity.

[19490-19515]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Characteristic grasp awareness dimension five families exist here. Body ripen therefore awareness body ripen time called, wisdom body ripen called. These bindu channels inside resonance outer appear. Gather families: inner dimension essence body bindu, nature light bindu, compassion ray bindu—three entering bindu. Dimension appear bindu part, weapons, lotus, stupa, net pattern, wisdom castle five birth bindu.

[19500-19525]
This old practitioner once asked about bindu visions. His teacher replied, "The bindu is like breath—you can feel it, yet cannot grasp it. The visions are like breath's mist in cold air—visible, yet not the breath itself. Don't chase the mist; rest in the breathing."

[19525-19550]
Voice 20 proclaims: Half-body and all appearances are wisdom's display. The bindu is the bridge between basis and path, between path and fruit. Recognize this, and every appearance becomes teaching. Miss this, and even visions become obstacles. This is the secret of Dzogchen practice.

[19540-19565]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The bindu and light appearances are not external realities to achieve. They are the spontaneous display of awareness's nature. Like a lamp illuminating a room—the light is not separate from the lamp, yet the room appears. This is the great miracle of wisdom.

[19555-19580]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't measure progress by visions. Some see rainbows, others see nothing—both can be advanced or deluded. The measure is recognition: do you know these as your own mind's display? That knowing is the only accomplishment.
