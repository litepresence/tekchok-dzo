[8672-8673] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Between the stirring of wind and the entering of wisdom—this first joy arises not from seeking but from the natural play of elements.
The yogin who recognizes this entering wisdom finds that propulsion and gathering are not two separate movements but one gesture of recognition.
Like a river flowing into the ocean, the winds of prana dissolve into the expanse of knowing.

[8672-8673] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
Three words. Entering. Recognize. Stop.
What enters? Nothing. What recognizes? No one.
The joy that arises—let it arise. Do not grasp it. Do not push it away.
This is the first signpost on a journey without distance.

[8672-8673] Voice 13 (Patrul):
This old practitioner has seen many rush past this first joy, hungry for greater experiences.
They sit in their meditation box, squeezing their channels, forcing their breath—fools!
The first joy comes when you stop trying. Like a fruit ripening on the tree, it falls when it falls.
Your job is to create the conditions, not to pull the fruit before it's ready.

[8672-8673] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
In the dance of dakinis, this first joy is the opening gesture.
The winds swirl like scarves in moonlight. Entering wisdom wears a thousand costumes—now breath, now bliss, now clarity.
Do not be deceived by the costume. The dancer and the dance are not two.

[8672-8673] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
I was washing my bowl this morning when the first joy came—not in my cushion, not in my cave, but in the steam rising from cold water meeting hot rice.
Entering wisdom? It's everywhere! In the spoon lifting to the mouth, in the swallowing, in the satisfaction of a simple meal.
Don't make it complicated.

[8672-8673] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
Therefore. Thus. First joy represents the stage of engagement.
The prana vayus, specifically the entering wind, interface with consciousness at the navel center.
This is not conceptual joy but somatic recognition.
Precise analysis reveals five distinct characteristics: clarity, bliss, non-conceptuality, self-arising, and self-liberating.

[8672-8673] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
Rest here. Rest in this first joy. Do not rush to the second, third, fourth.
Each stage is complete in itself. The entering wisdom has nowhere to go—neither in nor out.
Resting in that recognition, you are already arrived.

[8672-8673] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced):
CUT THROUGH NOW! This joy you seek—WHERE IS IT?
In the past? Gone. In the future? Not come. Now? Show me this "now"!
You chase the winds like a dog chasing its tail. STOP!
The tail is already attached. The joy is already here. RECOGNIZE!
