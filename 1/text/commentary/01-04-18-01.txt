Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to explain the vital points of Dzogchen using his own body. "Placing wind in the nadi's vital point captures mind as diligence," he said, poking his chest. "Pith instruction extracting dharmata from source." He poked again. "That very gesture perfecting form, ceasing Buddha-sentient being distinction." He kept poking until he bruised himself. This old practitioner watched in silence. Finally he said: "The poking is not the point. The point is seeing who pokes."

Vital point of wind in body, severing body-mind connection. This sounds violent! But it's not severing like cutting. It's severing like realizing they were never connected—never separate. Leaving nadi-wind to distraction, movement self-liberates. This yogi once tried to control his wind for ten years. Controlled breathing, controlled movement, controlled everything. One day he got sick and couldn't control anything. That's when the wind taught him. First, not experiencing confusion, ignorance's cause purified; not abiding in present confusion, karma and affliction's basis emptied; future confusion impossible, karma's good-evil decided.

Nature without distinction, samsara-nirvana single ground; confusion completely pure, characteristics without confusion cause, three realms ejected. Third essence: falling basis empty, unreached constructed ground; nature beyond calculation, confusion-not-confusion not established; characteristics non-dual, confusion-not-confusion's companion absent. This old practitioner read these words for twenty years before understanding: confusion purified is not confusion removed. It's confusion recognized as empty. Like seeing through a mirage. The mirage doesn't disappear. You just stop chasing it.

Third, thigle placed in self-abiding: singular essence free from elaboration, without parts; nature without multiplicity, transcending expression words; characteristic all-pervading dharmata. Through recognition, decisive confidence. Divisions: aural and explanation lineages. Aural: connected one-to-one, close distinction; nature connected to ear faculty, others cannot interrupt, characteristics without wrapping, confidence with liberation certainty. This yogi once received aural transmission. The teacher spoke three words. Nothing special. But something shifted. Thirty years later, those three words are still unfolding.

[4020-4051]
Explanation lineage essence: unreached constructed dharmata, causeless, no basis to transform three realms. Nature: clear light without stain, knowing five wisdoms' characteristics. Characteristics: transcending examination, abiding in three kayas five wisdoms' intention. Divisions: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed secret circles. This old practitioner has been in all four circles. The outer taught him discipline. The inner taught him openness. The secret taught him directness. The unsurpassed secret taught him there's nothing to teach.

The vital points of Dzogchen are not techniques. They're not methods to achieve something. They're descriptions of what's already true. Placing wind in nadis? The wind is already there. Capturing mind? Mind is already captured—by itself. Perfecting form? Form is already perfect. This hermit spent years trying to "do" these vital points. Finally saw: the doing was the obstacle. The vital points are vital because they point to what cannot be pointed to. They're points where the pointer breaks. Where language fails. Where concepts dissolve.

[3994-4006]
Three types of confusion purified. Not experiencing confusion—past ignorance purified. Not abiding in confusion—present karma emptied. Future confusion impossible—decided. This is thorough! Every aspect of confusion addressed. But don't think this happens in sequence. Past, present, future—all purified in one moment of recognition. Time is a concept. Liberation is timeless. The single ground of samsara and nirvana—this is the Dzogchen view. Not two different places. One ground, two views. Confused view: samsara. Clear view: nirvana. Same ground.

[4007-4020]
Thigle placed in self-abiding. Thigle is the sphere, the bindu, the concentrated essence. Placed in self-abiding—not placed by someone, not received from somewhere. Self-abiding means naturally abiding, always abiding. You don't put it there. You recognize it's already there. This old practitioner looked for his thigle for years. Finally saw: the looking was the thigle. The searching was what he searched for. The seeker was the sought. This is the Dzogchen twist. The path is the goal. The seeking is the finding.

[4020-4051]
Four circles: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed secret. Progressive? Yes and no. The outer is for those who need structure. The unsurpassed secret is for those who can handle directness. But they're not hierarchical in value. They're hierarchical in subtlety. Some need more subtlety. Some need less. This hermit started with the outer. Eventually found the unsurpassed secret. Then saw: they were the same circle all along. The circles were just descriptions. The reality was always the same.

[3888-3892]
This practitioner returns to the poking hermit. He bruised himself trying to understand. Good effort! Misdirected. The vital points aren't physical locations. They're recognitions. Seeing who pokes. Seeing who practices. Seeing who seeks liberation. Find that one. Or rather, see that the one cannot be found. That's the vital point. The recognition that there's no one to recognize. The seeing that there's no one to see. This is Dzogchen. This is the great perfection.

[4020-4051]
Outer circle: afflictions as path, effortlessness, emptiness undivided. Inner circle: non-material, signless, always abiding. Secret circle: recognition and attainment simultaneous. Unsurpassed secret: not depending on words, direct seeing. This old practitioner describes these from memory. Can't say he's mastered them. But he's tasted each. The taste remains. The outer was necessary. The inner was liberating. The secret was direct. The unsurpassed secret was—beyond description.

[3994-4006]
This hermit returns to the single ground. Samsara and nirvana are not two. This is the highest teaching. But it's also the most misunderstood. Some hear this and think "I can do whatever I want." No! Samsara is still samsara. Nirvana is still nirvana. The confused view is still confused. The clear view is still clear. They're not the same in appearance. They're the same in nature. This distinction matters! Don't use the ultimate view to justify bad behavior. That's the worst deviation.

[4007-4020]
Aural lineage and explanation lineage. Two ways the teaching is transmitted. Aural is direct, one-to-one, heart-to-heart. Explanation is through words, concepts, texts. Both are valid. Both are necessary. This old practitioner has received both. The aural transmissions were moments—brief, powerful, life-changing. The explanation lineage was years—slow, steady, foundational. Both are precious. Neither is superior. Both lead to the same recognition.

Emaho! Circles within circles, secrets within secrets. The outermost circle is the same as the innermost. The biggest secret is that there's no secret. The vital points are not techniques. They're not methods. They're recognitions of what's already true. What was always true. What will always be true. Your own nature. Clear and empty. Luminous and free. Recognize this. Be free. Emaho!
