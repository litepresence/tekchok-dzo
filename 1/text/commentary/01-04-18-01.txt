[3888-3892] Placing wind in the nāḍī's vital point captures mind as diligence; pith instruction extracting dharmatā from source. That very gesture perfecting form, ceasing Buddha-sentient being distinction. Vital point of wind in body, severing body-mind connection. Leaving nāḍī-wind to distraction, movement self-liberates.

[3994-4006] First, not experiencing confusion, ignorance's cause purified; not abiding in present confusion, karma and affliction's basis emptied; future confusion impossible, karma's good-evil decided. Nature without distinction, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa single ground; confusion completely pure, characteristics without confusion cause, three realms ejected. Third essence: falling basis empty, unreached constructed ground; nature beyond calculation, confusion-not-confusion not established; characteristics non-dual, confusion-not-confusion's companion absent.

[4007-4020] Third, thigle placed in self-abiding: singular essence free from elaboration, without parts; nature without multiplicity, transcending expression words; characteristic all-pervading dharmatā. Through recognition, decisive confidence. Divisions: aural and explanation lineages. Aural: connected one-to-one, close distinction; nature connected to ear faculty, others cannot interrupt, characteristics without wrapping, confidence with liberation certainty. With letters and without letters—dharmatā meaning pith instruction.

[4020-4051] Explanation lineage essence: unreached constructed dharmatā, causeless, no basis to transform three realms. Nature: clear light without stain, knowing five wisdoms' characteristics. Characteristics: transcending examination, abiding in three kāyas five wisdoms' intention. Divisions: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed secret circles. Outer: afflictions not rejected, five poisons as path; nature without effort-accomplishment, whatever appears as dharmatā; characteristics without parts, emptiness not divided anywhere. Inner: non-material, signless dharmatā; nature without coming-going, always abiding wisdom; characteristics—root arising like shoot, unfolding like trunk, clear like flower, ripening like fruit. Secret: recognition and attainment simultaneous—hearing, contemplation, meditation not needed; nature breath-ceasing and Buddhahood simultaneous—effort-accomplishment and familiarization strength not needed; characteristics Buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneous—accumulation and merit not needed. Unsurpassed secret: not depending on words—wisdom not needed; nature: seeing directly—not abiding in conceptual grasping view; characteristics: four perceptions reaching measure—result three kāyas five wisdoms not needing to look.

[4051-4096] This is the unsurpassed secret: below this, dharmatā intellectual confidence; here, directly visible, sense-object range, through guru's power seeable—distinctly superior. All explained circles gathered into one sūtra: Longchenpa has nine, twenty-one thousand pages, three sections, thirty-five thousand chapters, eight great upaya, one hundred eighty gzerbu, one thousand five hundred gags, seven thousand shan-dhyed, one hundred fifty thousand la-zla, five thousand gnad, sixty-four thousand verses, two thousand named tantras. From Thal-gyur: "From Rangdrol Longchenpa, words' distinctions spread; three sections become nine longchenpas, condensed words sixty-four thousand verses, thirty-five thousand chapters, twenty-one thousand one hundred pages, topic equal to sky's end, cutting sentient beings' conceptions—this is the condensed topic."
