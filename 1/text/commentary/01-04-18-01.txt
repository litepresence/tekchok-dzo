Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to explain the vital points of Dzogchen using his own body. "Placing wind in the nadi's vital point captures mind as diligence," he said, poking his chest. "Pith instruction extracting dharmata from source." He poked again. "That very gesture perfecting form, ceasing Buddha-sentient being distinction." He kept poking until he bruised himself. This old practitioner watched in silence. Finally he said: "The poking is not the point. The point is seeing who pokes."

Vital point of wind in body, severing body-mind connection. This sounds violent! But it's not severing like cutting. It's severing like realizing they were never connected—never separate. Leaving nadi-wind to distraction, movement self-liberates. This yogi once tried to control his wind for ten years. Controlled breathing, controlled movement, controlled everything. One day he got sick and couldn't control anything. That's when the wind taught him.

[3900-3906]
Second vital point: dharmata's expanse, nothing not included, so samsara-nirvana's measure calculating; dharmata emptiness without fixation, so thing's change calculating; without action in expanse, so self-arisen wisdom. This is the vast view. The view from the mountaintop. Everything included. Nothing excluded. Not because everything is accepted. Because nothing was ever rejected. The expanse is vast enough for all. The wisdom is self-arisen, not manufactured.

[3907-3914]
Third vital point: own-position all dharmas' source, clear, special cutting. Nature without distinction, samsara-nirvana single ground; confusion completely pure, characteristics without confusion cause, three realms ejected. This old practitioner read these words for twenty years before understanding: confusion purified is not confusion removed. It's confusion recognized as empty. Like seeing through a mirage. The mirage doesn't disappear. You just stop chasing it.

[3915-3921]
Fourth: thigle placed in self-abiding. Singular essence free from elaboration, without parts; nature without multiplicity, transcending expression words; characteristic all-pervading dharmata. Through recognition, decisive confidence. This yogi once looked for his thigle for years. Finally saw: the looking was the thigle. The searching was what he searched for. The seeker was the sought.

[3922-3928]
Lineages: aural and explanation. Aural: connected one-to-one, close distinction; nature connected to ear faculty, others cannot interrupt, characteristics without wrapping, confidence with liberation certainty. This yogi once received aural transmission. The teacher spoke three words. Nothing special. But something shifted. Thirty years later, those three words are still unfolding.

[3929-3935]
Explanation lineage: unreached constructed dharmata, causeless, no basis to transform three realms. Nature: clear light without stain, knowing five wisdoms' characteristics. Characteristics: transcending examination, abiding in three kayas five wisdoms' intention. Divisions: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed secret circles. This old practitioner has been in all four circles. The outer taught him discipline. The inner taught him openness. The secret taught him directness. The unsurpassed secret taught him there's nothing to teach.
