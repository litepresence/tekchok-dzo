[9713-9713]
Inner-clear existing carries to exhaustion ground, primordial person's universal base self-arisen essence body inseparable. Emaho!

[9714-9733]
Yet like sun obscured by clouds, liberation recognizing own face, freed from all obscurations, realization manifest, original base and final liberation ground extremely different—this crucial point wise ones should know. Wisdom expanse swirling like crystal light, dharmakaya clear dawning like crystal itself. That self-recognized dharmakaya abiding in own bed, now wishing to hold unconfused ground, naturally clear directly zangthal great expanse clarity hrik freshness non-distracted sustaining is crucial. From Protector of Beings Glorious Sublime Lama's mouth: "Self-recognized dharmakaya own bed itself, wishing to hold unconfused ground whoever exists, all without error unconfused non-distracting doing is crucial, knowing like ocean meditation wise ones should know."

Thus well spoken. At this introduction time, relaxed, self also newly certain uncommon produced, showing others. Again World Sun Dharma Lord Lama's mouth: "Introductions gradually introduced, well cared for. Alala, Olala, what is this without parts?

[9757-9780]
Thus advised, future times entering this dharma should place thus in heart. Second point particular differentiation explaining sentient beings and wisdom's symbols extensively in two: root rigpa's deluded returning mode mind's introduction, and rigpa self-display possessing self-display wisdom introduction. First: from Introduction Ornament—"Emaho! Appearance as mind introduction, mind's arriving mode. Mind itself empty introduction, emptiness bliss expansion reached. Empty as rigpa introduction, rigpa itself expanse wisdom non-dual."

[9781-9806]
Here three: outer object key point establishing inner mind, inner mind key point establishing secret expanse, secret expanse key point establishing unsurpassed rigpa. First has showing appearance object baseless delusion, and showing appearance holder own mind empty two.

Emaho!

[9952-9972]

The Introduction Ornament Tantra says: Look at your own nature, suitable vessel disciple! In a dwelling place half-open, with sun ray holes, raise a clear mirror! See the five lights arise outside!

Place intelligence at the eye's top, see self-light clear outside! Look at each other from left corners, see the connecting thread-ray appearance! Or place light at eye's top, look at one another - see the three bodies connected as one method!

Look at butter-lamp essence with itself - meet primordial wisdom clear light's nature! Place two mirrors at colored pigment edge - with intelligent eye method supreme, look! Meet the mother-child measures of rigpa, know the dharmata mother measures!

Emaho!

[10017-10041]

[10173-10210]
Not at all! Some use sky as example, some use different elements, some use light, some use divine bodies!

The common vehicles generalize, some portions consider only impure-pure nature. But here, in this Secret Heart Essence meaning, no matter how many examples are shown, there is no place to deviate, no place to grasp!

For those who see awareness directly, examples are merely helpers. Then through essence, expansion, and dissolution manner - like a primordially pure crystal, great openness, pure like a crystal above - this is suitable and complete!
