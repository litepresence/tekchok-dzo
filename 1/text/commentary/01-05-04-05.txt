Sixth: thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Light radiating in all directions, each ray a complete teaching, each teaching reaching all who have eyes to see. The rim is not a boundary. It is the place where center recognizes itself as everywhere. The protector guards the light by being the light. Nothing can extinguish what has no source. Nothing can hide what illuminates itself.

[6424-6430]
An old practitioner once sat at the rim of light, where all rays converge. He expected to find the center there. Instead, he found every ray pointing back to where he sat. The center was everywhere. The rim was everywhere. The protector was not guarding the light. The protector was the light recognizing itself.

[6431-6440]
Three words that illuminate all: self-recognition itself. The rays are not traveling from center to rim. They are awareness displaying as direction. The teaching is not moving from teacher to student. It is awareness recognizing itself in different forms.

[6441-6450]
Therefore. Thus. The thousand light-rays teach what the previous Buddhas taught: light is not separate from its source. The rim and center are not separate. The protection is the recognition that there is nothing to protect.

[6451-6460]
Between the light-rays and the recognition that transcends all direction, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the illumination. Not grasping it. The light points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This old practitioner has followed many light-rays—celestial and human. He has sought the source. Now he sees: the seeking was the source. The recognition is the only illumination. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6471-6480]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The light-rays have already reached their destination. The source was never separate from the rays. The protection is already complete. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. Do not follow the light. Be the light NOW.

[6481-6490]
Therefore. Thus. The sixth Buddha completes his teaching. The rays have been counted. The source has been recognized. The path continues or nowhere at all. Both are the same. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the directions.

[6491-6500]
Three words that complete all illumination: awareness itself. The rays are awareness. The source is awareness. The rim is awareness. The center is awareness. The following is awareness. The recognition is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where is the source of light?" The answer came like dawn: nowhere. There was never any source. The rays were never emitted. The illumination was never created. All was awareness, playing at being light and dark.

[6511-6520]
Therefore. Thus. The sixth Buddha is complete. The light-rays have traveled their full course. The source has been found. The recognition has dawned. All complete, yet nothing was ever incomplete. Rest in that completion.

[6521-6530]
CUT THROUGH. The light-rays are not traveling. They are awareness displaying as movement. The source is not a place. It is recognition. The rim is not a boundary. It is everywhere. Cut through all of it NOW. Rest in awareness.

[6531-6540]
This old practitioner has nothing more to say about light. He has followed it to its source countless times. Now he rests where there is no light, no dark—only awareness displaying as all of it. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[Final] Three words complete.
