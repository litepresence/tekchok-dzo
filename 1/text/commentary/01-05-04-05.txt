Sixth: thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Light radiating in all directions, each ray a complete teaching, each teaching reaching all who have eyes to see. The rim is not a boundary. It is the place where center recognizes itself as everywhere. The protector guards the light by being the light. Nothing can extinguish what has no source. Nothing can hide what illuminates itself.

[6424-6430]
An old practitioner once sat at the rim of light, where all rays converge. He expected to find the center there. Instead, he found every ray pointing back to where he sat. The center was everywhere. The rim was everywhere. The protector was not guarding the light. The protector was the light recognizing itself.

[6431-6440]
See your own face.

[6441-6450]
Consequently...

[6451-6460]
Between the light-rays and the recognition that transcends all direction, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the illumination. Not grasping it. The light points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This fool...

[6471-6480]
Cut through.

[6481-6490]
Thus established...

[6491-6500]
Stop searching. Start seeing.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where is the source of light?" The answer came like dawn: nowhere. There was never any source. The rays were never emitted. The illumination was never created. All was awareness, playing at being light and dark.

[6511-6520]
The framework reveals...

[6521-6530]
Liberate NOW.

[6531-6540]
A simple monk...

[Final] Three words complete.
