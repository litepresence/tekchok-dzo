[8676] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Fourth joy—experience itself. Mind and wisdom, no longer two streams but one river.
The time when distinguishing is impossible—this is not confusion but clarity beyond distinction.
Like salt dissolving in water—where is the salt? Where is the water? The taste knows.

[8676] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
See your own face.
You have spent lifetimes separating experience from experiencer. Now they merge.
The merger is not a becoming but a recognition. What was always one is seen to be one.
Stop looking for two.

[8676] Voice 13 (Patrul):
This fourth joy—they call it co-emergent, lhan-skyes. Like a baby born with its cry already sounding.
You don't get this by practice. You don't get it by not-practicing.
This old man has nothing to say about it. If I say it's easy, you won't believe me.
If I say it's hard, you'll give up. So I say—boil your tea and drink it.

[8676] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
In the palace of Akanishtha, the fourth joy is the throne upon which all buddhas sit.
Co-emergent wisdom—sahaja-jnana—wearing the robes of a beggar, carrying the staff of an old man.
No one recognizes it. It walks through the marketplace, and the merchants haggle over prices,
unaware that liberation stands among them.

[8676] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
Making bread this morning. Flour, water, yeast, salt—all distinct.
Kneading, they become one. Baking, they transform.
The bread emerges from the oven—where is the flour? Where the yeast?
The fourth joy is like that bread, co-emergent from many, tasting of one.

[8676] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
Accordingly. The analysis.
Key characteristic: indivisibility. Mind and wisdom—citta and jnana—are recognized as non-dual.
Precise analysis reveals this as the stage where subject-object collapse is complete, yet clarity remains.

[8676] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
Rest in the indivisible. The fourth joy is like space—no center, no edge.
Mind and wisdom are words for what cannot be divided.
Resting here, you are resting nowhere. This is the greatest rest.

[8676] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced):
INDIVISIBLE? Show me where they were divided!
You created the division with your thinking! Now you celebrate the reunion? FOOL!
There was never separation! The fourth joy is realizing the first three were unnecessary!
This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.
