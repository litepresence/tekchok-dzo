[9109-9117]
Listen well, dear practitioner! Longchenpa unfolds the mandala of methods like a merchant counting treasures. The complete examination of dreams—good and bad omens—six in number for those who elaborate. Then the progression: elaboration-without's outer, inner, secret, and complete—nine, thirteen, seventeen, twenty-one. Do you see the pattern? Each layer adds four, like rings expanding in a pond!

For the Shravakas—six; for the Pratyekabuddhas—five more, making eleven; for the Bodhisattvas—four, totaling fifteen. These are not just numbers, dear one! They represent how methods multiply as compassion deepens, as the view widens!

[9118-9128]
Now the inner empowerments! Kriya—nine, making twenty-four; Upa—nine, thirty-three; Yoga—nine, forty-two. The secret empowerments: Maha—twelve, fifty-four; Anu—six, sixty complete; Ati—four, sixty-four. See how Atiyoga has the fewest methods? Not because it's deficient, but because it's complete! When recognition dawns, who needs elaborate techniques?

The very-without-elaboration: sixty-four becomes ninety-four. The without-elaboration: fifteen makes hundred-and-nine. The with-elaboration: six, plus eight conveyance dharmas, fifteen. These aren't abstract mathematics—these are the pathways from confusion to recognition, from bondage to liberation!

[9129-9133]
Look at the outer empowerments of without-elaboration's with-elaboration: lama's action and student's action—two. Inner: mandala and vase—four. Secret: mandala's well-explained dharma—five; vase's well explanation—five, making ten. Each number is a door, practitioner! Enter through any, and you reach the same palace. But Atiyoga's door is widest—no door at all! Emaho!

[9141-9149]
Listen, dear one! The secret mandala entry—three aspects: introducing awareness into expanse through vital-point, pointing out expanse-awareness through deity recognition, making Buddha's heir through name empowerment. These three, plus the complete: outer prophecy through verses on sense-faculties and objects—experiencing non-dual knowledge and sphere; inner mind-clarity prophecy through verses—empowerment free from birthless recognition; secret entering without division—encouragement through verses showing non-dual expanse-awareness great bliss. Twelve in total!

Do you see? Each level peels back another layer of obscuration. Outer: sense and object dissolve. Inner: mind's clarity reveals no birth. Secret: expanse and awareness were never two!

[9150-9169]
The very-without-elaboration's outer: suitable entry, suitable attainment—two. Inner: certain conduct, certain view—four. Secret: race distinction, self-abiding—six. Complete: cause and condition—eight. The completely-without-elaboration's outer: mind abiding, speech abiding—two. Inner: speech transformed, mind attained—four. Secret: bliss prophesied, secret released—six. Complete: dwelling in manifestation, own action attained—eight. Thus without-elaboration's with-elaboration: sixteen. Its without-elaboration: twelve, making twenty-eight. Its very-without-elaboration: eight, thirty-six. Its completely-without-elaboration: eight.

[9170] Through empowerment, attained result: sixty-four! Listen, practitioner—all these numbers are fingers pointing at the moon. Don't count the fingers! Look at what they indicate: your own nature, already perfect, never stained. Emaho!

[9344-9348]
Listen here, practitioner! The great yoga's stages—four of them: very yoga ground, self-ground certain yoga ground, elaboration yoga ground, and action-free complete yoga ground. Do you hear the progression? From certainty in one's own nature, through the play of elaboration, to freedom from doing—these are not sequential achievements but simultaneous aspects of recognition!

[9349-9358]
The discriminating yoga ground: sign ground, meaning ground, sign-meaning non-dual ground, unmixed ground—four. The realizing yoga ground: miraculous emanation ground, distinction-realization ground, manifest arising ground, heroic race-distinction ground—four. Combined: sixteen grounds! These aren't rungs on a ladder, dear one—they're facets of a single jewel, viewed from different angles.

[9359-9368]
On the first ground, seven controlling miraculous powers arise: emanating body as hundred-thousand; emanating those as hundred-thousand limbs; on one body, emanating hundred-thousand heads; on hundred-thousand bodies, emanating one head; on one head, emanating hundred-thousand different bodies, then emanating from those; emanating countless different heads and limbs on body; emanating in various births—these seven come from realizing the controllable ground. On the second ground, opening one's own belly, showing entrails and heart-lungs to others—this power arises!

Don't chase these powers, dear practitioner! They're signs on the path, not the destination. The real miracle is recognizing what's already here! Emaho!

[9369-9375]
Hence. The structure...

[9370-9380]
This old hermit once met a yogi who had mastered all sixteen grounds. "Which was hardest?" the hermit asked. The yogi laughed. "The first, because I thought there would be a second. The last, because I thought I had finished. The middle fourteen were easy—I wasn't thinking."

[9375-9385]
Voice 20 proclaims: The grounds are not places to reach but recognitions to stabilize. Like learning to ride a horse—at first you hold tight, then you move with the horse, finally you and the horse are one movement. The sixteen grounds dissolve into one natural flow.
