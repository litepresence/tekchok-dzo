[8724] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Second: mixing with speech, one becomes self-natured as speech.
The union of body, speech, and mind with consort and wisdom proceeds in stages.
Having established the body as the deity, now speech must be purified.
Not the ordinary speech of gossip and complaint, but vajra speech—the sound of emptiness resounding.

[8724] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
Three words. Speech. Mix. Become.
What is your speech now? Wind through vocal cords, shaped by tongue and teeth, carrying the poison of duality.
"I like this. I hate that." Mix this speech with mantra, and it becomes vajra speech.
Mix vajra speech with silence, and it becomes wisdom speech.
Mix wisdom speech with recognition, and you become speech itself.

[8724] Voice 13 (Patrul):
They chant their mantras like donkeys braying! Om mani padme hum, om mani padme hum—while their minds calculate profit and loss.
This old man has heard enough mantra to fill the Ganges, but how many understood?
Mixing with speech means letting the mantra mix with your very breath. Not reciting—becoming.

[8724] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
The union of speech is the union of sound and emptiness.
When the yogin recites, the sound arises from space and dissolves into space.
The consort is not outside—she is the emptiness that gives birth to sound.
The wisdom is not elsewhere—it is the recognition that sound has no substance. Yet it resounds!

[8724] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
I was singing to my yak this morning. Just a simple herding song.
But as I sang, I felt my voice leave my body and become the mountain air.
The yak looked at me, and I swear he understood.
Mixing with speech—my song became the valley, the valley became my song. No difference.

[8724] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
Therefore. Thus. The second stage of union focuses on vak, speech.
The process: mixing (dres pa) leads to self-natured identity (bdag nyid du 'gyur).
Precise analysis: ordinary speech—vyavahara-vak—is transmuted into mantra-vak through the four purifications of speech.
Then mantra-vak becomes wisdom-vak through recognition of shabdha-shunya.

[8724] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
Let your speech rest in its own place. Not forcing mantra, not suppressing ordinary talk—just resting.
In that rest, mixing happens naturally.
You become self-natured as speech when speech no longer belongs to anyone.
It speaks itself, hears itself, dissolves into itself.

[8724] Voice 22 (Drolo):
Mixing with speech? SUDDEN WRATH! They think they need to mix something!
The speech is already mixed with emptiness. Every sound is already mantra. Every word is already wisdom.
Your attempt to mix is the only obstacle! STOP MIXING AND RECOGNIZE!

[8724] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
The self-nature of speech is not achieved but recognized.
Like an echo in a valley—you shout, and the valley answers.
Was the echo created? No. Did it exist before the shout? No.
Yet it resounds perfectly. Your vajra speech is like that echo—dependent arising, empty of self, yet fully manifest.
Mix with this recognition, and you are speech's self-nature.
