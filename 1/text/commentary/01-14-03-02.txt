Hence. The structure...

[17884-17898]
Voice 20 proclaims: First, essence—knowledge what object-subject grasper-holder arise, possessing non-awareness pervader. Definitive meaning: because grasper-holder arise, object and subject mind through, thus called mind. Above two minds' samadhi one-pointed attachment also grasper-holder. Desire in all-conception coarse.

[17890-17902]
Look. It is here.

[17902-17914]
Consequently...

[17909-17920]
These all also self-arisen ultimate meaning general grasp—directly object impossible, samsara aspect belonging, mind gathered. From Uttaratantra: self-arisen ultimate that, faith itself realization object, sun mandala clear-light though, eye not-possess see nonexistent. Thus spoken like.

[17915-17932]
This old hermit remembers his first glimpse of mind-itself. It was not in meditation, not in study, not in practice. It was while washing his bowl—the mind dropped, and there it was, clear as mountain stream. Ever-present, never hidden. The mind-itself pure, not to be made pure.

[17921-17945]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Impure mind distinction: briefly-shown and extensively-explained. First is: expanse impure nonexistent though, that from move time basis-appearance cut impossible what also arise. Non-awareness play from mind, mind ornament from intellect, intellect from affliction arise. That also play—capacity, power, ray like, that from arise tone just. Seed from sprout, face form from that reflection mirror arise like. Ornament—ripen arise grain portion, seed flower mark like.

[17933-17945]
Between seed and flower, the vast middle way opens. The seed does not become the flower—the flower was already present in the seed. Likewise, mind-itself does not become pure—it is pure from the first. The impurity is like frost on a window; the clear glass was never stained.

[17945-17962]
Thus established...

[17946-17975]
Second extensively explained three: root ignorance division, that from arisen mind division, that from arisen affliction division. First is: ignorance thus—root mind ignorance, confusion object ignorance, confusion-basis basis ignorance, grasping thought ignorance, artificial path ignorance, not-knowing delusion ignorance. Six ignorance forms arise, self appear not-see.

[17958-17983]
An old vagabond...

[17975-18007]
Voice 20 proclaims: These all object condition through—virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified mind three gather. Mind from intellect arise: all-search intellect etc. six. Third, that from arisen affliction distinction three: six root afflictions, sixteen proximate, subtle-arise clear limitless. First from Sun-Moon Union: afflictions six—non-awareness, delusion, anger, pride, desire, jealousy.

[18002-18028]
The framework reveals...

[18032-18053]
Between the six and sixteen, the vast middle way opens. The afflictions multiply like reflections in a hall of mirrors—sixteen becomes twenty-five, becomes fifty-one, becomes eighty-four thousand. But cut the root non-awareness, and all reflections dissolve. The mirror itself is never stained.

[18049-18074]
These all sequence: that alone not-know delusion through all affliction make, object mind grasp, subject grasp intellect, both self grasp, all conception, meaning non-awareness, nature aim not-see, word meaning non-realized, general-specific not-understand, delusion know promise meaning wrong, object I grasp, other not-happy, object take, object special desire, slightly puff pride, object spread anger.

[18067-18098]
This old hermit laughed at his own afflictions. Anger like tiger, desire like bird, pride like lion—how serious they seemed! But like images in a dream, they have no substance. The dreamer worries about the tiger's teeth, but upon waking, laughs at the fear. Recognize the dream nature, and afflictions self-liberate.

[18087-18116]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions: twenty-five, fifty-one, thousand eight ten four. First root non-awareness pervader separately not-counted. Pervaded five poisons five distinguish—twenty-five. From Self-Arisen: delusion five, desire five, anger five, pride five, jealousy five. Second fifty-one: twenty-five on object, twenty-five on subject, plus root—fifty-one. Third eighty-four thousand: desire twenty-one thousand, anger twenty-one thousand, delusion twenty-one thousand, part equal twenty-one thousand. Sum thousand eight four.

[18105-18128]
Analysis proceeds...

[18111-18140]
That like karma afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors depend. That also consciousness group eight: basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause, conception-nonexistent clear. That from spread door five knowledge: eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent, ear sound, nose smell, tongue taste, body touch. That from grasper-holder intellect-consciousness two: object first general grasp, after particular grasp affliction-intellect—grasped and grasper.

[18128-18156]
This mountain dweller...

[18140-18163]
Between the eight and the one, the vast middle way opens. Intellect-consciousness two on virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified three exist, conception-possess, conception-nonexistent suitable exist. Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent. Thus three-realm mind mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only. From Two Truths: mind mental-factors three-realm superimposition form-possess conception. These abandon object—non-awareness nature is reason.

[18135-18163]
Voice 20 proclaims: Here mind path make Buddha desire—great text Madhyamaka etc. tradition through also. Mind mind-itself two distinguish, mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather, mind-itself nature pure accept object realize, path cultivate enter do. This that and part similar: awareness awareness from arise mind-itself, self characteristic grasp mind explain.

[18157-18176]
Thus. We proceed...

[18171-18193]
This fool...
