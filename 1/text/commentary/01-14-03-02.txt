[18262-18269]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis turns to wisdom nature extensively explained. From Thalgyur: Wisdom is not conception. Essence self-clear, heart-essence meaning. Divisions: three pure. Definitive meaning: primordially abiding meaning. Thus known as wisdom. This has four aspects: essence, definitive meaning, division, individual meaning.

[18263-18273]
This old practitioner once confused wisdom with knowledge. Like confusing the sun with a lamp. Knowledge is learned; wisdom is recognized. Knowledge is accumulation; wisdom is discovery of what was never absent. The distinction is crucial—without it, one practices in vain lifetime after lifetime.

[17884-17898]
Voice 20 proclaims: First, essence—knowledge what object-subject grasper-holder arise, possessing non-awareness pervader. Definitive meaning: because grasper-holder arise, object and subject mind through, thus called mind. Above two minds' samadhi one-pointed attachment also grasper-holder. Desire in all-conception coarse.

[17890-17902]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Division: pure and impure two. Pure: mind-itself pure and mind pure two. Mind-itself pure is mind and mental-factors, thing-mark grasp, empty dharma-nature thusness, self-awareness. From Rahula Grasp Object Praise: speak-think express-void prajnaparamita, not-arise unceasing space essence, self-jnana object-field, three-times Buddha mother homage. Thus arises.

[17902-17914]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Mind pure—path time mind conception uncorrupted, liberation cause suitable samadhi arise, and realization-possess compassion mind-generate etc. liberation cause suitable. From Precious Garland: emptiness compassion essence-possess, enlightenment accomplish some. Not-attachment, not-hatred, delusion nonexistent—virtuous karma produced.

[17909-17920]
These all also self-arisen ultimate meaning general grasp—directly object impossible, samsara aspect belonging, mind gathered. From Uttaratantra: self-arisen ultimate that, faith itself realization object, sun mandala clear-light though, eye not-possess see nonexistent. Thus spoken like.

[17915-17932]
This old hermit remembers his first glimpse of mind-itself. It was not in meditation, not in study, not in practice. It was while washing his bowl—the mind dropped, and there it was, clear as mountain stream. Ever-present, never hidden. The mind-itself pure, not to be made pure.

[17921-17945]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Impure mind distinction: briefly-shown and extensively-explained. First is: expanse impure nonexistent though, that from move time basis-appearance cut impossible what also arise. Non-awareness play from mind, mind ornament from intellect, intellect from affliction arise. That also play—capacity, power, ray like, that from arise tone just. Seed from sprout, face form from that reflection mirror arise like. Ornament—ripen arise grain portion, seed flower mark like.

[17933-17945]
Between seed and flower, the vast middle way opens. The seed does not become the flower—the flower was already present in the seed. Likewise, mind-itself does not become pure—it is pure from the first. The impurity is like frost on a window; the clear glass was never stained.

[17945-17962]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. That like also from Self-Arisen: completely pure primordial-pure appearance, non-awareness nonexistent, mind nonexistent, intellect nonexistent though, spontaneous-accomplishment power from non-awareness arise. Non-awareness play from mind arise, mind ornament from intellect arise, intellect object from five poisons arise. Five poisons from sixteen afflictions arise, sixteen from twenty-five, twenty-five from fifty-one, fifty-one from thousand eight ten four arise.

[17946-17975]
Second extensively explained three: root ignorance division, that from arisen mind division, that from arisen affliction division. First is: ignorance thus—root mind ignorance, confusion object ignorance, confusion-basis basis ignorance, grasping thought ignorance, artificial path ignorance, not-knowing delusion ignorance. Six ignorance forms arise, self appear not-see.

[17958-17983]
This old practitioner counted afflictions like a merchant counts coins. One thousand, two thousand—foolish! The number is endless because the root is one: not recognizing mind-itself. Cut the root, and the whole tree falls. Counting leaves is the work of scholars, not yogis.

[17975-18007]
Voice 20 proclaims: These all object condition through—virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified mind three gather. Mind from intellect arise: all-search intellect etc. six. Third, that from arisen affliction distinction three: six root afflictions, sixteen proximate, subtle-arise clear limitless. First from Sun-Moon Union: afflictions six—non-awareness, delusion, anger, pride, desire, jealousy.

[18002-18028]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: That also sequence—object-subject delusion-conception part delusion, wisdom awareness reverse just not-knowing, object hate part-possess, I-am pride, object desire, meaning non-realized other anger. Second sixteen proximate: non-awareness, mind, intellect, grasp, conception, not-know, not-see, not-realize, not-understand, self that impure, I as grasp, other jealousy, desire, attachment, pride, spread.

[18032-18053]
Between the six and sixteen, the vast middle way opens. The afflictions multiply like reflections in a hall of mirrors—sixteen becomes twenty-five, becomes fifty-one, becomes eighty-four thousand. But cut the root non-awareness, and all reflections dissolve. The mirror itself is never stained.

[18049-18074]
These all sequence: that alone not-know delusion through all affliction make, object mind grasp, subject grasp intellect, both self grasp, all conception, meaning non-awareness, nature aim not-see, word meaning non-realized, general-specific not-understand, delusion know promise meaning wrong, object I grasp, other not-happy, object take, object special desire, slightly puff pride, object spread anger.

[18067-18098]
This old hermit laughed at his own afflictions. Anger like tiger, desire like bird, pride like lion—how serious they seemed! But like images in a dream, they have no substance. The dreamer worries about the tiger's teeth, but upon waking, laughs at the fear. Recognize the dream nature, and afflictions self-liberate.

[18087-18116]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions: twenty-five, fifty-one, thousand eight ten four. First root non-awareness pervader separately not-counted. Pervaded five poisons five distinguish—twenty-five. From Self-Arisen: delusion five, desire five, anger five, pride five, jealousy five. Second fifty-one: twenty-five on object, twenty-five on subject, plus root—fifty-one. Third eighty-four thousand: desire twenty-one thousand, anger twenty-one thousand, delusion twenty-one thousand, part equal twenty-one thousand. Sum thousand eight four.

[18105-18128]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: These all mind, intellect, recollection, latency, doubt through produce, all arise, affliction influence imprint, samsara affliction do. From Sun-Moon Union: these etc. afflictions—thought follow hold mind, recollection follow hold intellect, interval connect latency, doubt all basis become conception, object thing grasp—measure nonexistent.

[18111-18140]
That like karma afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors depend. That also consciousness group eight: basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause, conception-nonexistent clear. That from spread door five knowledge: eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent, ear sound, nose smell, tongue taste, body touch. That from grasper-holder intellect-consciousness two: object first general grasp, after particular grasp affliction-intellect—grasped and grasper.

[18128-18156]
This old practitioner once thought the eight consciousnesses were real entities, like eight people in a room. But they are like eight waves on one ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. The ocean is not the waves; the waves are the ocean's display. Recognize the ocean, and waves are no obstacle.

[18140-18163]
Between the eight and the one, the vast middle way opens. Intellect-consciousness two on virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified three exist, conception-possess, conception-nonexistent suitable exist. Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent. Thus three-realm mind mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only. From Two Truths: mind mental-factors three-realm superimposition form-possess conception. These abandon object—non-awareness nature is reason.

[18135-18163]
Voice 20 proclaims: Here mind path make Buddha desire—great text Madhyamaka etc. tradition through also. Mind mind-itself two distinguish, mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather, mind-itself nature pure accept object realize, path cultivate enter do. This that and part similar: awareness awareness from arise mind-itself, self characteristic grasp mind explain.

[18157-18176]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: From Six Expanses—awareness awareness from arise mind-itself is stain conception all beyond, brief nirvana cause fruit all, awareness self-appearance see beings object-field. Self characteristic grasp mind: thus superimpose appearance all, exist appearance, nonexistent appearance, appearance, renown, view, meditation, conduct appearance, grasp, conception, afflictions, thought object appear all. Brief samsara dharma all is self characteristic grasp mind, beings six-classes self-same appearance all.

[18171-18193]
This old practitioner offers final advice: Mind and wisdom—know the distinction or wander in confusion. Mind is the thief; wisdom is the treasury. Mind is the prison; wisdom is the liberation. Don't polish the thief; recognize the treasury. Don't renovate the prison; walk out the open door.
