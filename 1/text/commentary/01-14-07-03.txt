[19406-19420]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Third, bindu rim arise. That also heart inside bindu that color five clear, color five ball like. Size moon eye like. Light measure complete sleep eye like. Clear measure dakini mind moving eye like.

[19406-19415]
This old practitioner once compared bindu appearances to the moon's reflection in water—clear yet intangible. The five colors appear like five colored threads woven together, each distinct yet forming one pattern. The size varies like the moon appears larger at the horizon.

[19410-19420]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Sometimes wisdom wind moves, channels empty clear smoky inside move abide. Familiarization arisen bindu practice take, wisdom actual appearance and, wisdom side only pure appearance arise, characteristic grasp wisdom side one pure.

[19415-19425]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Sense object first light carpet appear, that from piece and, incomplete and, swirling and, vague appear also arise. These are stages of appearance, not separate things. Like morning mist clearing—the mist doesn't go somewhere; it simply clears.

[19420-19430]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: The bindu rim appears in stages—first as light, then as colors, then as forms. Each stage is complete in itself, yet leads naturally to the next. Don't grasp at any stage; let them unfold like a flower opening.

[19430-19440]
This old hermit sat in dark retreat for months. At first, nothing. Then flickers, then colors, then bindu clear as crystal balls. But the real teaching came when he realized the bindu was not something appearing to him—it was his own nature showing itself to itself.

[19440-19450]
Voice 20 proclaims: The bindu rim is wisdom's seal pressed into space. Five colors, five wisdoms, five families—all appearing in one sphere. Don't count them. Don't name them. Let them be what they are: the spontaneous display of your own awareness.

[19450-19460]
Between clarity and confusion, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears to those who practice, yet is never separate from those who don't. Like stars hidden by clouds—the stars are not created by the clearing. The bindu is not created by meditation.

[19460-19470]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals: The bindu rim's five colors are not external pigments. They are the natural luminosity of awareness divided by conceptual mind into distinct hues. In truth, they are one light showing many faces.

[19470-19480]
This old practitioner once asked his teacher about the moon-sized bindu. "Is it really that large?" The teacher laughed. "Is the moon large or small? It depends on the eye that sees. The bindu is neither large nor small—it is the measureless appearing as measured."

[19480-19490]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who debate bindu size, color, number! They miss the point entirely. The bindu is not an object of knowledge. It is knowledge itself taking form. Stop measuring. Start recognizing.

[19490-19500]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The bindu rim is like a drop of water containing the ocean. Small in appearance, vast in nature. The five colors are the five wisdom oceans appearing as one drop. This is the miracle of awareness.

[19500-19510]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The third aspect—bindu rim—completes the triad of bindu appearances. Upward-standing, light threads, bindu rim—three gates leading to one palace. Enter through any, and you reach the same recognition.

[19510-19520]
This old hermit offers final teaching: The bindu appears according to your capacity. Some see clearly, some vaguely, some not at all. All are equal in nature. The bindu doesn't discriminate; only recognition matters. Rest in that, and perfect bindu appears naturally.
