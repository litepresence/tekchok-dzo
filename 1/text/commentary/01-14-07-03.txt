[19406-19420]
Thus. We proceed...

[19406-19415]
This yogi...

[19410-19420]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Sometimes wisdom wind moves, channels empty clear smoky inside move abide. Familiarization arisen bindu practice take, wisdom actual appearance and, wisdom side only pure appearance arise, characteristic grasp wisdom side one pure.

[19415-19425]
See what is.

[19420-19430]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[19430-19440]
This old hermit sat in dark retreat for months. At first, nothing. Then flickers, then colors, then bindu clear as crystal balls. But the real teaching came when he realized the bindu was not something appearing to him—it was his own nature showing itself to itself.

[19440-19450]
Voice 20 proclaims: The bindu rim is wisdom's seal pressed into space. Five colors, five wisdoms, five families—all appearing in one sphere. Don't count them. Don't name them. Let them be what they are: the spontaneous display of your own awareness.

[19450-19460]
Between clarity and confusion, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears to those who practice, yet is never separate from those who don't. Like stars hidden by clouds—the stars are not created by the clearing. The bindu is not created by meditation.

[19460-19470]
In this manner...

[19470-19480]
A practitioner...

[19480-19490]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who debate bindu size, color, number! They miss the point entirely. The bindu is not an object of knowledge. It is knowledge itself taking form. Stop measuring. Start recognizing.

[19490-19500]
Look. It is here.

[19500-19510]
Hence. The structure...

[19510-19520]
This old hermit offers final teaching: The bindu appears according to your capacity. Some see clearly, some vaguely, some not at all. All are equal in nature. The bindu doesn't discriminate; only recognition matters. Rest in that, and perfect bindu appears naturally.
