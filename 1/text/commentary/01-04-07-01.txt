[2983-2988]
Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent a winter trying to understand the Mind-Only view. He stared at the jewel reflected in his water bowl until the bowl froze solid. When the Cittamatras say "all is mind," they do not mean your personal mind, your thoughts and emotions, creates the world. They point to something vaster. The example given: a jewel reflected in water [2984]. The jewel appears in the water, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. The appearance is real as appearance, but the jewel is not where it appears to be. So with all phenomena—they appear to be out there, independent, but their actual nature is the knowing in which they appear. This is the Cittamatra insight, the Mind-Only view. Not solipsism. Not idealism. A recognition of how experience actually works.

[2983-2988]
Three positions on aspects and consciousness: some say as many aspects as there are objects, so many consciousnesses. Like when hearing a sound, only sound-consciousness arises, not form-consciousness. Others say aspects and consciousness are like a cracked egg—separate but arising together. The third says aspects and consciousness are non-dual, like a monkey entering a castle and appearing in all four directions at once. This hermit likes the monkey example. Monkeys are unpredictable, like mind. But he prefers the cracked egg. Yolk and white—distinct but inseparable. This is how aspects and consciousness relate. Distinct in appearance, inseparable in nature.

[2986-2988]
The debate about whether aspects and consciousness are one or different—this is not mere philosophy! It strikes at how you experience reality right now! When you see a tree, is the tree separate from your seeing? Is the seeing separate from the tree? Can you have one without the other? This yogi once investigated this for three years, walking through forests asking each tree: "Are you separate from my seeing?" The trees never answered. But one morning, after a night of no sleep, he looked and saw: the question itself was mind's display. The tree was mind's display. The asking was mind's display. Everything was mind's display. This is the Mind-Only recognition. Not that mind creates matter. But that matter and mind are not two.

[2989-2998]
The first Mind-Only position: when hearing a sound, only sound-consciousness arises, not form-consciousness. When engaging any object, that consciousness arises, others don't. So they assert as many consciousnesses as there are aspects. This is granular, precise, almost scientific. This hermit appreciates the rigor. But he asks: who counts the consciousnesses? Who observes the observation? An infinite regress opens like Russian dolls. You need a consciousness to observe the consciousness, and a consciousness to observe that consciousness. Where does it end? It ends when you see through the observer itself. When you recognize that the one who observes is also a display of mind. Then the regress collapses. The observer is observed. The seer is seen.

[2999-3008]
Second position: outer various appearances also arise from consciousness, and the consciousness apprehending them also arises from mind. Like a cracked egg, aspects and consciousness appear as object and perceiver in one mind. This moment when engaging an object, outer-aspect consciousness and inner-apprehending consciousness both arise. But through beginningless habituation, though appearing as two, they are established as nothing other than self-cognition alone—like a cracked egg. This old practitioner once meditated on this. Saw the yolk and white as separate yet together. Mind and its appearances—same relationship. The appearance depends on mind. Mind knows through appearance. Neither comes first. Neither is primary. They are the two aspects of one display.

[3009-3016]
Third position: outer object aspects appear variously, but one inner apprehending consciousness knows them. Like one monkey entering a castle quickly appears in four directions looking. Through the five gates, one consciousness enters and knows objects. This old practitioner likes this image less. Monkeys are troublemakers. But the point is clear: one consciousness, many aspects, like one mirror reflecting many faces. When knowing, aspects and consciousness are both mind's nature without distinction—like dream appearances and apprehending one's own aspect are non-dual in one sleep consciousness. The dream analogy again! So powerful. In a dream, the mountain and the climber are both dream-mind. Non-dual, yet appearing dual. This is exactly how waking reality works, say the Cittamatras.

[3009-3016]
False aspects are the habituation of perceiving external objects as aspects of consciousness, appearing confused. They are not truly established as consciousness. The consciousness meeting them is also false. Established by valid cognition, not by experience. Experience is not the measure—this is key! Your experience can be deceived. The mirage looks like water. The dream looks real. Only valid cognition, proper reasoning, can establish truth. But reasoning has limits too. Eventually, direct cognition must take over. This hermit once trusted his experience completely. Led him into many traps. Now he trusts reasoning more, but not completely. The middle way again. Not blind faith in experience. Not blind faith in reason. Something beyond both.

[3017-3027]
Impure false: present various aspects and the consciousness apprehending them are merely the appearance of mind's stains, nothing ultimately separate from the non-dual wisdom of the sphere with qualities. No consciousness established. The Buddha's Dharmakaya, stainless—this non-dual wisdom itself. The stainless suchness—stainless means never stained, not cleaned. This distinction matters! You're not polishing a mirror. You're recognizing it was never dirty. This old practitioner spent years trying to clean his mind. Purify it. Remove the defilements. Then he saw: the defilements were temporary, adventitious, not the nature of mind. The nature was always pure. Always stainless. The purification was the recognition, not the removal.

[3028-3034]
Pure: aspects and consciousness not even established as merely false. Through manifest attachment, habituated to mind's small work, eventually without thinking, the appearance of its aspects disappears and clear luminosity dawns. Object aspects appear, perceiving mind appears, but both are absent—like reflections in a mirror. Only self-cognizing wisdom ultimately exists. This is the Mind-Only attainment: not nothing, but knowing without known, cognizing without cognized. This hermit keeps a mirror in his tent. Every morning he looks. Every morning he forgets: the reflection is not the mirror, but where else could it be? The mirror doesn't cease to reflect. But it doesn't grasp at reflections. This is the model for mind.

[3035-3036]
Second position: Svatantrika and Prasangika Madhyamikas. Different approaches, same mountain. Don't get attached to the path. Walk it. This hermit spent years in debate between these schools. Svatantrika uses logic, builds arguments. Prasangika demolishes positions, shows contradictions. Both lead to emptiness. Both are fingers pointing. But the Prasangika finger is sharper, quicker. It cuts through grasping at logic itself. Not that logic is bad—just don't grasp. The progression from Mind-Only to Madhyamaka is natural. First you see mind is primary. Then you see mind is empty. The first insight undermines materialism. The second insight undermines idealism. Both are necessary steps on the path.

[2989-2998]
This hermit returns to the first position. When sound is heard, only sound-consciousness arises. This seems so clear! But investigate: what hears the hearing? Is there a hearer behind the hearing? Look now. Listen to a sound. Where is the boundary between sound and hearing? Between hearing and hearer? They collapse into each other like waves into ocean. This is the insight. Not that mind creates world. That mind and world are not two. The appearance is mind's display. The display is not separate from mind. This is the Mind-Only view. Profound! But incomplete. Because it still grasps at mind. The Middle Way will show: mind too is empty.

[2983-2988]
This practitioner returns to the jewel in water. The Cittamatra's favorite example. The jewel reflected is not in the water. But without the water, no reflection. Without the jewel, no reflection. Dependent arising! The reflection depends on jewel, water, light, observer. None of these are the reflection. Yet without them, no reflection. So where is the reflection? Nowhere in particular. Everywhere it appears. This is the nature of all phenomena, say the Mind-Only school. Appearing in mind, but not mind's creation. Dependent on mind, but not reducible to mind. This subtle distinction saves them from solipsism. From idealism. From the extremes that destroy the view.

Emaho! Mind-Only is a stepping stone, not a destination. Use it to cross the river, then leave it behind. Don't build a house on the stepping stone and call it home. The river keeps flowing. The stepping stones keep appearing. Walk on. Don't stop. The other shore is not somewhere else. It's right here, seen differently. Mind-Only helps you see it. Then you have to let go of Mind-Only too. Even the view of emptiness must be emptied. Even the realization of mind must be transcended. This is the way. This is the path. This is the great perfection that includes all views and transcends all views. Emaho!
