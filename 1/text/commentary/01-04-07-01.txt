When the Cittamatras say "all is mind," they do not mean your personal mind, your thoughts and emotions, creates the world. They point to something vaster. The example given: a jewel reflected in water [2984]. The jewel appears in the water, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. The appearance is real as appearance, but the jewel is not where it appears to be. So with all phenomena—they appear to be out there, independent, but their actual nature is the knowing in which they appear. The debate about whether aspects and consciousness are one or different

[2983-2988]
They assert that all appearances are aspects of consciousness, that there is no external reality separate from mind. This is a crucial insight! But they stop there, grasping at mind as truly existent. The Middle Way goes further, showing that mind too is empty. This is the path you must follow—not stopping halfway, not establishing anything, even emptiness, as the final truth.

—the reflection appears, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. So with all appearances—they appear, but not as they seem. The Mind-Only view corrects materialism but risks idealism. The Middle Way transcends both.

[2986-2988]
—this is not mere philosophy. It strikes at how you experience reality right now! When you see a tree, is the tree separate from your seeing? Is the seeing separate from the tree? Can you have one without the other? Investigate this directly, not conceptually.
