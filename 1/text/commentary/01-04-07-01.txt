First: regarding objects that appear. When analyzed with reasoning. Not established as one. Not established as many. Beyond one and many. This is the way things abide. This is not philosophical position. This is how things actually are.

[2983-2986]
This old practitioner once tried to find the "one" behind appearances. He looked for unity. For ground. For source. He never found it. Every "one" he found turned out to be composite. Made of parts. Dependently arisen. The search for one revealed many.

[2983-2986]
Then he tried to find "many." Distinct phenomena. Inherently existent things. He never found them. Every "many" dissolved upon analysis. Into dependence. Into relation. Into emptiness. The search for many revealed nothing.

[2986-2990]
Beyond one and many. This is not both. Not neither. It is the transcendence of the framework itself. Like trying to count space. Is space one? Is it many? The question dissolves. The counting dissolves. Recognition dawns.

[2987-2990]
The Treasury uses reasoning—not to establish position. To dissolve positions. Not one. Not many. Not both. Not neither. This is the fourfold negation. Not as nihilism. As liberation from conceptual proliferation.

[2983-2990]
This practitioner warns: do not make "beyond one and many" into a position. "I am beyond one and many." That very statement is one. The beyond-ness is another. Both must be liberated. Even the liberation must be liberated.

[2983-2990]
Therefore. Thus. Objects when analyzed. Neither one nor many. This is their nature. This is their emptiness. This is their dependent arising. Three terms. One reality. Different aspects. Same recognition.

[2983-2990]
Between the analytical negation of one and many and the direct recognition of Dzogchen, we find the complete view. Analysis shows what is not. Recognition shows what is. Together, they point beyond both showing and not-showing.
