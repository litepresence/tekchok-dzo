[2983-2988]
Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent a winter trying to understand the Mind-Only view. He stared at the jewel reflected in his water bowl until the bowl froze solid. When the Cittamatras say "all is mind," they do not mean your personal mind, your thoughts and emotions, creates the world. They point to something vaster. The example given: a jewel reflected in water [2984]. The jewel appears in the water, but is the jewel in the water? No. Does that mean there is no jewel? No. The appearance is real as appearance, but the jewel is not where it appears to be. So with all phenomena—they appear to be out there, independent, but their actual nature is the knowing in which they appear. This is the Cittamatra insight, the Mind-Only view. Not solipsism. Not idealism. A recognition of how experience actually works.

[2989-2998]
The first Mind-Only position: when hearing a sound, only sound-consciousness arises, not form-consciousness. Like when hearing a sound, only sound-consciousness arises, not form-consciousness. This is granular, precise, almost scientific. This hermit appreciates the rigor. But he asks: who counts the consciousnesses? Who observes the observation? An infinite regress opens like Russian dolls. You need a consciousness to observe the consciousness, and a consciousness to observe that consciousness. Where does it end? It ends when you see through the observer itself. When you recognize that the one who observes is also a display of mind. Then the regress collapses. The observer is observed. The seer is seen.

[2999-3008]
Second position: outer various appearances also arise from consciousness, and the consciousness apprehending them also arises from mind. Like a cracked egg, aspects and consciousness appear as object and perceiver in one mind. This moment when engaging an object, outer-aspect consciousness and inner-apprehending consciousness both arise. But through beginningless habituation, though appearing as two, they are established as nothing other than self-cognition alone—like a cracked egg. This old practitioner once meditated on this. Saw the yolk and white as separate yet together. Mind and its appearances—same relationship. The appearance depends on mind. Mind knows through appearance. Neither comes first. Neither is primary. They are the two aspects of one display.

[3009-3016]
Third position: outer object aspects appear variously, but one inner apprehending consciousness knows them. Like one monkey entering a castle quickly appears in four directions looking. Through the five gates, one consciousness enters and knows objects. This old practitioner likes this image less. Monkeys are troublemakers. But the point is clear: one consciousness, many aspects, like one mirror reflecting many faces. When knowing, aspects and consciousness are both mind's nature without distinction—like dream appearances and apprehending one's own aspect are non-dual in one sleep consciousness. The dream analogy again! So powerful. In a dream, the mountain and the climber are both dream-mind. Non-dual, yet appearing dual. This is exactly how waking reality works, say the Cittamatras.

[3017-3027]
Impure false: present various aspects and the consciousness apprehending them are merely the appearance of mind's stains, nothing ultimately separate from the non-dual wisdom of the sphere with qualities. No consciousness established. The Buddha's Dharmakaya, stainless—this non-dual wisdom itself. The stainless suchness—stainless means never stained, not cleaned. This distinction matters! You're not polishing a mirror. You're recognizing it was never dirty. This old practitioner spent years trying to clean his mind. Purify it. Remove the defilements. Then he saw: the defilements were temporary, adventitious, not the nature of mind. The nature was always pure. Always stainless. The purification was the recognition, not the removal.

[3028-3034]
Pure: aspects and consciousness not even established as merely false. Through manifest attachment, habituated to mind's small work, eventually without thinking, the appearance of its aspects disappears and clear luminosity dawns. Object aspects appear, perceiving mind appears, but both are absent—like reflections in a mirror. Only self-cognizing wisdom that experiences that meaning ultimately exists. This is the Mind-Only attainment: not nothing, but knowing without known, cognizing without cognized. This hermit keeps a mirror in his tent. Every morning he looks. Every morning he forgets: the reflection is not the mirror, but where else could it be? The mirror doesn't cling to reflections. It doesn't reject them. It just reflects. This is the model for mind.

[3035-3036]
Second position: Svatantrika and Prasangika Madhyamikas. Different approaches, same mountain. Don't get attached to the path. Walk it. This hermit spent years in debate between these schools. Svatantrika uses logic, builds arguments. Prasangika demolishes positions, shows contradictions. Both lead to emptiness. Both are fingers pointing. But the Prasangika finger is sharper, quicker. It cuts through grasping at logic itself. Not that logic is bad—just don't grasp. The progression from Mind-Only to Madhyamaka is natural. First you see mind is primary. Then you see mind is empty. The first insight undermines materialism. The second insight undermines idealism. Both are necessary steps on the path.
