Five men stone fortress peak five poisons moving awareness self-abode delusion caused. Emaho! Symbols indicate wisdom meaning!

[12500-12519]
reveal the ground of appearing!

Existence called-as arise! Sentient-being-by-means-of form think-by-means-of not-imagine arise! Delusion path and thought also how think thought like thought arise!

That Vajrasattva awareness! Field Broad! First four! Place Beautiful! Basis appear spontaneous-by-means-of arise door! Time when destroyed!

Self ignorance other-as appear-by-means-of delusion-basis-by-means-of appearance! Pig year! Ignorance actual all-imagine time! Created sun!

Object appear coarse-as grasp-by-means-of thought clear part! Star Bird! Object attached desire-as arise! Old-one! Ignorance-by-means-of consciousness delusion-grasp-as arise!

Lineage not-determinate! Basis appear that where-also arise! Liberation delusion two both! Common ground be-from delusion to say!

Like a crystal that shows all colors but remains colorless itself! Like space that accommodates all forms but is never formed!

The basis is neither pure nor impure! It is the ground from which both arise! Do not cling to liberation! Do not fear delusion! Both are waves on the same ocean!

The six realms are your own face! The six poisons are wisdom's display! Do not reject! Do not accept! Simply recognize what already is!

Emaho! The ground that is no ground!

[12546-12565]
unveil the profound meaning hidden in appearances!

Old-one heap-possess-by-means-of door close! Yacha! Then man four-by-means-of chase catch! Man five horse from separate! Yacha! Son two self-by-means-of self lose! Prison guard kill! Yacha!

Son two rain sun-possess-as flee! Subjects on tax gather! Queen twenty one-by-means-of counsel do! Samrudra god-house to flee! Man five armor five wear! Door guard-by-means-of! Who-also come not-capable! Yacha!

Then mirror four-by-means-of face look! Self-by-means-of self face know! Yacha! Then house one-to door eight exist see! Self to self laughter lose! Yacha!

Thus symbol appearance all! Indicate-by-means-of wisdom meaning to apply! Said! That teacher Light-Spread! Self arise-by-means-of wisdom! Son two! Awareness pure and spontaneous-by-means-of wisdom two! Cave-as prison grasp!

Like a coded message from a hidden king! Like a treasure map disguised as a child's drawing! The symbols point to what cannot be spoken directly!

The four men chasing—the four elements binding! The five horses separating—the five senses dispersing! The two sons losing themselves—pure awareness and spontaneous wisdom trapped in the prison of grasping!

The twenty-one queens counseling—the twenty-one demonstrations of primordial wisdom! The five armored guards—the five wisdoms protecting!

The four mirrors showing—the four lamps revealing self-face! The house with eight doors—the eight consciousnesses! Losing laughter—recognizing the absurdity of seeking what was never lost!

Read the symbols! Decode the message! The teacher has already shown you your own face!

Emaho! The secret language of realization!

[12583-12602]
point to the ultimate recognition!

Rigpa eye-in enter-from space-awareness-of appearance-to look! Five-doors overpower-from various experiences self-arise gather! Noble-lady advice make-from temple-to flee! Five-men cover under protect!

Rigpa-of primordial-wisdom introduction twenty-one-by demonstrate! Self-appearance meditate time! Thought dispersion gather! Self-cease meaning inner arise! Outer bindu light-five rim possessing! Unmoving focus-from arise! Thought-by gap not-find!

Mirror four-by sign look-from! Self-face know! Lamp four's primordial-wisdom-to look! Self-awareness self-place abide! Meaning inner arise! House door-eight see-from laugh lose! Spontaneous appearance see-from original space-to strong-ground seize!

Third is! Again that-from! Again realm great-circle named! Mud great some within-in! Lamp one not-extinguish dwell! Realm light possessing named! Teacher mirror-possessing named-by see!

That-to this word thus speak: Hey sentient-being light possessing you listen! I you-to prophecy give! Not-distracted listen!

Like entering a palace of mirrors and finally seeing your own face! Like finding the lamp that was always lit but never noticed!

The five doors overpowered—the five senses gathered into one taste! The noble lady's advice—rigpa's own instruction! The five men covering—protection of the five wisdoms!

Twenty-one demonstrations—the complete introduction! Thought dispersion gathered—self-liberated! Outer bindu lights—five wisdoms unmoving! Mirror four—self-face recognized! Lamp four—self-awareness abiding!

The eight doors of the house—eight consciousnesses seen through! Laughter lost at the absurdity of seeking! Spontaneous appearance—original space seized!

The great circle realm—mud within! The unextinguished lamp—light possessing realm! The teacher with mirror—showing you yourself!

Listen! Do not be distracted! The prophecy is given!

Emaho! The recognition of what was always so!
