Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: From the same source: Mind is latencies all basis. Embodied beings' stain. Grasp object, hold mind—that's samsara's dharma-nature. Jnana is separate from recollection-basis. From Six Expanses: If mind and wisdom self-essence not distinguished, like sun obscured by cloud-masses, outer appearance meaning impossible. Mind is karma, afflictions, latencies—all basis, source, accumulation, arising. Non-awareness house, always abiding, opposing wisdom sun, obscuring.

[17673-17688]
See what is.

Analysis proceeds...

[17693-17713]
This old hermit tells a story: A man carried a heavy stone for miles, complaining of its weight. Another asked, "Why don't you drop it?" The first replied, "I didn't know I could." Mind is like this stone—we carry it lifetime after lifetime, not knowing we can simply let go. Wisdom is already free; mind is what binds.

[17714-17725]
Voice 20 proclaims: From Pearl Garland—conceptions all burned. Wisdom itself like fire consumes. Equal to space itself. Empty-luminous awareness-possess itself. Some here not-knowing: if mind nonexistent, becomes inanimate or darkness—they have small learning. Though mind nonexistent, wisdom exists, awareness not ceasing.

[17720-17737]
Thus. We proceed...

[17731-17744]
Between obscuration and clarity, the vast middle way opens. Mind pervaded by non-awareness—suitable as mind pervader. Awareness not pervaded by non-awareness. Non-awareness ceasing from awareness expanse, or continuum breaking. Therefore mind ceasing time, basis non-awareness with part ceases, though awareness unceasing—because cease-basis is awareness.

[17738-17758]
If awareness also nonexistent, what top to cease is suitable? Here non-awareness with mind part ceases—awareness expands as wisdom, enjoying two knowledges. From Pearl Garland: Mind movement all separates, not inanimate. Knowing and awareness—clear appear. Thus spoken. Mind and wisdom each-other. Common body from also. Mind and mind-itself nature pure—two distinguished.

This yogi...

Accordingly. The analysis...

[17764-17783]
Vehicle this to wisdom to Buddha ground-path-fruit enumerate through—quickly liberated from samsara. Others, samsara root to enlightenment hope, even long time that obtain difficult—because ground-manner err. From Kunzang Heart Mirror: Mind from Buddha desire—from me err. Thus spoken. Err manner: reason and scripture both contradict. Thus mind from Buddha and path and ground three open if, open-ground mind itself grasp-grasp possess—your ground path fruit all grasp-grasp possess result.

[17778-17795]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Desire Buddha not accomplished; accomplished also reverse result—because not liberated from grasp-grasp. Also mind habit karma various gather like—ground path fruit also that result. Desire if, delusion as result flaw exists! Opponent says: Mind nonexistent if, Buddha not-reason. Buddha that by mind distinction done—as you also desire purpose.

[17780-17801]
In this manner...

[17786-17810]
This old hermit offers final teaching: You seek Buddha in mind, like seeking gold in a lump of coal. Mind is the problem, not the solution. Wisdom is not made from mind—wisdom is what remains when mind ceases. Stop polishing the brick; it will never become a mirror.
