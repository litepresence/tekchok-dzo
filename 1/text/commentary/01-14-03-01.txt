[17644-17667]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis turns to the crucial distinction between mind and wisdom. Second: extensively explained from respective aspects—mind and wisdom nature. First: from Mu-tig Phreng-ba (Pearl Garland)—mind and wisdom distinction, scholars should know. Thus arises: Mind is root non-awareness, co-existing with stains, like clouds obscuring the sun of wisdom. Wisdom is co-existing with Dharmakaya, stainless, not abiding with mind's recollection-thought, like the sun.

[17656-17661]
This old practitioner once thought mind and wisdom were the same, just different names. Like calling water by different names in different villages. But this is ignorance! Mind is the cloud; wisdom is the sky. Mind gathers latencies; wisdom burns them. They are not the same—not even close.

[17662-17676]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: From the same source: Mind is latencies all basis. Embodied beings' stain. Grasp object, hold mind—that's samsara's dharma-nature. Jnana is separate from recollection-basis. From Six Expanses: If mind and wisdom self-essence not distinguished, like sun obscured by cloud-masses, outer appearance meaning impossible. Mind is karma, afflictions, latencies—all basis, source, accumulation, arising. Non-awareness house, always abiding, opposing wisdom sun, obscuring.

[17673-17688]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Mind gathers all latencies. Mind accumulates all afflictions. Mind is basis of all latencies. These latencies—difficult to cut—self-appearance obscuring. Non-awareness equally abiding. From Mu-tig: Mind indeed gathers assembly. Coat with defilement. Basis-gathering mind etc. Become number of defilements.

[17685-17697]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Mind that obstructs rigpa—possessing that, called sentient being. Through mind karma accumulates, delusion itself, from one delusion to next, samsara's karma doing. Mind liberated from rigpa. If purified, exhausted, called Buddha. Because rigpa free from defilement. Thus true objects to be freed—defilement assembly—mind only.

[17693-17713]
This old hermit tells a story: A man carried a heavy stone for miles, complaining of its weight. Another asked, "Why don't you drop it?" The first replied, "I didn't know I could." Mind is like this stone—we carry it lifetime after lifetime, not knowing we can simply let go. Wisdom is already free; mind is what binds.

[17714-17725]
Voice 20 proclaims: From Pearl Garland—conceptions all burned. Wisdom itself like fire consumes. Equal to space itself. Empty-luminous awareness-possess itself. Some here not-knowing: if mind nonexistent, becomes inanimate or darkness—they have small learning. Though mind nonexistent, wisdom exists, awareness not ceasing.

[17720-17737]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Non-awareness delusion mind ceases—wisdom clear sun arises. Like day dawning when night ends. Some say non-awareness is awareness pervader—mind ceasing time awareness ceases. Very great mistake! Awareness pervades non-awareness outward, but non-awareness not pervade inward—like Buddha wisdom.

[17731-17744]
Between obscuration and clarity, the vast middle way opens. Mind pervaded by non-awareness—suitable as mind pervader. Awareness not pervaded by non-awareness. Non-awareness ceasing from awareness expanse, or continuum breaking. Therefore mind ceasing time, basis non-awareness with part ceases, though awareness unceasing—because cease-basis is awareness.

[17738-17758]
If awareness also nonexistent, what top to cease is suitable? Here non-awareness with mind part ceases—awareness expands as wisdom, enjoying two knowledges. From Pearl Garland: Mind movement all separates, not inanimate. Knowing and awareness—clear appear. Thus spoken. Mind and wisdom each-other. Common body from also. Mind and mind-itself nature pure—two distinguished.

[17752-17764]
This old practitioner meditated for years trying to purify his mind. Then one day he laughed—mind cannot be purified! It must be recognized as empty from the first. Like trying to wash a shadow—foolish effort. Drop the mind, and wisdom appears naturally. It was never hidden.

[17758-17776]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: That on, mind is all-conception samsara dharma. Mind-itself is elaboration-free nirvana dharma. From Prajnaparamita 8000: Mind on mind nonexistent. Mind nature luminosity—thus spoken. Thus mind and wisdom well separated. Common object-possess vehicle to mind ground-path-fruit does, though that all meaning directly not arrive.

[17764-17783]
Vehicle this to wisdom to Buddha ground-path-fruit enumerate through—quickly liberated from samsara. Others, samsara root to enlightenment hope, even long time that obtain difficult—because ground-manner err. From Kunzang Heart Mirror: Mind from Buddha desire—from me err. Thus spoken. Err manner: reason and scripture both contradict. Thus mind from Buddha and path and ground three open if, open-ground mind itself grasp-grasp possess—your ground path fruit all grasp-grasp possess result.

[17778-17795]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Desire Buddha not accomplished; accomplished also reverse result—because not liberated from grasp-grasp. Also mind habit karma various gather like—ground path fruit also that result. Desire if, delusion as result flaw exists! Opponent says: Mind nonexistent if, Buddha not-reason. Buddha that by mind distinction done—as you also desire purpose.

[17780-17801]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis answers: Mind nonexistent and exist through—Buddha become not thing. Dharmakaya wisdom exist nonexistent through—thus arise. Mind delusion wake through—Buddha distinction done true, though still ground spontaneous-presence Buddha not-certain—true actual also not thing. To-be-purified although purified, that to-be-purified not Buddha. Buddha from mind arisen not.

[17786-17810]
This old hermit offers final teaching: You seek Buddha in mind, like seeking gold in a lump of coal. Mind is the problem, not the solution. Wisdom is not made from mind—wisdom is what remains when mind ceases. Stop polishing the brick; it will never become a mirror.
