Analysis proceeds...

[10775-10780]
This mountain dweller...

[10779-10781]
See your own face.

[10781-10786]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: The critics sharpen their swords! If primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual in one's own face, they cry, then each position carries its own fault! If the essence were exclusively primordially pure without spontaneous presence, since samsara would not exist as other than purity, it would be unreasonable for sentient beings' confusion to ever arise! The ground of delusion would be removed, making delusion impossible!

[10784-10790]
Sever immediately.

[10785-10799]
Thus. We proceed...

[10788-10794]
This old hermit tells a story: A man dreams he is bound with ropes. He struggles all night, trying to escape. Upon waking, he finds no ropes, no bondage, no escape needed. Was his struggle real? In the dream, yes. Upon waking, no. Samsara is like this dream. The ropes of delusion never truly bound the dreamer. Liberation is not a future achievement but present recognition.

[10793-10799]
Between bondage and liberation, the vast middle way opens. When appearing as liberated into the expanse of space, from that time appearing as reverted is merely reversion without new arising, because liberation newly arising and bondage are not established as real entities. The ball thrown by a child returns to the hand naturally. No new ball is created; no old ball is destroyed. The appearance of bondage and liberation is the play of spontaneous presence within the essence that was never bound.

[10795-10799]
Voice 20 proclaims: Moreover, from the conventional aspect of appearance as spontaneous presence with all qualities, from the ultimate aspect of emptiness as primordially pure, it is merely expressed in words—beyond word and concept. Because those two—primordial purity and spontaneous presence—are not separate substances, they do not change separately or contradict. Just as being a vow-possessor and being fully ordained do not contradict but complement each other in the path.

[10799-10830]
Those are also the dispute-answers establishing non-duality. From the Klongdrukpa tantra: Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature. Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva. Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing in the field. The bodhisattva himself also asked the Teacher for clarification: If the nature itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete, are these sentient beings reasonably self-liberated without effort? The Teacher responded: Because primordially spontaneously accomplished from the beginning. He spoke in response: These sentient beings, because the essence is primordially pure without stain, liberations also appear as play without contradiction.

[10815-10829]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[10825-10835]
Voice 20 proclaims: The Teacher's silence between words is the true teaching. The spoken words are invitations to silence. Don't cling to the invitation. Attend the feast of recognition where words have never been.

[10830-10845]
In this manner...

[10840-10850]
This old hermit offers final word: The debate is over. The dispute is dissolved. What remains is recognition. Rest in that, and all questions answer themselves.
