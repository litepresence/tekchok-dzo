[10775-10781]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues regarding the dispute and response. First: regarding the two dispute-responses. The dispute arises from those who say "it follows as an eighth basis"—adding non-duality as yet another position to the seven already refuted. The response is elegant: one holds primordial purity and spontaneous presence as non-dual, not as separate from the gathering of the seven bases, but as their resolution. Thus one does not turn away from the seven; one transcends them. Therefore, there is no fault of following as an eighth basis. This is not adding another position but dissolving the very framework of positions.

[10775-10780]
This old practitioner once sat in a debate hall where scholars argued for three days about whether non-duality was the eighth position. Finally a master stood up and said, "You are like men arguing about whether the sky is the eighth color. The sky is not a color at all!" The room fell silent. Non-duality is not a position—it is the end of positions.

[10779-10781]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The phrase "one's own face is primordially pure" does not contradict the non-dual view. Because one holds the essence to be primordially pure, there is natural connection. The essence is pure; the nature spontaneously present. Two aspects of one reality, like heat and light of one flame.

[10781-10786]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: The critics sharpen their swords! If primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual in one's own face, they cry, then each position carries its own fault! If the essence were exclusively primordially pure without spontaneous presence, since samsara would not exist as other than purity, it would be unreasonable for sentient beings' confusion to ever arise! The ground of delusion would be removed, making delusion impossible!

[10784-10790]
CUT THROUGH NOW! They fear liberation! They cling to delusion as real! If spontaneous presence alone without primordial purity, then whoever accepts this position follows that one is primordially liberated without any effort or recognition—no practice, no path, no accumulation of merit and wisdom! They say this is a fault, but it is only a fault to those who still believe in bondage!

[10785-10799]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis cuts through the confusion. It follows that primordial purity and spontaneous presence contradict each other when posited as separate substances of a single basis—this is the fundamental problem requiring resolution. The answer: because the essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in samsara as real entities. From the power of spontaneous presence as merely the play of the path, appearing like that does not contradict primordial purity—the two are non-dual.

[10788-10794]
This old hermit tells a story: A man dreams he is bound with ropes. He struggles all night, trying to escape. Upon waking, he finds no ropes, no bondage, no escape needed. Was his struggle real? In the dream, yes. Upon waking, no. Samsara is like this dream. The ropes of delusion never truly bound the dreamer. Liberation is not a future achievement but present recognition.

[10793-10799]
Between bondage and liberation, the vast middle way opens. When appearing as liberated into the expanse of space, from that time appearing as reverted is merely reversion without new arising, because liberation newly arising and bondage are not established as real entities. The ball thrown by a child returns to the hand naturally. No new ball is created; no old ball is destroyed. The appearance of bondage and liberation is the play of spontaneous presence within the essence that was never bound.

[10795-10799]
Voice 20 proclaims: Moreover, from the conventional aspect of appearance as spontaneous presence with all qualities, from the ultimate aspect of emptiness as primordially pure, it is merely expressed in words—beyond word and concept. Because those two—primordial purity and spontaneous presence—are not separate substances, they do not change separately or contradict. Just as being a vow-possessor and being fully ordained do not contradict but complement each other in the path.

[10799-10830]
Those are also the dispute-answers establishing non-duality. From the Klongdrukpa tantra: Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature. Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva. Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing in the field. The bodhisattva himself also asked the Teacher for clarification: If the nature itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete, are these sentient beings reasonably self-liberated without effort? The Teacher responded: Because primordially spontaneously accomplished from the beginning. He spoke in response: These sentient beings, because the essence is primordially pure without stain, liberations also appear as play without contradiction.

[10815-10829]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes the debate. The bodhisattva asked to clarify further doubts: If the essence itself is primordially pure alone, spontaneous accomplishment would also become unnecessary. Or, if all is spontaneously accomplished without purity, primordially pure would not become manifest. The Teacher spoke regarding the way of existence beyond extremes: Because there are no words by which to express the ultimate, being free from words of expression and sound entirely, because the essence of anything is not established as real, words are free from harming this ultimate nature. Sentient beings, from the object of self-grasping mind alone, because variety, recollection, and thought do not cease in delusion, words do not harm the essence—there is no distinction in the nature. Because of the term ultimate and conventional distinction.

[10825-10835]
Voice 20 proclaims: The Teacher's silence between words is the true teaching. The spoken words are invitations to silence. Don't cling to the invitation. Attend the feast of recognition where words have never been.

[10830-10845]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: The non-dual basis resolves all disputes not by winning but by dissolving the battlefield. No winner, no loser, no dispute. This is the Great Perfection's secret weapon—peace, not victory.

[10840-10850]
This old hermit offers final word: The debate is over. The dispute is dissolved. What remains is recognition. Rest in that, and all questions answer themselves.
