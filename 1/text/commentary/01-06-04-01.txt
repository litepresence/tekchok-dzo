The teaching opens like a door that was never closed. What enters? Only what was already inside. The words are fingers pointing at a moon that has never been absent.

[36-70]

[211-245]
This fool.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[351-385]
Thus established.
