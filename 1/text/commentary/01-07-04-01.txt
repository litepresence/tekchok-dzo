To violate this is to violate the very nature of reality itself! The secret of secrets—the guru himself! The guru is not a person outside you. The guru is your own rigpa, appearing in form to guide you. To see the guru as ordinary is to see the ocean as merely water. To harm the guru is to drown in your own delusion! Twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind—these are your armor against the demons of doubt and distraction. Break them and you stand naked before samsara's storms. Keep them and you walk as a vajra master among men! Lines

[10115-10121]
warn: outer secret wrong view abandons the path. Inner secret disparages the dharma. Secret of secrets exceeds the root samaya. Each transgression cuts deeper than the last. Like a tree falling—first the branches, then the trunk, then the root!

Guard these secrets as you guard your own heart! For in them lies the path to liberation!

Emaho! The secret that cannot be told!

[10209-10224]
Body samaya transgressed—separated from Buddha-body. All three realm beings—compared to cutting life at one time? By defeat, sin is limitless.

Speech ceases—Buddha-speech doesn't dwell. Tongue faculty cut—sin is limitless.

[10209-10226]
reveal the devastating consequences of broken samaya—more terrible than death itself!

If body's samaya breaks, you separate from the buddha body! The three realms of existence become your prison, and one moment cuts your life stream. Sin without end! Limitless suffering! This is not poetic exaggeration—this is the nature of cause and effect!

If speech's samaya degenerates, buddha speech no longer dwells within you. The tongue that once recited mantras becomes a weapon against yourself. Like a bell that rings cracked—no pure sound emerges!

If mind's samaya shatters, your meditation becomes poison. The virtue you cultivate turns to sin. Disturb the mind of a virtuous monk even once, and sin increases without measure! This is the heaviness of guru reliance—the greater the height, the harder the fall!

From the Glorious Sky of Exhaustion Tantra: even in dreams, if mindfulness degenerates, if bad thoughts arise—the seed of downfall is planted. The guru who gave you empowerment, who opened the door of mantra—if you betray this connection, you burn seven times more than the vajra sibling, one hundred times more than the lineage guru, one hundred times more than the root guru!

These are not mere numbers. They are measures of the bond between teacher and student. The deeper the transmission, the greater the breaking!

Guard your samayas like a mother guards her only child! For in them lies the distinction between liberation and endless wandering!

Emaho! The weight of broken vows!

[10225-10279]
Mind degenerates? Filling three realms with meditators, disturbing mind—sin increases more. Especially guru-relying fall is heavy.

Without bad mind, by degenerate mindfulness in dream, or non-virtues becoming careless—confess aimed at guru. Bodily fault by body, speech and mind also. Not confessed immediately—experience uninterrupted suffering.

Guru is nature of all Buddhas. Teaching to liberate from samsara—object is fierce. Abandon non-faith, wrong mind, harm, speaking. Even if body's suffering becomes supreme, by own ability make effort. Guru's mind—even for moment must not be disturbed. Cherish his food and wealth as your own life. This is how yogi acts.

[10335-10345]
Letter not-have—that time guard one's boundary crossed. Not-have one alone vast—that one's companion. Meaning little explain—self's realization top from certainty straight direct spoke.

[10335-10354]
pierce to the heart of Great Completion's samaya—primordial purity and spontaneous presence!

The boundary of rigpa—this is not a fence you build! It is the natural limit where awareness cannot be moved. When you cross it, you wander alone in vastness. Your only companion becomes your own delusion!

Cut-through's samaya

[10341-10342]
: Samsara's dharmas are like mirages, like water in a desert, like the eight examples of illusion! They appear but have no true existence. Cling to them as real and you bind yourself with ropes of your own making!

Look! Whatever arises—thoughts, feelings, appearances—let them be! Do not seize them! The five senses wide open, awareness without basis, directly placed in vast expanse. This is the meaning of release into dharmata!

Leap-over's samaya

[10346-10426]
Nature great-completion's samaya—awareness self-arise wisdom primordial guard. Boundary crossed—nature not-move. Primordial-pure regarding cut-through's samaya—samsara's dharma appearance all primordial not-have. Mirage water etc illusion's eight-examples—know appearance true-clinging release.

Outer inner object not-have—mind seize's rope not-bound. Awareness vast gapless great guard. Clinging seize whatever not-do—door five wide-open. Object not-have's awareness basis not-have direct put—vast vast release. Appearance label dharma-nature release.

Spontaneous-presence regarding leap-over's samaya—self-arise's wisdom quality spontaneous accomplish. Gathering not-depend self face know accomplish certainty. Light five self-clear spontaneous-presence's nature appearance four's experience not-separate. Buddha self-nature accomplish. Other doubt not-need.

Condition appear pleasure-pain feel thought—whatever arise, whatever aware, self-arise's wisdom one-only certainty. All self-release spontaneous-equal great's meaning not-exceed.

[10346-10354]
: Self-arisen wisdom accomplishes spontaneously! It needs no gathering, no effort, no dependence on other causes. Like the sun that shines without being asked—self-clear, self-present!

The five lights and four appearances—they are not separate from your experience! Buddha nature accomplishes itself. No need to doubt! No need to seek outside!

Whatever appears, whatever you feel—pleasure or pain—recognize it as self-arisen wisdom. One taste, one certainty! This is the samaya of Great Completion!

Do not try to place what is already placed! Do not meditate what is already accomplished! Simply remain in the natural state, like a mountain unmoved by clouds!

Emaho! The samaya that cannot be broken!

[10360-10363]
, Longchenpa speaks of self-enlightened, self-liberated, trace without childlike, fixation without. Do you hear what he is saying? You look for enlightenment like a man searching for his glasses while wearing them on his nose. You are already what you seek. Primordially enlightened Samantabhadra's intention—this is not some ancient Buddha from a distant time. This is your own mind right now, before you think "I am."

[10364-10368]
, he says phenomena exhausted, primordially exhausted great. Anyone samsara not experience, samsara primordially exhausted. You hear this and you think "Then why do I suffer?" You suffer because you think you suffer. Samsara is not a place to escape. It is a label you put on experience when you grasp at it. When you stop grasping, where is samsara? Like a dream you wake from—did you destroy the dream? No, you simply realized it was a dream. The exhaustion here is not destruction. It is recognition.

At lines

[10369-10378]
, he says awareness sufficient, non-awareness sufficient, existence sufficient, non-existence sufficient, good sufficient, bad sufficient, realization sufficient, non-realization sufficient. You read this and your mind spins. "How can non-realization be sufficient?" You want to pick and choose. You want to keep awareness and discard non-awareness. But look—can you have light without darkness? Can you have up without down? They are not two things. They are one thing seen from different angles. Sufficient means complete. It means nothing needs to be added, nothing needs to be removed.

[10379-10383]
, phenomena existence not experience, anyone done not, done-to need not, non-existence-to mind fix not apply self-arisen. You think you must do something to realize this. You think you must practice, meditate, accomplish. But who is the doer? Where is the deed? To whom is it done? These three circles are empty from the start, like a sky flower. And mind that fixes on non-existence—that too is just another fixation. Let it be self-arisen, self-liberated.

, trace dissolved, self-settled, wide-open, undecided decided, not-dissolved dissolved, not-vanished vanished, not-cleared cleared, not-taxed taxed-to arisen is. What is he saying? He is saying the opposite of everything you think. You think you must dissolve something, decide something, clear something. But in the nature of mind, dissolution and non-dissolution are the same. Vanishing and not-vanishing—where is the difference when you do not grasp at either?

Great Perfection, primordially liberated, spontaneously accomplished yoga—at line [10392]. This is not a practice to do. This is the recognition of what you already are. At lines

[10393-10399]
, without-doing completed, without-going arrived, without-seeking found, without-accomplishing accomplished, without-abandoning purified. You hear this and you want to argue. "But I must do something!" Why? Who is this "I" that must do? Look for it. Can you find it?

[10406-10417]
, he warns you: Crucial is but not understand. Realization sufficient but effort need. You hear the teachings and you think you understand. But your understanding is just another concept. You have the word-taste, not the real taste. You realize something, but it is just an extent, a measurement. You meditate, but it is mind-made, fabricated. You analyze, but it is duality-grasp. You accomplish, but it is just more samsara.

, he asks: Still now dharmata's vast-expanse self where exist? Samsara from prior-mixing one-by not-transcended student-to, natural Great Perfection's karmic-connection one also come will. Phenomena exhausted self's appearance-to looked-by, mind exhausted alone joy lost. Action without dharmata's nature taken-by, hope-fear duality-grasp's defilement from liberated. Do you see? The dharmata is not somewhere else. It is not something you will find later. It is right here, but you miss it because you are looking for something special.

[10422-10467]
, meditate sufficient, place sufficient, do sufficient, abandon sufficient. This is fix-limit dharma non-existent self-to. Stop looking for a method. Stop looking for a place to meditate. Stop looking for something to do or abandon. Just rest as you are. Is that so difficult? Yes, because "you" want to do the resting. Let even that go.

[10427-10446]
shatter all your attempts to grasp spontaneous presence!

You try to seize what is already seized! You try to release what is already released! You place what is already placed! You meditate what is already meditated! You view what is already viewed! You traverse what is already traversed!

This is the madness of the dualistic mind! Like a dog chasing its own tail—round and round, never catching what was never lost!

Listen to the pointing-out: Do not dwell in doing! Do not need to do! Done—nothing to seize! Deed exceeded! No calculation of doing and not-doing!

Meditate? Not needed! Meditate? Nothing there! Meditate? Already exceeded! Meditated and exhausted!

Look? Not needed! Look? Nothing there! Look? Object exceeded!

What is there to look at? What is there to seek? Seeking itself is the obstacle! Finding is impossible because nothing was ever lost!

This is the great self-fall of spontaneous presence! Like waves on water—although they appear distinct, they are never separate from the ocean itself!

If you do not understand this, you will wander endlessly, grasping at what cannot be grasped, seeking what has always been present!

Stop! Release all effort! Let the mind rest in its natural state, like a river flowing effortlessly to the sea!

Emaho! The exhaustion of all seeking!
