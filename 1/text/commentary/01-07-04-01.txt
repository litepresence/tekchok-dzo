[10086-10114] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First outer outer—harmful mind abandoning. From Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken Tantra: whoever mantra-holder vajra holder, other or self, if hold harm-doing mind—leprosy-possessed body, cold touch possessing, body thousand-times five taken after, cold hell certain becomes. Supremely mantra entered, harm-doing mind done, above suffering experiences.

[10086-10114] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Harmful. Mind. Stop. The body and speech samayas were about action. Mind samaya is about intention. One moment of harmful thought creates karma that takes five thousand bodies to exhaust. Stop the thought at the root.

[10086-10114] Voice 13 (Patrul): They think "I didn't DO anything!" But the mind moved. The thought arose. This old man says—harmful mind is the seed. Action is just the sprout. Cut the seed, no tree. Guard your mind like a fortress.

[10086-10114] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The vajra holder who thinks harm is like a king carrying a hidden dagger. He looks noble, but the weapon is there. The cold hell is not punishment. It is the natural climate of a cold mind. Warm your mind with compassion, or freeze in your own hatred.

[10086-10114] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I wanted revenge once. Someone wronged me. The thought burned like fire. Then I saw—he's suffering too. The harmful mind hurt me more than him. Let it go.

[10086-10114] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Mind samaya first level: phyi'i phyi (outer-outer)—gnod sems spong (harmful mind abandoning). Precise analysis: gnas chen gnod sems (harmful mind) creates the cause for grang dmyal (cold hell). The mechanism: one moment of harmful thought equals five thousand body-takings in future lives.

[10086-10114] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The mind is the king. Body and speech are servants. If the king is cruel, the kingdom suffers. Make the king kind, and all prospers.

[10086-10114] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): HARMFUL MIND? speaks with fierce compassion The lion's mind has no harm! The lion's mind has no kindness! It just IS! See through the duality of help and harm!

[10099-10130] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Outer inner—guru and vajra siblings harmful mind abandoning. From Sky-Iron Fire Blazing Tantra: if common being object, harm mind arises—common body possessing, three hundred life cut, this sin's share equal. Teaching sign holding form, wrong becomes. Mantra entered, hundred-times. Vajra sibling seven-times, lineage guru hundred-times, root guru that one's hundred. Mantra door entered, empowerment obtained, supremely aspect-ripen thus.

[10099-10130] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Guru. Sibling. Mind. Stop. Harmful mind toward guru—hundred times worse than toward ordinary beings. Toward vajra siblings—seven times worse. The hierarchy of objects reflects the hierarchy of your own mind. See all as guru, and harmful mind becomes impossible.

[10099-10130] Voice 13 (Patrul): They get angry at the guru! "He didn't give me what I wanted!" This old man wants to shake them! The guru gave you the Dharma—what more do you want? Harmful mind toward guru is like biting the hand that feeds you. But worse—hundred times worse.

[10099-10130] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The guru is the display of your own wisdom. To think harm toward him is to think harm toward enlightenment itself. The lineage guru is the stream of blessing. To dam the stream is to die of thirst. The root guru is the source. To poison the source is to poison yourself.

[10099-10130] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I got angry at my teacher once. Felt justified. Then I saw—my anger was my own obstacle, not his. He remained calm. I suffered. Who was harmed?

[10099-10130] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. phyi'i nang (outer-inner)—bla ma dang mched lcam la gnod sems spong. Precise analysis: karmic multiplication hierarchy: common being—1x, teaching holder—100x, mantra entered—700x (vajra sibling 7 x 100), lineage guru—100x, root guru—100x. Supremely—empowerment obtained—exponential increase.

[10099-10130] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): See the guru as Buddha. See the sibling as Buddha. Then harmful mind is seen as impossible as the sky being red. The mind rests in recognition.

[10099-10130] Voice 22 (Drolo): HIERARCHY? MULTIPLICATION? The heruka sees all beings as equal! One harmful mind is ALL harmful minds! See through the calculation!

[10115-10143] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Outer secret—self-other established-view wrong-view arise abandoning. From Great Arrangement: self or other's hidden Dharma disparage, wrong path, root samaya exceeded, earth-dwell fire suffering, long time dwell. Self's established-view wrong-view arise, hell itself liberate chance not. Mind's inner outer—conduct, inner—meditate, secret—wrong view abandoning. From Crystal House Stacked Tantra: view, meditate, conduct wrong—path wrong great, beings all's suffering this mind ripen certain.

[10115-10143] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Wrong. View. Stop. The outer secret—don't disparage others' paths. The inner—don't confuse meditation methods. The secret—don't abandon right view. Wrong view is the root of all harm. Cut it, and the tree falls.

[10115-10143] Voice 13 (Patrul): They say "My view is higher!" This old man says—all views are ladders. The rung you're on seems highest until you climb higher. Don't kick away the ladder that brought you up. Don't disparage the path that others walk.

[10115-10143] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The established views are the cages of the mind. Wrong view is the bird that thinks the cage is the sky. Break the cage. The sky was always there. But don't tell other birds their cages are wrong. Show them the sky through your own flight.

[10115-10143] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I thought my way was the only way. Then I met a hermit who never heard of Buddha. His mind was pure. His view? Simple kindness. I learned—view is in the living, not the labeling.

[10115-10143] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. phyi'i gsang (outer-secret)—rang gzhan gyi grub mtha' la log lta (self-other's established-view wrong-view). nang gi gsum (inner's three): spyod pa (conduct), bsgom pa (meditate), lta ba (view). Precise analysis: log lam (wrong path) results from reversing these three.

[10115-10143] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The right view is no view. The wrong view is any view grasped. Let views arise and dissolve like breath. Don't hold, don't push.

[10115-10143] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): VIEW? NO VIEW? speaks with fierce compassion See through the viewer! The lion has no view! The lion SEES! See through wrong and right!

[10134-10178] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Secret's three outer—view, meditate, conduct. Inner—yi-dam deity. Secret—guru and vajra siblings day-night mind done. From Lotus Klong Tantra: whoever mind's karma wander, mind done dharmas, mind not-done degenerate, past ceased karma's end, uninterrupted suffering experiences. From Co-Arisen Near-Taken Tantra: actual-accomplish supreme desire, yi-dam abandon not, guru abandon actual-accomplish destroyed, other where accomplish not find. Therefore Dharma promise taken, guru's before samaya pledged, mind thought virtue's karma—self abandon actual-accomplish degenerates.

[10134-10178] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Mind. Done. Secret. Stop. The secret of secrets—what you think day and night about guru and sangha. This is the deepest samaya. Let your mind be Buddha-mind, and all is complete. Let it be ordinary mind, and accomplishment dissolves.

[10134-10178] Voice 13 (Patrul): They practice during sessions, forget between. This old man says—the secret samaya is ALL THE TIME! Day and night, awake and dream, keep the guru in your mind. Not as burden—as recognition.

[10134-10178] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The yi-dam is your own enlightened form. The guru is your own enlightened mind. To think of them with degenerate mind is to dissolve your own Buddhahood. The promise taken is the promise to recognize.

[10134-10178] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I think of my teacher when I wake, when I sleep, when I work. Not obsession—recognition. He taught me the nature (rang bzhin) of mind. Now the teaching and the mind are one.

[10134-10178] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. gsang ba'i gsum (secret's three): phyi—lta sgom spyod (view, meditate, conduct), nang—yi dam gyi lha (yi-dam deity), gsang—bla ma dang mched lcam (guru and siblings). Precise analysis: yid kyi las 'khyal (mind's karma wandering) creates the condition for degeneration even without physical action.

[10134-10178] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Day and night, the mind rests in the guru. Not as object—as nature. This is the secret samaya that completes all others.

[10134-10178] Voice 22 (Drolo): DAY AND NIGHT? ALWAYS? The heruka's mind is ALWAYS recognition! Not sometimes! Not during practice! ALWAYS! See through time!

[10179-10224] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus, guarding twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, mind distinctions is this distinctive Dharma. From Consequence: guru Buddha worship basis, Dharma Sangha yi-dam, vajra sky-goers, gathering worship not cease. Guru characteristics seeing, praise worship complete. Women not disparage, anger not be. Aggregates not disparage, yi-dam rely. Mandala, mantra, deity, mudra reliance proper. Faithful gathering not break, virtuous mind not disturb. Discipline-possessed samaya dwell.

[10179-10224] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Twenty-seven. Complete. Stop. The twenty-seven are the complete mandala. Body nine, speech nine, mind nine. Guard them not as rules but as recognition. The guru is the center. All else radiates.

[10179-10224] Voice 13 (Patrul): Twenty-seven samayas! They count them on their fingers! This old man says—remember one: don't forget your nature. The twenty-seven keep themselves.

[10179-10224] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The twenty-seven samayas are the twenty-seven deities of the mandala. Body deities, speech deities, mind deities. Guard the mandala, and the deity manifests. Break the mandala, and the deity departs.

[10179-10224] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): Twenty-seven windows in the temple. Each looks out on the same mountain. Guard them all, or guard one well. The mountain remains.

[10179-10224] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Twenty-seven samayas: sku (body)—9, gsung (speech)—9, thugs (mind)—9. Total: nyer bdun (27). Distinctive Dharma—'di'i khyad par gyi chos—indicates unique teaching of this tantra.

[10179-10224] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The twenty-seven dissolve into one. The one is your awareness. Rest there, and the mandala is complete.

[10179-10224] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): TWENTY-SEVEN? ONE? speaks with fierce compassion See through the counting! The lion doesn't count! The lion ROARS! See through all samayas and find THE SAMAYA OF NO SAMAYA!
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. This is the treasury's heart.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
