, but do not think this is some external vow to be kept like a merchant's contract. Samaya is the bind that binds nothing—your own mind not breaking itself. You look for something to hold, something to protect, and all the while the vajra cross has always been right here, difficult to grasp because there's nothing to grasp.

, he tells you samaya is breaking free from deception. But what deception? You deceive yourself every moment, taking this moving mind as solid, taking these shifting thoughts as "you." Samaya is simply stopping that deception—recognizing your own mind has never been broken, never needed mending. Like a conch shell that is white inside and out, your nature has never been stained. The stain is the thought that you are stained.

He speaks of root and branch samayas at lines

[9719-9727]
—twenty-five branches, three roots of body, speech, and mind. You think "I must keep these!" and you make lists, you check them twice like a nervous householder. Foolish! The root samaya is simply this: not abandoning the view, not abandoning your own nature. Everything else grows from that like branches from a living tree. If you cut the root, what use are the branches?

[9745-9756]
, he speaks of the teacher and the student. You think the teacher is outside you, some glorious being to be worshipped from afar. And you think you are the poor student, lacking, needing. But look—teacher and student are mind's own display, siblings of one vajra family. The teacher appears because of your karma, your connection, your own mind's ripeness. The teacher is your own wisdom appearing in form to meet you. Do you see?

The vajra siblings at lines

[9757-9763]
—general, close, mixed, extremely mixed—you look for these categories like a scholar counting sand grains. Closer than close! When you enter the mandala together, when you share one vase, one lamp, one empowerment—this is not about the ritual objects. It is your own mind recognizing itself in another. The mandala is not painted on cloth. It is the expanse of your own awareness.

[9764-9765]
, he warns seven objects become strict. You hear "strict" and you tighten up, you become rigid with rules. But "strict" here means natural, unyielding, like the sky that holds all clouds but is never moved by them. Honor all as teacher—this means do not divide. Do not say "this one is worthy, that one is not." Every appearance is the teacher's face showing you your own mind.

So you ask, "How do I keep samaya?" You keep it by not keeping it. You protect it by not protecting it. Let your mind rest as it is, and samaya keeps itself. This is the great secret Longchenpa points to. Do you understand? Samaya is not a chain to bind you. It is the recognition that you were never bound.

[9766-9773]
Four gurus: yourself engaging dharmas' guide-guru, samaya and vows giving empowerment-guru, instructions extracting oral transmission-guru! From that: "To gurus also four purposes: general, guide, samaya empowerment, oral transmission guru."

[9774-9785]
Guru and student's definitive term also from that: "Definitive term thus: not knowing, knowing-liberation purpose—learn (*slob*); Great Perfection meaning engaging—guide (*dpon*). Student's definitive term thus: non-distracted manner listening—learn (*slob*); instruction vessel becoming—student (*ma*). Thus meaning-fulfilled guru-student properly dwell equally in the ground. Possessing samaya, it is thus."

Do you see? Guru isn't someone outside—you're both learning and guiding yourself! The student who listens without distraction becomes the vessel. The guru who points to your nature is your own recognition! Emaho!

[9820-9835]
. He speaks of early signs of deterioration—unhappiness arising, diseases, epidemics, spirits and misleaders. You feel these and you panic. "My samaya is broken!" you cry. But look—are these not just mind's own display? Sickness and suffering arise from the thought that something is wrong. The fever is not the problem. The thought "I have a fever and this is bad"—that is the real fever.

[9826-9835]
, he lists terrible consequences—killing sentient beings, going to hell, losing sight, leprosy, thieves, punishment, death of children and wife, enemies rising. You read this and fear grips your heart. But understand: these are not punishments from some angry deity. These are the natural results of believing in separation, of grasping at self and other. When you break samaya, you break the recognition of your own nature. And when that recognition is lost, of course hell appears! Hell is not a place below the earth. Hell is the mind that grasps at "me" and "mine."

But then, you ask, "Can it be repaired?" At lines

[9836-9859]
, Longchenpa gives you hope. Three methods he teaches. For body deterioration—scripture and ganacakra, three circles correctly done. You think this means elaborate rituals, expensive offerings. Foolish! The scripture is the recognition of your own nature. The ganacakra is feeding all beings with the understanding that they are not separate from you. The three circles—doer, deed, and done-to—are empty from the start. To "correctly do" means to do without the doer.

For speech deterioration at lines

[9843-9849]
—lamp rituals, confess-repair recitations. You want to chant a hundred times and be free. But speech is purified when you recognize that the words you speak are empty resounding, like an echo in a valley. Who is confessing? What is there to repair? The confession itself dissolves when you see the confessor has no substance.

And for mind deterioration at lines

[9850-9859]
—offer substance to the teacher, offer wealth-accumulation. You think this means gold and silver, horses and cattle. No! Offer your thoughts. Offer your grasping. Offer the very mind that thinks "I need to offer." When you offer everything, what remains? That remainder is the dharmakaya, and that is the only offering worth making.

[9860-9866]
, he speaks of the protection method. Fault and quality seen with mindfulness and awareness, pure continuum bound. You hear "bind" and you want to tie something up. But this binding is like binding space with space. Mindfulness is not remembering. It is not forgetting. Awareness is not watching. It is the natural clarity that has always been present. Samaya is protected when you do not protect it, when you let it be as it is for even one aeon without abandoning it—meaning, without abandoning your own nature.

At lines

[9867-9871]
, he says the student should protect what they do not know. You think this means blind faith. No! It means protect the not-knowing itself. Do not cover it with concepts. Let the not-knowing be naked, and in that nakedness, wisdom appears. The teacher's command is not an order from outside. It is your own deepest nature calling you home. Will you listen?

[9872-9878]
Listen here, practitioner! Knowing empowerment and oral instruction's occasion, knowing view as vast, knowing meditation's continuity great, knowing dharmatā profound, knowing samsara as unmixed, knowing abiding in passed grounds, knowing individual and general dharma and dharmi's characteristics—this is how you hold samaya!

[9879-9885]
Also from that: "This is protection method: knowing one distinction's distinction, superior protection through ten distinctions, less from that one. Samaya king engages thus." Do you see? One knowing becomes ten, ten protect the one. Don't count—recognize!

[9886-9896]
Now body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained. From *Thal-'gyur*: "Empowerment-depending samaya explained; though particular expressions hard to fathom, summarized: body, speech, mind—yoga body-speech-mind applied. Object guru vajra sibling; protection sphere distinguishes; commitment body and empowerment gathered; vajra secret place held."

[9897-9898]
Body samaya—outer, inner, secret.
