[10900-10908]
Second: common vehicle path practiced and this preliminary trained and objective mind ones' view meditation conduct result practiced time arising possible, error and non-error limb knowing explained, from Hundred Sixteen. Emaho!

[10900-10908]
. Like a master jeweler examining precious gems, we must understand the nature of these manifestations.

The root text [10906] says the essence is "the abiding nature as the support of all phenomena beyond sorrow." You must realize: these kayas are not statues in a temple, remote and separate from you! They are your own nature displaying itself. Like fire that is both heat and light inseparable, the kayas are the natural expression of dharmata.

Line 10908 gives the etymology: "stainless self-perfect great zangthal." Zangthal means unobstructed, penetrating everywhere! Think of sunlight streaming through a window—it fills the room completely, leaving no corner dark. So does the stainless nature penetrate all phenomena.

The text distinguishes the three kayas

[10910-10912]
: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya. But listen carefully! In the Great Perfection, these are not merely results to be attained later—they are the path's own appearances. Like a dreamer who realizes he is dreaming, the dream becomes the path to awakening.

Line 10914 explains: "According to this Great Perfection system, the three kayas are considered as path appearances." This is profound! The very appearances you see right now—if recognized—are the kayas. Your ordinary perception is actually the three kayas in disguise, like a poor man who does not know he wears a jewel in his hair.

Line 10916 clarifies: "Dharmakaya is self-appearance." Whatever dharmas exist, as long as mind exists to perceive them, this is the path. As long as kayas exist, as long as body exists—these are path appearances, not the final ultimate. Do not mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself!

When the essence of practice matures and reaches its measure

[10919-10923]
, we arrive at "the appearance of exhaustion"—approaching dissolution into kadag. Like ice melting back into water, all appearances naturally return to their source.

Line 10926 speaks of Lhungrub's appearances: "From the appearance of spontaneous presence, kayas, pure lands, and teachers appear." This is not creation from nothing! It is like reflections in a mirror—the mirror does not create the reflections, yet they clearly appear.

The signs of having accomplished the kayas are then described

[10935-10967]
: "Whoever has reached the measure of the kayas—to that fortunate being, these signs appear." When Chokyi Kaya is practiced, others cannot see the body; the yogin plays freely within himself. This is not mere invisibility—it is that the yogin's body has become indivisible from space itself!

Emaho!

[10968-11017]
manifest as powers: flying through space, passing through mountains, diving under earth, floating on water without sinking. But listen—if you lack confidence in the inseparability of space and awareness, these become mere sorcery!

The nirmanakaya signs

[11018-11025]
are even more amazing—spontaneous teachings flowing from your mouth, understanding texts you never studied, speaking words of Dharma that accord with beings' capacities. This is truly the lion's roar of speech!

See the bodily signs

[11026-11043]
: strength surpassing youth, grey hair turning black, wrinkles smoothing like a field after rain. And compassion

[11026-11041]
—dwelling sixty-eight thousand years for others' benefit, then manifesting in countless world-systems, all while absorbed in ka-dag.

You may wonder

[11042-11056]
about the five hundred years of self-benefit—there is no contradiction! For self-benefit one may dwell five hundred years; for others' benefit, countless aeons. Both are possible without conflict. Like a tree that grows for centuries yet gives shade immediately, time is not an obstacle for the realized.

Like water dissolving into water, like butter into butter, like space into space

[11044-11057]
—previously absent, now arising from the depths for beings' welfare, willing to give body and limbs.

When these arise, you have touched the nirmanakaya. This is not mere imagination—it is your own nature manifesting! Like a lamp whose flame naturally rises upward, these signs arise naturally from recognition of your true face.

The text warns

[11047-11056]
—so your own nature dissolves into itself without any grasping at essence. This is not annihilation; it is spontaneous liberation! The waves return to the ocean; the rays return to the sun.

The inner awareness signs

[11056-11081]
That person obstacle arisen signs much, time water mandala sitting, chin tree stick sixteen finger-width pressing, body sandalwood oil anointed, outer inner things coarse meditated certainly clears. Mara's blessing emanated that too examined reflection second appearing, consecrated water body washed phat recited, emptiness sky-like meditation clears. Other yogin whoever dharmata not realized realized thinking, joy excitement demon entered, all empty realized wide entered karma and ripening not harm holding.

[11057-11074]
are: bliss, non-attachment to worldly concerns, all appearances shining as light, seeing kayas in light without cessation, body at ease without grasping, mind one-pointed, awareness naturally relaxed, unfabricated meditation arising in your being.

This is your inheritance, fortunate child! Not something to be achieved from outside, but your own nature recognizing itself. Like a prince who discovers he has been wearing the crown all along, the realization dawns that you were never separate from the three kayas.

Emaho!

[11058-11077]
: one who possesses these signs but lacks confidence in dharmadhatu and rigpa—the elements will self-exhaust but this is not true liberation. Do not be like a merchant who displays his goods but has no wealth!

Emaho!

[11075-11087]
. Like a vajra chain, awareness appears as your own appearing. Through the guru's pith instructions, previously unrecognized awareness becomes recognized.

Threefold rigpa

[11082-11107]
Flesh-eating dakinis prophecy, gatherings meeting etc. small siddhi achieved, dakinis speaking ear near formless voice good bad dharma teaching etc. coming, time clear knowledge subtle arising pride possessing exists. These all mara's obstacles knowing, generation completion abiding or ganachakra great accumulated wish-prayer made, emptiness meditation liberates. From Rangshar: "Mouth words engaging depth not realized lunatic-like arose, obstacle demon arisen, ganachakra great given practice. Or memory declined arose, display not seen signs, three roots reversing."

[11088-11096]
: base-establishing rigpa is the natural state beyond good and bad; path-appearing rigpa goes by various names—mind-nature, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, beyond intellect, dharmakaya; lhaktong rigpa sees the vajra chain's kaya directly, free from conceptual investigation.

The character

[11097-11103]
is this: naturally clear, naked, spontaneously perfected—just this! The result is liberation into ka-dag's spontaneity through practicing just this. Not practicing something else, not going somewhere else—resting in what is already present!

See the signs

[11104-11124]
: wherever you direct attention, awareness enters there; body follows like a shadow; you can transform others' faith; conceptual fixation ceases. One who recognizes this directly dwells in the self-liberated ground. Like a garuda circling higher with each wing-beat, recognition deepens naturally.

The text quotes

[11108-11132]
"Dakinis prophecy arising, experience view, placed in meditation." Thus. Prophecy two: dakinis self-controlled, self dakinis' controlled two. Self-controlled dakinis all actions achieved, actions completed. Self-controlled dakinis method: spiritual son, practice time prophecy arising, to that attachment joy mind not arisen, to that truly held, self-controlled dakinis called. That anything showing not able. Wisdom pure dakinis world not arising.

[11125-11135]
: "Body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness." These are not fairy tales! They are the natural display when rigpa matures.

Emaho!

[11133-11154]
Flesh-eating action dakinis world come, some practitioner place wandering, that form not clearly appearing thus liberation not able. True path other shore going for, dakinis all to me life essence once gave. Self dakinis' controlled oneself too prophecy that truly held, prophecy that always held, body non-attached conduct doing, result is is not extremes transcended saying, prophecy that following holding is near obstacle demon arisen, that time mara's deception knowing.

Emaho!

[11136-11143]
arise these signs and measures: body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness.

The five senses

[11144-11161]
dissolve into their natureless state—this is the measure! Now the text distinguishes signs more precisely

[11162-11181]
: outer body signs, inner awareness signs, and how they combine. When you are truly confident in ka-dag's realization, no more births in samsara! Signs: body without parasites, hair and nails not growing.
