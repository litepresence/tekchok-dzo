First has preliminaries and main introduction: preliminaries are preparing a retreat house half-open with sunlight's rays, crystal mirror stainless—a preliminary. From the Introduction Ornament Tantra: "The retreat place half-open, hole with sun's rays, mirror clear showing, light display seen outward." There, through Vajrasattva heart mirror's symbol introduction showing previous occurrence, in this Jambudvipa, from the Turning Samsara's Wheel Jewel Secret Tantra: "Holder of five buddhas' lineage, crystal stupa five-tiered, five wisdoms' nature, five sky-lineage holder, spreading in unseen sky, unmixed colors individually clear."

! Just as a crystal is pure by nature, clear inside and out without obstruction, so is the dharmakaya - the true nature of your own mind!

The crystal's inner light represents prajna, the life-force wisdom, while the outer clear light shows how emanation bodies arise. Do you see? The crystal itself demonstrates the ground wisdom, the primordial nature that abides unchanged!

Like a crystal reflecting all colors yet remaining pure and empty, your own awareness recognizes all appearances while itself remaining unstained. The lamp arrangements from the tantra show this directly - through example, through signs, through meaning itself!

Samantabhadra's appearance is like a mirror, dear one! When you look into a clear mirror, what do you see? Your own face! So too when you look into the nature of mind - you see the face of your own primordial wisdom, clear and unobstructed!

Do not seek elsewhere! The crystal-like rigpa is already present, spontaneously abiding, non-ceasing, without direction. This is the direct introduction to your own nature. Recognize it now!

Through example you understand the meaning. Through signs you gain confidence. Through deciding the essence, the three primordial wisdoms established in the base ripen as fruit. Without seeking, you see the result yourself!

Emaho!

[9585-9616]
! Like white light demonstrating compassion inseparable from itself - this is how the three kayas abide as one bindu!

Look here! When sunlight strikes a crystal, rays extend outward, yet the light arises from the crystal itself. So too does base-appearances arise from the base - but because of non-recognition, ignorance arises as knowable obscuration!

Samantabhadra transcends the base through wisdom's sense power! In a single moment, distinctions separate; in a single moment, complete Buddhahood! Before all Buddhas, like a great grandfather, already enlightened!

Dear practitioner, understand this: Buddhas without cause, without beginning or end, with a single wisdom eye unstained! The liberation base of Samantabhadra is demonstrated here. When you recognize base-appearance as it arises, you are liberated!

Yet sentient beings do not recognize their own appearances as self-appearances. Like various colored cloths placed over a crystal, like white light appearing as various colors - so does awareness arise as various delusions through the habit-continuum of rising and sleeping!

Do not be confused! These appearances are your own wisdom's display. Recognize them directly, without grasping. Rest in the nature as it is!

Emaho!

Wisdom body entered body's hollow, holding fourfold rigpa heart abiding, and pervading all sentient beings—shown. This is natural delusion-mode introduction. Delusion condition-arisen like crystal light, various things appearing like crystal light, appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal, inexhaustible increase-decrease absent like crystal light—understand these and properly join sign-meaning.

[9634-9665]
Sentient beings' liberation mode sign-meaning: From Blazing Lamp—"Base itself ripens result, knowing wisdom. Wisdom ripens as body, essence dharma body that, ripens as wisdom dharma body." From heart five wisdoms three-tiered, liver wind and wisdom's resonance two meeting, potency-mind arising, potency-base dissolving unmoving abiding example. Inner light outer-radiating white mind example. Sixth called mind. Five lights wisdom example. Base-holding rigpa. Mind and wisdom two example introduction thus established. Intermediate state introduction sound-light-ray three, Vajrasattva's inner channel-vein root introduction and so forth—on crystal establish certain knowledge, join yogin's face and knowledge, make certain and practice.

[9666-9696]
Liberation result mode: though inner-clear kadag liberation base self-arisen essence body clear, outer-clear five lights and white two mixed introduction, this having wisdom is crucial. Path wisdom or those wishing no wisdom, Madhyamaka extreme non-abiding, or us Dzogchen kadag no wisdom wishers—even if delusion purified from root, two bodies unceased arising, wisdom must exist in expanse. Five lights white mixed is mirror wisdom; white separately arising is sambhogakaya emanating nirmanakaya example. These are two purities possessing all aspects knowing buddhahood introduction.

[9697-9712]
Buddhas' parinirvana means sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya dissolving into dharmakaya—crystal sun's condition separated, original base kadag held unmoving unconfused abiding, essence inseparable thus ka-liberation, yet through recognizing-not recognizing difference, all as wisdom body alone abiding is called all-knowing. Especially wisdom two-possessing.
