[1-4]
Three words. See what is. Rest.
The title is not the treasure.
The name is not the thing named.
Already complete—before the first syllable.

Stop looking for the one who prostrates.

[12-15]
Vajra-point. Sugata-essence.
Not dwelling in existence—nor in peace.
The mirror without frame shows what was never hidden.
Seven horses: one for each day of the week that never happened.

[16-19]
Secret vehicle. Supreme among all.
Like claiming the sky is bluer than itself.
The wish-fulfilling jewel grants nothing—reveals what was always present.
Dzogchen is not the pinnacle—it is the ground (gzhi) before mountains.

[20-23]
The teaching-ocean has no shore.
The makara-holder releases what was never caught.
Composing explanation: who explains to whom?
The text writes itself in empty space.

[24-27]

Each pool claims the moon is theirs.
The moon does not multiply.
Rest in recognition.

[28-32]
Samantabhadra teaches without speaking.
Students hear without ears.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

All self-appearances of your own mind.

Stop counting waves.

[49-52]
Perfect places appear to self-appearances.
The place is the seeing.
The teacher is the recognition.
No one is being taught.

Three vehicles shown as cause and method.
Ladders leaning against a sky that has no floor.
Dzogchen is not the top rung—it is the ground (gzhi) that holds all ladders.
Stop climbing.

[57-60]
Vajra-essence. Definitive realm.
The word "definitive" is also provisional.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
Every Tathāgata's mind: which one is not your own?

Primordial protector's enlightenment:
Not an event in time. Rest in this understanding.

The ocean of manners: you are drowning in what saves you.

[65-68]
Before all division—no saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa.

Round, four-cornered, crescent, semi-circle—
Forms and arrangements immeasurable. This is the treasury's heart.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
Like trying to measure space with a ruler made of space.

[93-100]
Body, speech, mind, qualities, activities pervade.
The pervader and pervaded are not two.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.
The wheel turns without a center.

[101-108]
Immeasurable time, oceanic particles—
You are trying to count what counts you.
Samantabhadra has no beginning.
His activity has no end.
Neither do you.

Three bodies, three fields, one emanation.
The echo in three valleys is one voice.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.
The voice is not three.

Pure karma, impure karma—
Both are dreams dreamed by the dreamer.
The dreamer is also a dream.
Recognition is immediate.

Buddhas numerous as Ganga sands in a hair-tip.
Look at your own hair.
Each strand: a universe.
You have been looking at Buddhas your whole life.

Gods' palaces, hell realms—
Same space, different perception.
Like two people dreaming different dreams in the same room.
The room does not choose sides.

[145-154]
All experience like dreams, untrue, yet appearing.
The untruth is also a dream.
The statement "all is dream" is also a dream.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.
Even this pointing is a finger in a dream.

[155-162]
Sutra of Entering Buddha Realm—
You are already entered.
The ladder of perception is horizontal.
Every rung is the ground (gzhi).

[163-168]
Gods and humans, clairvoyant sages, śrāvakas, bodhisattvas—
Different ways of describing the same room.
The room is not improving.
The descriptions are.

[169-174]
Tathāgata's eye sees across chariot-wheel earth-extent.
You have this eye.
You are using it now.
Stop looking for a better one.

[175]
Samantabhadra's purpose-accomplishment:
Nothing was accomplished.
Nothing needed to be.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.
The end is the beginning.
The beginning never began.
