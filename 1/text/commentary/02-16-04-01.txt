Listen well, dear one! When yellow increases from reality, all qualities arise—like a wish-fulfilling jewel fulfilling every need and desire! This is the great increase of reality, arising various qualities to liberate all beings.

[1610-1621]
Three powers—attend! Red power of reality establishes without seeking—power of dharmakaya essence! Like yellow gold needing no seeking, the great mandala of ground-appearance needs no searching for its power. Reality's basis is power complete!

[1622-1636]
Four fiercenesses—mark this! Green reality fierce—all fierce aspects complete! The basis itself pure as reality, arising without obstruction! Like wind's emanation moving without obstruction, from great ground-appearance pristine cognition arises without obstruction. What need for pristine cognition? Activity pure essence! Thus basis' essence is activity mandala complete!

[1637-1637]
Four aspects for beings' time completion: First, pacifying—all beings' elements are self-arisen pristine cognition in the heart, white self-light of pacifying resonance abiding in the cit-ta mandala, soft and supple, white light-rays spreading like body, speech, and mind, all-pervading pristine cognition possessing crown ornament, abiding like pacifying mandala.
