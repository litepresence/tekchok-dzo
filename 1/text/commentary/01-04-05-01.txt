Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me: "What is the false conventional?" I showed him his own face in a frozen puddle. "Is that you?" I asked. He nodded. "But it's frozen," I said. "Upside down. Flat. Is that you?" He stared for a long time. Finally he laughed. "I see," he said. "But I also don't see." This old practitioner nodded. That's the beginning. The false conventional is all imputed appearances arranged by intellect—the world you create through conceptual construction. You name things, you categorize, you create a reality through conceptual construction. And it works! You navigate, you survive, you communicate. But when you believe this construction is truly real, truly existing out there independent of your mind, you are trapped in the false conventional. Like mistaking a rope for a snake—you suffer fear where no danger exists.

[2849-2856]
All imputed appearances arranged by intellect—this is your everyday world. The table, the chair, the self, the other. All constructed by mind. All dependent on naming, on concepts, on agreement. This doesn't mean they don't function. The table holds your tea. The chair supports your body. But when you look for the "table-ness" in the parts, you can't find it. It's a convention, a name, a useful fiction. This is the false conventional. Not false as in "doesn't exist." False as in "doesn't exist the way it appears." Appearing as solid, permanent, independent. Actually being fluid, impermanent, dependent. This is the insight that liberates.

The eight similes appear again because they are crucial. Dream, magical display, city of gandharvas, reflection, echo, mirage, water-moon, magical creation. This hermit has experienced all eight. Has dreamed of falling and woken with his heart racing. Has seen rainbows in mountain mist and reached for them. Has heard his own echo in a canyon and answered back. Each time, the lesson deepens: appearance without inherent existence is the nature of all things. The dream functions while dreaming. The echo sounds real. The mirage shimmers like water. But none are what they seem. This is not disappointment. This is freedom. When you stop grasping at appearances as real, you can enjoy them without being bound by them.

[2862-2866]
The true conventional—white actions of virtue, collections of merit gathered through wisdom's samadhi—this is the path that leads toward recognition. It is still conventional, still conceptual, but it functions to bring you closer to the ultimate. Like using a thorn to remove a thorn, using a dream to wake from dreaming. This yogi spent years practicing virtue while grasping at virtue. His merit was like a seed planted in rocky soil—some growth, but shallow roots. Only when he released the grasping did the virtue bear full fruit. True conventional is not about the action itself. It's about the mind with which you perform it. Give without giver. Practice without practicer. Accumulate merit without accumulator.

[2867-2872]
The ultimate truth has two aspects too! The nominal ultimate is the emptiness you can point toward, the freedom from elaboration you can describe. It's like describing the taste of water to someone who has never drunk—possible up to a point, but never fully capturing the experience. The true ultimate is beyond even description—beyond beyond. This old practitioner spent decades seeking the true ultimate. A safe place. Finally realized: even safety is empty. Even refuge is empty. This is the ultimate refuge. Not a place. Not a state. Not an achievement. Just—this. Whatever this is. The nature of mind. The emptiness of all phenomena. Beyond words, beyond concepts, yet right here.

[2870-2872]
The inherent nature of dharmas, essence of emptiness, peaceful aspect beyond elaboration—this is not another world, not a place you go! It's the nature of this very world, this very moment, this very mind. Like the space inside a room—you don't go somewhere else to find it. It's what allows everything else to be. This hermit once searched for emptiness like it was a treasure hidden in a cave. Dug for years. Finally realized: the digging was happening in emptiness. The cave was empty. He was empty. The treasure was never hidden. It was never anywhere else. It was the nature of the search itself.

[2862-2869]
The path of virtue and wisdom—this is the conventional path toward ultimate realization. It's like building a staircase to reach the roof. Each step is real, each step supports the next, but no single step is the roof. And once you reach the roof, you don't need to carry the stairs with you. This yogi knows practitioners who have climbed halfway and think they've arrived. They build houses on the seventh step. Comfortable houses! But not the view from the roof. Don't stop halfway. Don't think the path is the goal. The path leads to the goal. But the goal is not somewhere else. It's the recognition of what has always been true.

[2867-2872]
Ultimate truth divided into nominal and true ultimate—this distinction matters for practitioners at different stages. Those new to the path need the nominal ultimate—a concept of emptiness to work with, a description of freedom from elaboration. Like a map to a destination. But the map is not the territory. Eventually, you must put down the map and walk. The true ultimate is the walking itself, the destination itself, the one who walks and arrives—seen through as empty, yet fully functioning. Don't get stuck with the map. Don't worship the finger. Look at the moon. Drink the water. This is the way.

[2849-2856]
This practitioner returns to wrong conventional again because it's where we all live. The world of imputed appearances—tables, chairs, selves, others, good, bad, past, future—this is the world of confusion. Not because it's wrong to have these concepts, but because we believe they refer to inherently existing things. We believe the name is the thing, the concept is the reality. This is the fundamental error that creates all suffering. Seeing through it is liberation. But seeing through doesn't mean eliminating. You still use concepts. You still name things. You just don't believe the names capture the reality. You use the raft to cross, then leave it. You use the thorn to remove the thorn, then discard both.

[2857-2861]
The eight similes from the Root of Wisdom—this hermit has memorized them, recited them, meditated on them. Each one reveals a different facet of the same truth. Dream shows how vivid unreality can be. Mirage shows how we chase what isn't there. Echo shows how we respond to our own projections. Water-moon shows how beautiful appearances can be without existing as they appear. This old practitioner keeps these similes like tools in a pouch, bringing out the one that fits the moment. When attachment arises, he remembers the dream. When aversion arises, he remembers the mirage. When pride arises, he remembers the echo. Each simile is medicine for a specific poison.

[2862-2869]
Virtuous actions, collections of merit, wisdom's samadhi—this is the path of accumulation and preparation. You gather what you need for the journey, like a traveler filling a pack before a long trek. But don't overpack! This yogi has seen practitioners carrying so many practices, so many commitments, so many methods that they can barely walk. The path becomes a burden. Merit becomes a weight. Remember: the goal is lightness, not accumulation. The path of virtue is meant to free you, not bind you. Practice what you can practice well. One practice done fully is better than a hundred done partially. One step taken with awareness is better than a hundred taken in distraction.

[2870-2872]
The ultimate truth is not found by abandoning the conventional. This is a crucial point! Some think they must reject the world to find emptiness. But emptiness is the nature of the world, not a separate reality. Like the space in a cup—the space isn't found by breaking the cup. The cup and space depend on each other. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. This is not philosophy. This is the nature of your experience right now. Look at your hand. It appears solid. But it's empty of inherent existence. Look at your mind. It appears continuous. But it's a stream of moments, each empty. The conventional and ultimate are not two. They are one reality viewed in two ways. This is the profound teaching of the two truths.

Emaho! Conventional and ultimate, false and true, nominal and real—words pointing to what cannot be worded. Drink the teachings fully, then digest them completely. What remains is not a teaching. It's what was always there. It's who you always were. It's the nature of mind, clear and luminous, empty and cognizant, beyond all description yet vividly present. Don't seek it elsewhere. Don't think it's hidden. It's not hidden. It's not secret. It's right here. Right now. In the midst of your confusion, your suffering, your seeking. Especially there. Emaho!
