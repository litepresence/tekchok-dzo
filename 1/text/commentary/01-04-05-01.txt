Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me: "What is the false conventional?" I showed him his own face in a frozen puddle. "Is that you?" I asked. He nodded. "But it's frozen," I said. "Upside down. Flat. Is that you?" He stared for a long time. Finally he laughed. "I see," he said. "But I also don't see." This old practitioner nodded. That's the beginning. The false conventional is all imputed appearances arranged by intellect—the world you create through conceptual construction. You name things, you categorize, you create a reality through conceptual construction. And it works! You navigate, you survive, you communicate. But when you believe this construction is truly real, truly existing out there independent of your mind, you are trapped in the false conventional. Like mistaking a rope for a snake—you suffer fear where no danger exists.

The eight similes of illusion appear again because they are crucial. Dream, magical display, city of gandharvas, reflection, echo, mirage, water-moon, magical creation. This hermit has experienced all eight. Has dreamed of falling and woken with his heart racing. Has seen rainbows in mountain mist and reached for them. Has heard his own echo in a canyon and answered back. Each time, the lesson deepens: appearance without inherent existence is the nature of all things. The dream functions while dreaming. The echo sounds real. The mirage shimmers like water. But none are what they seem. This is not disappointment. This is freedom. When you stop grasping at appearances as real, you can enjoy them without being bound by them.

The true conventional—white actions of virtue, collections of merit gathered through wisdom's samadhi—this is the path that leads toward recognition. It is still conventional, still conceptual, but it functions to bring you closer to the ultimate. Like using a thorn to remove a thorn, using a dream to wake from dreaming. This yogi spent years practicing virtue while grasping at virtue. His merit was like a seed planted in rocky soil—some growth, but shallow roots. Only when he released the grasping did the virtue bear full fruit. True conventional is not about the action itself. It's about the mind with which you perform it. Give without giver. Practice without practicer. Accumulate merit without accumulator.

The ultimate truth has two aspects too! The nominal ultimate is the emptiness you can point toward, the freedom from elaboration you can describe. It's like describing the taste of water to someone who has never drunk—possible up to a point, but never fully capturing the experience. The true ultimate is beyond even description—beyond beyond. This old practitioner spent decades seeking the true ultimate. A safe place. Finally realized: even safety is empty. Even refuge is empty. This is the ultimate refuge. Not a place. Not a state. Not an achievement. Just—this. Whatever this is. The nature of mind. The emptiness of all phenomena. Beyond words, beyond concepts, yet right here.
