See how below these visions, forms dawn with colors and shapes abiding for moments

[5192-5193]
? When these cease, the five wisdom shapes dawn [5193] - mirror-like shapes like spots in the eye [5194], increasing in excellent color [5195], with many lines dawning to the eye [5196]. This is the preliminary measure arriving [5197].

Then the net of equality dawns halfway [5198], purifying the wind completely [5199], completing the preliminary pure vision [5200]. Then heaps of flowers dawn [5201] through effortful gazing [5202], purifying the preliminary with thousand-petaled lotuses [5203]. Then weapon-like forms dawn [5204] with unfabricated nature [5205], completing the preliminary with wheels and various forms [5206]. Finally, the palace of dharmadhatu wisdom dawns [5207].

Thus practitioner, do not be distracted! These visions are your own nature displaying itself. Emaho!

[5210-5212]
. Beyond that, experience increases vision even further [5213].

Listen! During this preliminary time [5214], conceptuality's difference raises and ceases as signs [5215]. Then the vision of awareness's self-essence dawns [5216]! Light points dawn like hanging cords gathering as one [5217], then two points connect - method and discriminating-awareness fully purify [5218], then five points connect as the five wisdoms enter [5219]. Direct connection of points - not different, merely small existence [5220] - experience increases beyond this [5221].

The Thalgyur declares: "The five-colored light, victory-banner and boat-part vision, seeing the field boat-only measure"

[5223-5225]
. The Self-Arising Tantra proclaims: "Seeing one's own face thus, upper joint four fingers apart, separate person of good capacity - how could they enter samsara?"

[5227-5231]
.

Dear practitioner, whatever boat-part forms dawn accomplish emanation qualities

[5232-5233]
. Whatever fields dawn are the same heaps

[5234-5235]
. When outer visions cease, sixteen moments

[5236-5238]
- thus it is said.

Third, the awareness measure-arrive vision shows general manner [5240]. From explaining nature particularly [5241], first: points each dawn in half the body, purifying nirmanakaya [5243], then the body itself dawns each, directly seeing dharmata [5244], then body becomes five-by-five fathers and mothers as sambhogakaya wisdom measure-arrives [5245], then individual heaps with mandala vision [5246].

Thus, dear one, these are your own face - do not seek elsewhere! Emaho!
