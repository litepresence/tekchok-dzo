[19421-19440]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Second, light ray thread appear, that from subtle and, move and, flicker and, stable and, fire also appear. Third, bindu rim arise. That from upward-stand and, side arise etc. also arise.

[19421-19430]
This old practitioner watched candle flames in a dark room. The flame flickered, moved, yet was always the same flame. The bindu appearances are like this—moving, changing, yet always the same nature. The movement is not the bindu changing; it is the display becoming more clear.

[19430-19440]
Voice 20 proclaims: Third, fruit self-ripen bindu three: from Sun-Moon Union—fruit self-ripen bindu three: light ripen bindu, wisdom ripen bindu, awareness ripen bindu. From that: light ripen bindu upright abide, very clear not-mixed rainbow like, this familiarized appearance also see.

[19435-19445]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The fruit bindu is the completion of the path—not something new appearing, but the recognition of what has always been. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life. The glasses don't appear; you simply recognize what was already there.

[19440-19450]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The bindu stages—upright, side-arise, etc.—are natural unfoldings, not achievements. Like a flower opening to the sun—it doesn't try to open; it opens naturally when conditions are right. Your recognition is the sun; let the bindu open naturally.

[19445-19455]
This old hermit offers final teaching on bindu: Don't be attached to any particular bindu appearance. Some see spheres, some see lights, some see nothing—all can be advanced or deluded. The measure is recognition, not appearance. Rest in that, and all appearances become wisdom's play.

[19450-19460]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: The fruit bindu is not a reward for good practice! It is the natural result of recognition. Like fruit ripening on a tree—not created by the ripening, but revealed by it. The bindu was always ripe; recognition simply tastes what was always sweet.

[19460-19470]
Between practice and realization, the vast middle way opens. The fruit bindu is neither caused by practice nor independent of it. Like a mirror reflecting a face—practice polishes the mirror, but the reflection is always possible. Recognition is the reflection seeing itself.

[19470-19480]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: The three fruit bindus—light ripen, wisdom ripen, awareness ripen—are three aspects of one completion. Like a gem showing three colors from three angles—one gem, many appearances. Don't favor one; recognize all.

[19480-19490]
This old practitioner once thought fruit bindu would be spectacular. He imagined rainbows, visions, celestial beings. When it came, it was simple—just ordinary awareness recognizing itself. The spectacular was the simplicity. The extraordinary was the ordinary known directly.

[19490-19500]
Voice 20 proclaims: The light ripen bindu upright abides like a rainbow—clear, vivid, not solid. This is the nature of all appearance when recognized. Not nothing, not something—vividly empty, emptily vivid. This is wisdom's own light.

[19500-19510]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The fruit bindu teaches that completion is not an end but a beginning. Not a destination but a recognition. Like waking from a dream—the waking doesn't destroy the dream; it simply sees the dream's nature.

[19510-19520]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals: The side-arising bindu shows that wisdom has no fixed position. It appears here, there, everywhere—yet remains unmoved. Like the sun reflected in many bowls of water—one sun, many reflections.

[19520-19530]
This old hermit watched a rainbow dissolve at sunset. Where did it go? Nowhere. It was never solid. So too with the fruit bindu—it appears to dissolve, yet was never something that could dissolve. This is the nature of completion: nothing completed, nothing incomplete.

[19530-19540]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who seek the fruit bindu as an experience! They chase their own tail. The bindu is the seeker, not the sought. The recognition is the fruit, not something recognized. Stop seeking. Start being.

[19540-19550]
Between seeking and finding, the vast middle way opens. The fruit bindu is found when seeking ceases. Not through effort, but through effortless recognition. Like finding a lost ring—it wasn't lost; you just stopped looking in the wrong place.

[19550-19560]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The fruit bindu appearances—upright, side-arise, etc.—are the final teachings of the bindu. They show that even completion has no fixed form. The path ends where it began—in recognition of what has never changed.

[19560-19570]
This old practitioner offers final word: The fruit bindu is your own face. You have never not seen it. The recognition is the fruit. The recognition is the path. The recognition is the basis. Three names for one reality—recognition.
