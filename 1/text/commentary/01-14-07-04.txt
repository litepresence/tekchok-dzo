[19421-19440]
Consequently...

[19421-19430]
An old vagabond...

[19430-19440]
Voice 20 proclaims: Third, fruit self-ripen bindu three: from Sun-Moon Union—fruit self-ripen bindu three: light ripen bindu, wisdom ripen bindu, awareness ripen bindu. From that: light ripen bindu upright abide, very clear not-mixed rainbow like, this familiarized appearance also see.

[19435-19445]
Recognize immediately.

[19440-19450]
Thus established...

[19445-19455]
This old hermit offers final teaching on bindu: Don't be attached to any particular bindu appearance. Some see spheres, some see lights, some see nothing—all can be advanced or deluded. The measure is recognition, not appearance. Rest in that, and all appearances become wisdom's play.

[19450-19460]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: The fruit bindu is not a reward for good practice! It is the natural result of recognition. Like fruit ripening on a tree—not created by the ripening, but revealed by it. The bindu was always ripe; recognition simply tastes what was always sweet.

[19460-19470]
Between practice and realization, the vast middle way opens. The fruit bindu is neither caused by practice nor independent of it. Like a mirror reflecting a face—practice polishes the mirror, but the reflection is always possible. Recognition is the reflection seeing itself.

[19470-19480]
The framework reveals...

[19480-19490]
This mountain dweller...

[19490-19500]
Voice 20 proclaims: The light ripen bindu upright abides like a rainbow—clear, vivid, not solid. This is the nature of all appearance when recognized. Not nothing, not something—vividly empty, emptily vivid. This is wisdom's own light.

[19500-19510]
See your own face.

[19510-19520]
Analysis proceeds...

[19520-19530]
This old hermit watched a rainbow dissolve at sunset. Where did it go? Nowhere. It was never solid. So too with the fruit bindu—it appears to dissolve, yet was never something that could dissolve. This is the nature of completion: nothing completed, nothing incomplete.

[19530-19540]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who seek the fruit bindu as an experience! They chase their own tail. The bindu is the seeker, not the sought. The recognition is the fruit, not something recognized. Stop seeking. Start being.

[19540-19550]
Between seeking and finding, the vast middle way opens. The fruit bindu is found when seeking ceases. Not through effort, but through effortless recognition. Like finding a lost ring—it wasn't lost; you just stopped looking in the wrong place.

[19550-19560]
Thus. We proceed...

[19560-19570]
This fool...
