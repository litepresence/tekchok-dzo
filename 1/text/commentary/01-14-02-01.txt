[17524-17532]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the nature of Dharmakaya. First, the nature: abiding as subtle primordial wisdom within original purity great, inner-luminous, spontaneously accomplished arise-basis. When deluded, placed in its expression, realized as singular mind-entity free from elaborations, experienced with taste. From that itself, two natural-state abiding modes: abiding at first basis, and abiding at delusion object. First nature and nature and compassion three as essence, nature, and compassion abide.

[17531-17538]
This old practitioner searched for Dharmakaya in mountain retreats, temples, and texts. Foolish! The Dharmakaya palace of unchanging changelessness abides clearly in the center of each citta. Self-arisen, self-clear. Where else would it be? Looking outside for what has never been separate is like a man searching for his own head.

[17533-17544]
Voice 20 proclaims: That also abides as essence-body. Dharma, enjoyment, emanation—three aspects of rain. Not divided, division nonexistent mode. Spontaneously accomplished, body-color and qualities mind-object nonexistent. Nature arises as light: white, red, yellow, green, blue—not marks, not signs. From compassion various arise. One as certain-nonexistent. Basis called because various appear.

[17545-17553]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. At delusion object, self-place and rest self-liberated. This is the great Dharmakaya. From Self-Arisen: Dharmakaya great primordial wisdom scripture. Characteristics: three forms. Essence, nature, compassion three. These are Dharmakaya characteristics.

[17554-17565]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis asks: where does this exist now? In the heart-center, glorious jewel precious secret treasury. From that: Dharmakaya palace changeless. Abiding clearly in each citta center. Empty primordial wisdom essence. Clear light essence. Self-arisen awareness essence. Three essences with Dharmakaya.

[17559-17571]
This old hermit laughed when he finally understood. Primordial wisdom meaning—realize without traversing path-ground. Expression-limit-free great Dharmakaya—abiding in all, realized by none. Mind nonexistent, consciousness nonexistent, ignorance nonexistent. Sometimes labeled as basis-abide primordial wisdom, sometimes Dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis. Nature one, reverse aspects spoken. Body and primordial wisdom without gathering or separation—this is the intention to know.

[17572-17583]
Second: definitive meaning. Profound and vast dharmas' essence gathered, called Dharmakaya. Third: divisions. Looking at original purity great meaning, nature completely pure, existing in body, adventitious stain-free supreme Dharmakaya—three aspects. Three bodies become nine when divided. From Self-Arisen: though body is inconceivable, gathered into three.

[17583-17593]
What? Dharmakaya—transcended from sign object. Sambhogakaya—transcended from grasped object. Nirmanakaya—transcended from attachment object. These are Dharmakaya's three. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya is awareness.

[17590-17605]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Dharma appears as object. Body is unceasing awareness nature. Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is five lights. Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is eye sense-power seeing unceasingly. Dharmakaya object is completely pure sky. Dharmakaya abode is citta. Dharmakaya path is jewel crystal duct. Sambhogakaya also has three. CUT THROUGH NOW! Stop dividing what has never been separate!

[17606-17617]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Sambhogakaya-of-Dharmakaya is unceasing appearance of five primordial wisdoms, lucidly abiding. Sambhogakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is five bindu forms with path. Sambhogakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is awareness arising at five doors' knowledge objects. Sambhogakaya abode is avadhuti. Sambhogakaya path is right small tip.

[17615-17629]
Nirmanakaya also three: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Thus: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya is two lamps. Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is seeing five lights. Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is individual self-awareness where five afflictions arise. Nirmanakaya abode is brain. Nirmanakaya path is eye. Nirmanakaya object is delusion-appearance.

[17630-17643]
This old practitioner watched a candle flame. Is it one or many? The flame appears single, yet countless sparks arise from it. The three kayas are like this—neither one nor many, neither separate nor identical. Dharmakaya has no mind or afflictions. Divisions of body three: Sambhogakaya's Nirmanakaya and Nirmanakaya's Nirmanakaya—are these contradictory to five-door consciousness and afflictions? Not contradictory. At time of consciousness and afflictions self, awareness self-expression exists—thus spoken. Consciousness and afflictions are not entity Nirmanakaya.

[17636-17643]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The three kayas are not three separate places—they are one wisdom showing three faces. Like the same sun reflected in three different bowls of water. The reflections are different; the sun is one.

[17640-17650]
Voice 20 proclaims: The divisions of Dharmakaya into three, then nine, then countless—are pedagogical devices, not ultimate truths. Like a teacher using many examples to explain one point. Don't confuse the examples with the point.

[17645-17655]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The three kayas are your own nature's display. Not somewhere else. Not someone else. Right here, right now, in your own experience. Recognize this, and every perception becomes kaya appearance.
