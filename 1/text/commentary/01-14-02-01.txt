In this manner...

[17531-17538]
This old man once...

[17533-17544]
Voice 20 proclaims: That also abides as essence-body. Dharma, enjoyment, emanation—three aspects of rain. Not divided, division nonexistent mode. Spontaneously accomplished, body-color and qualities mind-object nonexistent. Nature arises as light: white, red, yellow, green, blue—not marks, not signs. From compassion various arise. One as certain-nonexistent. Basis called because various appear.

[17545-17553]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. At delusion object, self-place and rest self-liberated. This is the great Dharmakaya. From Self-Arisen: Dharmakaya great primordial wisdom scripture. Characteristics: three forms. Essence, nature, compassion three. These are Dharmakaya characteristics.

[17554-17565]
Hence. The structure...

[17559-17571]
This old hermit laughed when he finally understood. Primordial wisdom meaning—realize without traversing path-ground. Expression-limit-free great Dharmakaya—abiding in all, realized by none. Mind nonexistent, consciousness nonexistent, ignorance nonexistent. Sometimes labeled as basis-abide primordial wisdom, sometimes Dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis. Nature one, reverse aspects spoken. Body and primordial wisdom without gathering or separation—this is the intention to know.

[17572-17583]
Second: definitive meaning. Profound and vast dharmas' essence gathered, called Dharmakaya. Third: divisions. Looking at original purity great meaning, nature completely pure, existing in body, adventitious stain-free supreme Dharmakaya—three aspects. Three bodies become nine when divided. From Self-Arisen: though body is inconceivable, gathered into three.

[17583-17593]
What? Dharmakaya—transcended from sign object. Sambhogakaya—transcended from grasped object. Nirmanakaya—transcended from attachment object. These are Dharmakaya's three. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya is awareness.

[17590-17605]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Dharma appears as object. Body is unceasing awareness nature. Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is five lights. Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is eye sense-power seeing unceasingly. Dharmakaya object is completely pure sky. Dharmakaya abode is citta. Dharmakaya path is jewel crystal duct. Sambhogakaya also has three. CUT THROUGH NOW! Stop dividing what has never been separate!

[17606-17617]
Consequently...

[17615-17629]
Nirmanakaya also three: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Thus: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya is two lamps. Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is seeing five lights. Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is individual self-awareness where five afflictions arise. Nirmanakaya abode is brain. Nirmanakaya path is eye. Nirmanakaya object is delusion-appearance.

[17630-17643]
This wanderer...

[17636-17643]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The three kayas are not three separate places—they are one wisdom showing three faces. Like the same sun reflected in three different bowls of water. The reflections are different; the sun is one.

[17640-17650]
Voice 20 proclaims: The divisions of Dharmakaya into three, then nine, then countless—are pedagogical devices, not ultimate truths. Like a teacher using many examples to explain one point. Don't confuse the examples with the point.

[17645-17655]
Thus established...
