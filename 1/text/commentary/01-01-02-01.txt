The yak hair tent lets in drafts from every direction. Samantabhadra showing the path to himself—like a thief searching an empty hut for something to steal, finding nothing, realizing there was never anything to take. Some scholars get tangled in their own boots here, arguing which tantra came from where, when. Frozen butter lamp at dawn—they squint and fuss over shadows. Vajradhara is not some first Buddha who sat down one Tuesday and invented enlightenment. He is the nature that was never born, the point before points. The snow lion doesn't consult a calendar before it leaps.

A hermit once told me he understood emptiness completely. Then his tsampa ran out and he wept like a child. We talk about Buddhas manifesting countless times, oceans of beings, oceans of enlightenment—our words become smooth from overuse. The Flower Ornament Sutra describes what we cannot measure while sitting in our own cramped confusion. Meeting of Father and Son—they bow to each other in a mirror. Who is teaching whom? The ocean doesn't know it is wet.

Jewel-Garland, Lightning-Light—names like smoke from a distant fire. Samantabhadra offered a golden vajra and generated bodhicitta. What does this mean to someone whose knees ache in meditation and whose mind wanders to dinner? The offering was the recognition that there was nothing to offer, no one to offer it, no recipient. Thirty-six tantras arising from light-rays sounds impressive until you're fighting sleep at three in the morning, your back screaming, wondering if any of this is real. The doubt itself is the vajra.

Sixty perfections, countless Buddha-bodies, five-family radiance pouring from every pore—these are not rewards for good behavior. They are descriptions of what remains when you stop trying to achieve something. The thief returns to the empty hut night after night, still searching. Eventually he sits down and laughs. The OM MANI PADME HUM you recite while watching the butter lamp flicker—this is the same sound that emerged from the tongue-faculty of primordial awareness. You think you're practicing. Awareness is practicing you.
