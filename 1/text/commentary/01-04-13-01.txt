Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me to explain the difference between outer and inner tantra. I showed him my two hands. "This hand is outer," I said. "It washes, it purifies, it performs ritual. This hand is inner—it eats the five meats, drinks the five nectars, knows no pure or impure." He looked at his own hands for three days. Finally he understood: same hands, different view. The outer three vehicles rely on the three whites and so on, engage in bathing and purification, stay in retreat, and so forth—they become distressed. The inner ones consume the five meats and five nectars and so on, rely on consorts, and have no acceptance or rejection or pure/impure distinctions—superior to the lower.

But this old practitioner warns you: don't rush to the inner before understanding the outer. A foundationless house collapses. This yogi once tried to practice inner tantra while still judging his neighbor's impure conduct. His practice was like a lamp with no oil—bright for a moment, then darkness. The outer tantras—Kriya, Upa, Yoga—emphasize purity, cleanliness, ritual. You bathe, you purify, you maintain distance from the deity. This is necessary for some minds! The world is impure, practice is pure, you need to clean yourself to approach the sacred. This hermit respects this. He spent years in outer tantra. Learned discipline. Learned structure. But eventually, the structure became a cage. The purity became judgment. Time to go deeper.

The second has five divisions. Essence: the nature of spontaneously-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light's truth, directly realized without complication, achieving liberation in one lifetime. This is not a promise! This is a description of what's already true. Etymology: since great meaning is accomplished through effortless methods, the inner method vehicle. Purpose: accomplishing both attainments in one lifetime. Result: reaching Vajradhara's ground in this life. Divisions: Mahayoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, and Atiyoga pith instruction. From Self-Arisen Rigpa: "The inner is divided into three: Maha, Anu, and Ati." This old practitioner spent years trying to decide which one to practice. Should I start with Maha? Jump to Ati? His teacher laughed. "You're already practicing all three," she said. "You just don't know it yet."

[3335-3340]
The Mahayoga vehicle, the causal tantra: primarily through the generation stage method, meditation on the three samadhis realizing the great inseparability of truth, clear-empty wisdom of clear light. Divisions: ground, path, and result-focused; sadhana-focused; various-path-transformation positions—and so on. This yogi once collected one hundred Mahayoga sadhanas, thinking more practices meant more progress. He could barely complete one in a day. His teacher took ninety-nine away. "Now," she said, "you might actually finish something." The generation stage is powerful. You visualize the deity, you become the deity. But don't get stuck in the visualization. It's a tool, not the goal.

[3313-3321]
The superiority of inner tantra: it's direct. No complications. No gradual buildup. Just—recognize your nature. But this is also the danger! Without foundation, direct recognition becomes conceptual understanding. "I am already enlightened!" No, you're not. You're conceptually understanding enlightenment. Different. Build the foundation. Then jump. The outer tantras build the foundation. They teach discipline, structure, ritual. They purify the mind. They prepare the ground. Then the inner tantras plant the seed. The seed of recognition. The seed of wisdom. Don't skip the preparation.

[3322-3334]
Liberation in one lifetime. This is possible! But don't count on it. Practice as if you have countless lifetimes. Practice as if this is your last moment. Both attitudes together. This hermit doesn't know if he'll be liberated in this life. Doesn't worry about it. Just practices. The practice is the liberation. The path is the goal. The seeking is the finding. The three inner tantras—Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga—are progressive. Or simultaneous. Depends on how you look at them. Mahayoga emphasizes generation stage. Anuyoga emphasizes completion stage. Atiyoga emphasizes direct recognition. But all three are present in each.

[3335-3340]
Mahayoga: generation stage emphasis. Creating the mandala through visualization. Building the deity from the ground up. This is powerful! You become what you visualize. The mind is that flexible. But don't get stuck in the visualization. It's a tool, not the goal. This old practitioner knew someone who visualized for twenty years but never recognized the visualizer. Sad. The visualization is meant to show you the nature of mind. The deity is your own nature in symbolic form. Recognize this. Then let go of the symbol. Rest in the nature.

[3313-3321]
The outer tantras are like learning to walk. The inner tantras are like learning to run. You can't run before you walk. Well, you can try. But you'll fall. This hermit fell many times. Tried to practice inner tantra while his mind was still coarse. While he still judged, still grasped, still hoped and feared. It didn't work. He had to go back to the outer tantras. Back to purification, to ritual, to discipline. Build the foundation. Then the house will stand. Skip the foundation, and the house collapses. This is not a judgment. This is practical advice.

[3322-3334]
Essence, etymology, purpose, result, divisions—the five aspects of inner tantra. Longchenpa is systematic. But don't get lost in the system! The essence is spontaneously-arisen wisdom. Everything else is commentary. The purpose is liberation in one lifetime. Not because you're special, but because time is short and death is certain. This hermit feels the urgency. Winter is coming. The fire is burning low. Practice while you can. The result is Vajradhara's ground. The state of complete awakening. Not somewhere else. Right here. Recognized. The divisions are three: Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga.

[3335-3340]
Anuyoga: completion stage emphasis. Working with channels, winds, drops. The subtle body practices. This is physiological as well as psychological. You actually change the body through these practices. But the changes aren't the point. The recognition is the point. This yogi practiced Anuyoga for years. Felt the energies move. Interesting! But not liberation. Only when he stopped looking for experiences did the real teaching come. The completion stage completes what the generation stage began. Not by adding something new. By recognizing what was always there.

[3313-3321]
This hermit returns to the two hands. Outer and inner. Same hands, different view. The practices are different. The attitude is different. But the goal is the same. Recognition of your true nature. Liberation for the benefit of all beings. Don't think outer tantra is inferior. It's appropriate for some. It's necessary for most. Don't think inner tantra is superior. It's dangerous for the unprepared. It's confusing for the unready. Practice what you can practice. Practice what you've been taught. Practice with sincerity. That's the path.

[3322-3334]
This practitioner returns to the essence: spontaneously-arisen wisdom. Not created. Not constructed. Not achieved. Already present. Already perfect. The tantric path is not about becoming something. It's about recognizing what you already are. The generation stage, the completion stage, the direct recognition—all point to this. The deity is not someone else. The mandala is not somewhere else. They're your own nature, displayed for you to recognize. This is the tantric view. This is the Vajrayana path. Direct, profound, swift. But only if you're ready. Only if you practice.

Emaho! Outer, inner, secret—three doors to the same room. Don't get stuck in the doorway admiring the woodwork. Enter. The room is spacious. The room is your own mind. The room has always been your home. You never left. You just forgot. Remember now. Enter. Be at home. Be free. This is the tantric path. This is the Vajrayana. This is the swift path to awakening. But swift doesn't mean easy. Swift means direct. Face the truth directly. Recognize your nature directly. Liberate yourself and others. Emaho!
