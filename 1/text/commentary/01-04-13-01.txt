Ground in Mahayoga: three aspects. Ground for clarifying (the base), designated ground (names), ground as object of cultivation (practice). All are the same ground viewed differently. Like a mountain seen from valley, ridge, and peak. Same mountain. Different views. Don't confuse the views with the mountain. This hermit spent years studying the views. Forgot to climb. The ground is your own mind. The nature of mind. Clear light. Emptiness. Call it what you will. It's not somewhere else. It's not something you achieve. It's what you are, what you've always been, what you'll always be. Recognize this. That's the ground.

Path in Mahayoga: two aspects. Path for clarifying (ritual engagement), order-of-entry path (stages). The generation stage is the path—creating the mandala, visualizing the deity, accumulating merit. This works! But don't think the creation is the reality. The deity appears through your visualization. But the appearing is empty. Both true. Both necessary. This old practitioner created many deities. Forgot to ask: who creates? The creator is also empty. The visualization is also empty. The deity is also empty. But don't stop visualizing because of emptiness. Visualize with the understanding of emptiness. That's the path.

Result in Mahayoga: ripening (appearing variously), ripening of dharmata (not accomplished through effort). Two results, one result. Appearances continue, but recognized as self-liberated. That's ripening. Dharmata is always pure, always accomplished. That's the other ripening. Not two separate things. Two aspects of the same. This yogi wanted to "achieve" result. Ran toward it for years. Was already standing on it. The result is not somewhere else. It's not in the future. It's the nature of the path itself. The path walked to completion reveals itself as result. The seeking fulfilled reveals itself as finding.

Their essence: even merely conventionally, in the occasion of pure convention, viewing external vessel-world as celestial palace, supported sentient beings as deity mandala, seeing all beings as deity forms—purpose of not killing life for yidam, not lying, etc. No deliberate dharma in mind. Ultimately not established as any nature. Not falling into truth-transcendence. Realizing union inseparability—superior to outer. This old practitioner walks through the market and sees every face as a deity form. Some are wrathful, some peaceful, all are teaching. The thief is a deity teaching non-attachment. The saint is a deity teaching virtue. No difference in essence. Only in appearance.

Etymology of sadhana: accomplishing the single hero's mandala wheel. Purpose: accomplishing result through cultivating path. Result: becoming respective family's Buddha. Various-path-transformation: many traditions. This hermit collected sadhanas like some collect stamps. One hundred practices! Could barely finish one. His teacher took ninety-nine. "Now," she said, "you might actually accomplish something." One sadhana done completely is better than a hundred done partially. Choose one. Stick with it. Complete it. Then move on. Or don't move on. One is enough.

[3421-3430]
This practitioner returns to the tent analogy. Ground, path, result. The tent is always there (ground). You enter it (path). You realize you never left (result). This is Mahayoga in a nutshell. Not a journey to somewhere else. A recognition of what's always been true. The path creates the conditions for recognition. The recognition reveals the path was unnecessary. But you couldn't recognize without the path. This is the paradox. This is the mystery. This is the tantric path. Walk it completely. Then see: there was nowhere to walk.

Emaho! Mahayoga—great yoga of great illusion. Don't make it small by grasping. Don't make it great by rejecting. Just practice. Visualize the deity. Become the deity. Recognize the deity is your own mind. Recognize your own mind is empty. Rest in that emptiness. Act from that emptiness. Benefit beings from that emptiness. This is the path. This is the fruition. This is the great liberation. Emaho!
