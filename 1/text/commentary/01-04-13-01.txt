[3313-3321] The outer three vehicles rely on the three whites and so on, engage in bathing and purification, stay in retreat, and so forth—they become distressed. The inner ones consume the five meats and five nectars and so on, rely on consorts, and have no acceptance or rejection or pure/impure distinctions—superior to the lower. The lower ones cannot meditate on deity union, but the inner ones can—also superior. The outer ones don't realize the inseparability of truth in their view, but the inner ones do—superior.

[3322-3334] The second has five divisions. Essence: the nature of spontaneously-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light's truth, directly realized without complication, achieving liberation in one lifetime. Etymology: since great meaning is accomplished through effortless methods, the inner method vehicle. Purpose: accomplishing both attainments in one lifetime. Result: reaching Vajradhara's ground in this life. Divisions: Mahāyoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, and Atiyoga pith instruction. From Self-Arisen Rigpa: "The inner is divided into three: Mahā, Anu, and Ati."

[3335-3340] The Mahāyoga vehicle, the causal tantra: primarily through the generation stage method, meditation on the three samādhis realizing the great inseparability of truth, clear-empty wisdom of clear light. Divisions: ground, path, and result-focused; sādhana-focused; various-path-transformation positions—and so on.
