[6424-6455]
Seventh: samsara-destroyer king. In intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for beings' benefit—until great strife aeon, Vajradhara's great Brahma arrangement. Sequence from Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: each aeon, each Buddha enumeration, each retinue liberation manner. First: primordial first Buddha to strife aeon—sixty-six actually taught within inexpressible, teaching all sixty-four hundred-thousand number.

[6456-6485]
Primordial first Buddha: First, superior Smṛti-protector. Mudrā of self-remembering wheel. Word distinguishing superior from base. Śikhin, previous beginning arisen. Seventy myriads: this mudrā supreme. To: wisdom-protector of exhausted mindfulness. Essence, self-word, secret understood. Strife aeon: nineteen lineage-holders. Definitive mudrā supreme held. Inexpressible: from Buddhas' blessings, in self-arisen great letter, great primordially pure abiding. From descent, all self-arisen. Blessing sequence self-shown from first descent.

[6486-6511]
Inexpressible: other aeons, interval aeons' Buddhas condensed. From Great Arrangement: primordial first Buddha, supreme thousand mandala gathered. Second teaching: Śikhin, world protector. Supreme thousand: this mudrā. Third: thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. Thousand Buddhas' heart essence rolled. Fourth: thousand suns' king. Thousand Buddhas' dominion conquered. Fifth: Jvalamukha, world protector. Supreme thousand's heart concealed. Sixth: thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Thousand families: this concealed. Seventh: all-pervading samsara-destroyer, Brahma-protector. Thousand great bliss: crown held. Thus teaching: sixty-four hundred-thousand, that many Buddhas, great secret fully held.

[6512-6546]
Definitive teaching Buddhas: nineteen hundred-thousand, this mudrā essence rolled. Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons: great Brahma aeon. First protector's sixty-four hundred-thousand emanations arrangement, emanating as nineteen hundred-thousand Buddhas to disciples' perception, acting for benefit. King supreme Samantabhadra's abode: great Brahma arrangement. Teaching showing deed in Kaustubha jewel's sky, thirteenth within Vairocana's palm lotus petals center. All that kaya's abodes, five families' other abodes: teaching showing deed transcends thought. Buddha's deed, qualities, activities: three kayas equal to sky. Tenth-ground bodhisattvas cannot measure; worldly mind how can measure?

[6547-6573]
From Uttaratantra: Buddha-element, Buddha-awakening, Buddha qualities, activities—even for pure beings, inconceivable. From Ratnaketu: sky pervaded, kaya pervades that much. Kaya pervaded, light pervades. Light pervaded, speech pervades. Second: obtained liberation enumeration. Jambudvipa: great secret definitive teaching liberates hundred-thousand non-human dakinis beyond number. This occasion: liberation in this life and bardo—men, women, fully ordained, boys, girls enumeration. From Great Arrangement: Listen, fortunate monk Pal. Not abiding here, until sixty years life: one thousand liberation results arising self-release. Monk form, half; remainder bodhisattvas. Until fifty: two hundred-thousand obtain birthless. Mostly females' form; males two thousand. Then thirty years: six hundred-thousand, mostly males, by one hundred-thousand females. Arising self-release. Former retinue, degenerate time, obtained Buddhahood.

[6574-6600]
An old practitioner once tried to calculate these numbers. Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons. Nineteen hundred-thousand Buddhas. He spent years with his calculations. One day, watching prayer flags snap in the wind, he understood: the numbers were not for counting. They were for showing the vastness beyond counting.

[6601-6620]
Recognition is immediate.

This old yogi...

[6661-6680]
Sever immediately.

[6681-6700]
Between the elaborate enumeration of aeons and Buddhas and the direct recognition of Dzogchen, we find the treasury's heart. Not rejecting the numbers. Not grasping them. The architecture of time and space points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6701-6710]
The samsara-destroyer king is not a being who will come in some future aeon. The king is awareness itself, destroying samsara moment by moment. Each recognition is the destruction of cyclic existence. Each liberation is the crowning of the king.

[6711-6720]
What knows these words?

[6721-6725]
Thus. We proceed...
