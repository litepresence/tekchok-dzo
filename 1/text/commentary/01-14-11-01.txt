Thus. We proceed...

[20147-20160]
A humble practitioner...

[20159-20175]
Voice 20 proclaims: Path dimension five light circle, ripa na di inside body appear. From that: path appear dimension rigpa, dimension light rim, rigpa body five appear explained. Fruit dimension primordially pure self-appearance, sky cloudless like, rigpa that dimension inner dissolve arise-basis only abide.

[20166-20185]
Wake up. Now.

[20175-20200]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[20190-20215]
This old hermit practiced thogal for years. The measures seemed impossible—when to examine, when to rest, when to gather. Then he realized: the measures are not rules but descriptions. Like describing how water flows—don't try to follow the description; let the water flow naturally.

[20200-20225]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Attachment grasp not time, scholar grasp method know. Secret mantra familiarization characteristic. Then wisdom move time, element five dissolve, wisdom attachment-free, appearance object arrive time, appearance confusion-free see, familiarization truth see, light appearance joined like explained.

[20215-20240]
Between familiarization and realization, the vast middle way opens. The measures are not milestones to reach but signposts along a road with no destination. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace left behind, yet the flying is complete in itself.

[20230-20255]
In this manner...

[20250-20275]
This old man once...

[20270-20290]
Voice 20 proclaims: The four measures—exhaustion, familiarization, stability, increase—are not separate stages but four aspects of one process. Like the four seasons—not sequential in the sense of one ending before the next begins, but continuous transformation. Recognize this, and practice becomes effortless.

[20285-20310]
Hence. The structure...

[20300-20315]
This old hermit offers final teaching on dimension rigpa: Don't be rigid with measures. Don't be loose either. Like tuning a string—not too tight, not too slack. The measures guide, but recognition leads. When recognition is stable, measures become ornaments.

[20310-20325]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who boast of their measures! "I have reached stability," they say. "I have achieved exhaustion." Fools! The measures measure nothing. Recognition has no measure. Rest in what cannot be measured.
