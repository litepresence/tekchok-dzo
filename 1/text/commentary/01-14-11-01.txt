Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals dimension rigpa three. First basis: dimension rigpa heart center five light heap, chain rope resonance light root abide is rigpa. From Senge Tsal Dzog: basis abide dimension rigpa, path appear dimension rigpa, final deliver dimension rigpa. Basis dimension rigpa two: dimension dimension lamp, rigpa chain rope clear.

This old practitioner once confused basis, path, and fruit as sequential. Like steps on a ladder, he thought. But his teacher showed him: the basis is like the sun, the path like the rays, the fruit like the warmth—all simultaneous, all one sun. The distinction is pedagogical, not substantial.

Voice 20 proclaims: Path dimension five light circle, ripa na di inside body appear. From that: path appear dimension rigpa, dimension light rim, rigpa body five appear explained. Fruit dimension primordially pure self-appearance, sky cloudless like, rigpa that dimension inner dissolve arise-basis only abide.

[20166-20185]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Final deliver dimension rigpa: dimension nature appear, rigpa body essence show, therefore dimension rigpa explained. Dimension rigpa essential point this distinguish very precious. Second measure actual: from that, wisdom definite secret meaning, appearance piece piece time, scholar very examine.

[20175-20200]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Very subtle move time, familiarization very abide. Flicker subtle move time, see very grasp. Round subtle coiled time, scholar distraction-free samadhi stable. Stable fire body appear time, familiarization appearance not grasp. Correct all appear time, scholar appearance gather explained.

This old hermit practiced thogal for years. The measures seemed impossible—when to examine, when to rest, when to gather. Then he realized: the measures are not rules but descriptions. Like describing how water flows—don't try to follow the description; let the water flow naturally.

[20200-20225]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Attachment grasp not time, scholar grasp method know. Secret mantra familiarization characteristic. Then wisdom move time, element five dissolve, wisdom attachment-free, appearance object arrive time, appearance confusion-free see, familiarization truth see, light appearance joined like explained.

[20215-20240]
Between familiarization and realization, the vast middle way opens. The measures are not milestones to reach but signposts along a road with no destination. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace left behind, yet the flying is complete in itself.

[20230-20255]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Path appear appearance those inner dimension dissolve time, warm cold etc. ultimate element five also dimension coil, element mother dissolve, wisdom dimension dissolve, wisdom space coil, wisdom dimension move meaning time measure definite.

This old practitioner offers final teaching on measures: Don't be rigid with the four measures. They are guidelines, not prison bars. Like learning to ride a horse—at first you follow instructions rigidly, then you and the horse move as one. The measures dissolve into naturalness.

[20270-20290]
Voice 20 proclaims: The four measures—exhaustion, familiarization, stability, increase—are not separate stages but four aspects of one process. Like the four seasons—not sequential in the sense of one ending before the next begins, but continuous transformation. Recognize this, and practice becomes effortless.

[20285-20310]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The measures of thogal practice are refined instructions for those with capacity. For those without, they become obstacles. Like giving a razor to a child—dangerous. But in skilled hands, the razor cuts cleanly. The measures are the razor; recognition is the skill.

[20300-20315]
This old hermit offers final teaching on dimension rigpa: Don't be rigid with measures. Don't be loose either. Like tuning a string—not too tight, not too slack. The measures guide, but recognition leads. When recognition is stable, measures become ornaments.

[20310-20325]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who boast of their measures! "I have reached stability," they say. "I have achieved exhaustion." Fools! The measures measure nothing. Recognition has no measure. Rest in what cannot be measured.
