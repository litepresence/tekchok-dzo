[685-705]
Three aspects of expansion—first, completion. From Self-Arising: in the pure appearance of three kayas, one complete, two complete, all complete! Wisdom appearing unceasing and clear. Don't you see? It's not that you have to complete something—it's already complete! Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating. In awareness free from concept, five lights unceasing and clear. In great self-liberation without grasping, outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.

Listen to this carefully: "In awareness released from action, actor and acted complete in single moment." Not gradually, not step by step—in one moment! In awareness separated from mind, all variety complete. In great clear purity, deluded appearances complete. In great self-liberated self-appearance, other-arisen dharmas complete. Such is the manner of three kayas' completion. Not something you're working toward—what you already are!

[706-714]
Awakening—what does it mean? Being without dualistic grasping. From the same nature:
- Without action, delusion awakens
- Without concept, afflictions awaken
- Without grasping, self-arising awakens
- Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens
- Without attachment, ignorance awakens

See the pattern? Nothing to do, nowhere to go! Just stop grasping and what was confused awakens to what it always was. This is the manner of three kayas' awakening!

[715-727]
Expansion—qualities primordially accomplished, spontaneously expansive. From Self-Arising:
- In awareness free from concept, five lights clear, wisdom expansive
- In awareness free from actor/acted, three kayas expand without perceived object
- In awareness appearing without object, five lights expand without grasping mind
- In awareness great wisdom, self-appearance with meaning, fruit expands

Not acquiring qualities—recognizing what already is!

[728-750]
Now the expansive explanation of place—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya has ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent.

Essence: empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence. Unchanging, cessation without, pervading three—this is dharmakaya essence. Definition: expanse primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya. Essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion.

Emaho! Three kayas complete, awakened, and expansive right now!

[751-756]
Definition of dharmakaya—naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding. From Self-Arising: fearless, empty, and clear, all actions complete. This is dharmakaya's definition. Don't be afraid of emptiness, friend! It's not nothingness—it's clarity itself!

[757-762]
Self-body—freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere. No outer, no inner, no within expanse. This is dharmakaya's self-body. Stop looking for it as something to find or achieve!

[763-774]
Metaphors for dharmakaya—six beautiful images from Self-Arising:
- Like sun: through clear-light awareness, illuminating all
- Like ocean: through depth, vast and profound  
- Like lotus: unstained by defects, pure by nature
- Like mountain: unchanging, immovable
- Like space: vast without boundary or center
- Like lion: possessing primordial confidence that surpasses all

Sun, ocean, lotus, mountain, space, lion—these are dharmakaya's metaphors. Not mere poetry! Each points to a quality of your own mind right now!

[775-779]
Sign—transcending going and coming. Without going, without coming, without abiding. This is dharmakaya's self-sign. Not somewhere you travel to!

[780-784]
Appearance—like empty-clarity of sky's expanse. Unceasing clear tone, empty by essence. This is dharmakaya's appearance. Clear yet empty, appearing yet unreal—like the sky!

[785-789]
Place—great pure memory-thought. Without limit, without object, without grasping. This is dharmakaya's place. Not a location on a map!

[790-795]
Characteristic—essence, nature, compassion, three inseparable. This is dharmakaya's characteristic. Not one, not three—indivisible!

[796-802]
Object—self-clear awareness, empty without extremity, adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished. In great inseparability of expanse and awareness. Clear, luminous, unmixed—this is dharmakaya's object.

[803-806]
Intent—view unsevered by direction or side, meditation not established as entity or sign, conduct transcending apprehending and grasping.

Emaho! Dharmakaya complete in ten aspects!

[807-823]
Dharmakaya's conduct—free from cessation, fixation, attachment. Not something you do, friend—it's what remains when you stop doing! Meditation—crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering. Not a technique, just recognition! View—unseen, yet seeing-complete. Not something to look at, but the looking itself! Fruition—unmade, unarisen, free from arising. Already perfect, never needed making! Activity—nothing to accomplish, yet accomplished-complete. Enlightened activity happens without anyone doing it!

[824-839]
Now Sambhogakaya—five aspects. Essence from Self-Arising: birth exists yet death-free, possessing vajra. Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear. Five fathers, five fields, five clusters. Five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations. Five bases, five paths, five fruitions. Five abodes, five fields, five essences. This is sambhogakaya's essence—complete display of enlightenment!

[840-847]
Though expressed as birth from expanse, birth lacks self-characteristic—death-free! Death-lord demon conquered. From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges. Arisen wisdom transcends all arising. Realizing wisdom transforms meaning. In vast kayas, outer and inner clear.

[848-858]
Five lights: blue, white, yellow, red, green. Five kayas: essence-expanse, unchanging vajra, dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Five fathers: Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.

All this richness—not separate from you! Complete mandala of enlightenment right here!

Emaho!

[866-869]
Five mothers: Akashagarbha, Buddha-Lochana, Mamaki, Pandaravasini, Samayatara. Five clusters surrounded by five buddhas, periphery ornamented by five lights' enclosure.

[872-884]
Five primordials: paths primordially complete, kayas primordially established, rigpa primordially arisen, five lights primordially resonant, defilements primordially liberated. See? Not becoming pure—pure from the beginning!

Five knowledges from realization extent: know as five kayas, five wisdoms, five lights, self-appearance, great liberation free from duality.

[885-896]
Five realizations: realize field as expanse, beings as kayas, appearance as light, arise-liberation free from category, wisdom as rigpa.

Five bases: light-clear basis is rigpa, phenomena basis is kunzhi, delusion basis is sems, path basis is lamp, thought basis is wisdom.

[897-902]
Five common paths: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning.

[903-908]
Five uncommon paths: dharmata path of expanse, rigpa path of knowledge, light-clear path of two lamps, trekcho path of arise-liberation, thogal path of expanse-rigpa.

[909-920]
Five fruitions: wisdom fruition liberated in rig, light fruition delusion-appearance ceases, realization fruition delusion-thought clears, self-appearance fruition brought to exhaustion, final fruition dissolves into expanse.

Five abodes: thigle abode in heart, wisdom abode in crown, lamp abode in eyes, expanse-appearance abode in sky, liberation-place abode in primordial purity.

[921-933]
Five fields: rigpa's field is expanse, lamp's field is sky, wisdom's field is bardo, light's field is self-appearance, sambhogakaya's field is cluster.

Five essences: rigpa's essence primordial purity, wisdom's essence spontaneous accomplishment, light's essence five aspects, discriminating awareness essence realization, lamp's essence empty-clarity.

All these fives—just one display! Don't get lost counting, friend!

Emaho!

[934-937]
In these five aspects appearing, some are sambhogakaya's essence, some field, some method, some appearance, some wisdom itself. Thus Longchenpa explains sambhogakaya as one unified essence appearing fivefold. Not five separate things—one display with five faces!

[938-943]
Etymology of sambhogakaya—"longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku" means complete with qualities, engaging pure light-clarity, both benefits spontaneously complete, wisdom arrived at full measure, with marks, signs, body of radiating light rays.

[944-977]
From Self-Arising, the complete explanation:
- Abiding in empty dharmata—complete
- Clear, unmixed, pervading all—complete  
- In five wisdoms, gathering and separating not—complete
- Unequal to all, individual marks—complete
- Method and wisdom inseparable—complete
- Five appearances without marks—engage
- Without grasping, self-clear, playing in all—engage
- Crystal-clear, lucid, equally abiding—engage
- Vivid, soft, abiding in field, distributing emanations—engage
- Intent on two kayas, play to the extent—engage

All actions transcended—complete! Arisen from state, not made—complete! Emptiness-wisdom endowed. Clear without thought, grasping nonexistent. This is sambhogakaya's richness—not separate from your own clear awareness right now!

[978] Third, the characteristics...

Emaho! The complete enjoyment body!

[979-984]
Characteristics of sambhogakaya: mandalas of five families, unmixed, clear in tone. From Self-Arising: individual colors unmixed, marks held. Marks and exemplary features excellent, light rays blazing. Father, mother, and kaya form held. Rich display of enlightenment—not abstract, vividly present!

[986-993]
Manner of appearance: from single nature of rigpa, from expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates performing benefit. Kaya of rigpa unmoving from expanse, without change—two completions in field of self-appearance light-clarity. Inner and outer appearance. From same nature: in one nature, two essences—this is sambhogakaya's appearance.

[994-1014]
Manner of abiding: expanse without acceptance or rejection, space without duality, vast expanse of five complete lights, abiding in great continuity of radiating emanations. From Self-Arising: correctly produced without reference, without mind of entering or liberation. How could grasping exist? Beyond words of attachment. Beyond abandoning object and abandoner. Beyond field, mind, intellect. In reference-free field, self-appearance cuts through words. Grasping-free, liberated in own place, emanations enacted in ten directions. In reference-pure field appearance, wisdom arises in one cut. From that, emanations widely arise. Sambhogakaya's abiding—not stuck anywhere, radiating everywhere!

[1015-1020]
Third: Nirmanakaya's ground—five aspects: essence, etymology, characteristic, division, method of examination.

Emaho! Three kayas complete!
