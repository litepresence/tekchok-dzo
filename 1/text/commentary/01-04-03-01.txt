The Vehicle of Characteristics. Not for dull minds. Sharp faculties only. Powerful intellect required. Two truths as basis. This is precise architecture.

[2833]
This old practitioner once tried to master the Vehicle of Characteristics. He memorized the two truths. Conventional and ultimate. False and true conventional. Nominal and non-nominal ultimate. He became very precise. Very exact. And very confused. The truths were not the truth.

[2833-2834]
Two truths. Basis and method. Not separate realities. One reality viewed two ways. Like a mountain seen from valley and peak. Same mountain. Different view. The valley view is conventional. The peak view is ultimate. But the mountain never changed.

[2834-2835]
Knowing the two truths—how to practice? This is the crucial turn. Knowledge without practice is a map unread. Practice without knowledge is walking blind. The Vehicle of Characteristics demands both. Sharp analysis. Precise application. Like a jeweler cutting diamond.

[2835]
The fruit of complete path. Three bodies obtained. Dharmakaya for self. Rupakaya for others. Wisdom knowing all and extent of all. This is not mythology. This is the natural result of recognition applied systematically.

[2833-2835]
Between the systematic precision of the Vehicle of Characteristics and the direct recognition of Dzogchen, we find the graduated path. Not rejecting analysis. Going beyond it. The Treasury synthesizes: the two truths serve as foundation for the vast view that transcends all truths.

[2833-2835]
The wanderer in the wilderness laughs. Two truths? He knows only one: the sky above, the earth below, the breath between. No conventional. No ultimate. Just—this. But he recognizes: for those who need stairs, the Vehicle of Characteristics builds them well.

[2833-2835]
Therefore. Thus. The path arises for sharp faculties. Two truths as basis. Practice as method. Three bodies as result. This is the Vehicle of Characteristics. Architecture complete. Now recognize the architect.

[2835]
Three words. Two truths. One recognition. Enough.
