[2833-2835] Two truths? My grandfather said there are not two, not one, not any number. But he also said the teaching of two truths was like training wheels on a bicycle—useful until you don't need them. I never learned to ride a bicycle. Yaks don't have wheels.

[2836-2843] The conventional truth is like the reflection of the moon in water. You can see it, you can point to it, but don't try to pull it out and put it in your pocket. The ultimate truth? That's the moon itself, which also cannot be put in your pocket. Maybe pockets are the problem.

[2844-2861] False conventional—they call it "false" but it's not false like a lie. It's false like a dream is false: vivid, real-feeling, but gone when you wake. The problem isn't the dream. The problem is thinking it's the only reality. Or thinking you need to destroy the dream to find reality. The dream is reality's dream.

[2862-2869] True conventional is the virtuous actions, the ten good deeds, the path. These aren't lies—they function, they produce results. But they're like the steps of a staircase. You use them to climb, but you don't carry them with you once you've ascended. Or maybe you do, and that's fine too. The stairs don't mind.

[2870-2872] Ultimate truth is what remains when you stop looking for it. Or rather, it's what's already the case while you're looking. The looking itself is it. The seeker and sought never separate. Like trying to find your own head—you won't find it as an object, yet it's never absent.
