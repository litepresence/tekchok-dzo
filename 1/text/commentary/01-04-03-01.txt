The two truths—conventional and ultimate—this is the foundation of Mahayana practice. Like two wings of a bird, both needed for flight. This hermit spent years trying to fly with one wing, clinging to ultimate truth while neglecting conventional. He fell repeatedly, wondering why.

[2837-2848]
All phenomena of samsara and nirvana are included in the two truths. Conventional truth: what appears to mind, what can be thought and spoken. Like the face in a mirror—visible, recognizable, but not what it seems. Ultimate truth: the nature of that appearance, empty of inherent existence.

[2849-2861]
Wrong conventional is deluded appearance—things appearing to exist when they do not. Like a man who sees a rope as a snake and runs in terror. The snake is not there, but the fear is real. This is the world of ordinary beings, trapped in their own projections, mistaking illusions for reality.

[2862-2872]
Correct conventional appears deluded but functions as cause for happiness and liberation. Like the deities in a mandala—ultimately empty, conventionally powerful. The ten virtuous actions, generosity and so forth, accumulation of merit, the paths of accumulation and preparation. This is the skillful means, the path that leads while being itself empty.
