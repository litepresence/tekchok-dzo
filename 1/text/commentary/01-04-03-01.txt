[2833-2835]
The Vehicle of Characteristics. Not for dull minds. Sharp faculties only. Powerful intellect required. Two truths as basis. This is precise architecture.

[2833]
This old practitioner once tried to master the Vehicle of Characteristics. He memorized the two truths. Conventional and ultimate. False and true conventional. Nominal and non-nominal ultimate. He became very precise. Very exact. And very confused. The truths were not the truth.

[2833-2834]
Two truths. Basis and method. Not separate realities. One reality viewed two ways. Like a mountain seen from valley and peak. Same mountain. Different view. The valley view is conventional. The peak view is ultimate. But the mountain never changed.

[2834-2835]
Knowing the two truths—how to practice? This is the crucial turn. Knowledge without practice is a map unread. Practice without knowledge is walking blind. The Vehicle of Characteristics demands both. Sharp analysis. Precise application. Like a jeweler cutting diamond.

[2835]
The fruit of complete path. Three bodies obtained. Dharmakaya for self. Rupakaya for others. Wisdom knowing all and extent of all. This is not mythology. This is the natural result of recognition applied systematically.

[2833-2835]
Between the systematic precision of the Vehicle of Characteristics and the direct recognition of Dzogchen, we find the graduated path. Not rejecting analysis. Going beyond it. The Treasury synthesizes: the two truths serve as foundation for the vast view that transcends all truths.

[2833-2835]
The wanderer in the wilderness laughs. Two truths? He knows only one: the sky above, the earth below, the breath between. No conventional. No ultimate. Just—this. But he recognizes: for those who need stairs, the Vehicle of Characteristics builds them well.

[2833-2835]
Therefore. Thus. The path arises for sharp faculties. Two truths as basis. Practice as method. Three bodies as result. This is the Vehicle of Characteristics. Architecture complete. Now recognize the architect.

[2835]
Three words. Two truths. One recognition. Enough.

[2833]
A scholar once climbed a high pass in Kham, carrying texts on the two truths. At the summit, wind scattered his pages across the valley. He chased them for hours, then sat exhausted on a cairn. Watching prayer flags snap in the same wind, he understood: the truths he sought were not in the pages but in the space between them.

[2834]
The Vehicle of Characteristics is like a bridge across a gorge—necessary for those who cannot fly, but those who recognize their own wings no longer need the planks beneath their feet. This practitioner spent years building bridges. Then one day he jumped.

[2833-2835]
Between the false conventional of the deluded and the true conventional of the practitioner, there is only recognition. The same world appears to both. The same suffering. The same freedom. The difference is not in the world but in the seeing. This is the profound instruction of the Vehicle of Characteristics.

[2835]
CUT THROUGH NOW. Do not wait for complete analysis. Do not wait for perfect understanding. The two truths are not two. The vehicle is not a destination. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now.

[2833-2835]
This old fool has walked the path of characteristics. He has analyzed. He has practiced. He has recognized. Now he says: the path was never separate from the destination. The analysis was never separate from the recognition. The two truths point to one truth. Go. Recognize. Rest.
