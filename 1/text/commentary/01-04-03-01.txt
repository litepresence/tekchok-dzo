Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me: "Two truths? My grandfather said there are not two, not one, not any number." This old practitioner sat with that through three winters until his butter lamp ran dry. What did he find? The teaching of two truths was like training wheels on a bicycle—useful until you don't need them. I never learned to ride a bicycle. Yaks don't have wheels. But I understood what he meant. The two truths are a skillful means, a way of talking about what cannot be talked about. They point to the difference between how things appear and how they actually are. But don't get stuck on the number two! The ultimate truth is that there are not two truths. Or one. Or any number. The truths themselves are conventional designations. Even the teaching about the nature of the teaching is a teaching. This is the labyrinth of language. Enter it willingly, but don't build your home there.

Look here! The conventional truth is like the reflection of the moon in water. You can see it, you can point to it, you can navigate by it if you're clever. But don't try to pull it out and put it in your pocket. It won't fit, and you'll just get wet. This yogi once watched the moon's reflection in his tea cup for seven nights, waiting for it to get closer, trying to understand if it was the same moon as the one in the sky. Foolish! The ultimate truth? That's the moon itself, which also cannot be put in your pocket. Maybe pockets are the problem. Maybe the whole idea of possessing truth is the obstacle. The conventional truth works—yak herders navigate by it, merchants trade by it, we live our lives by it. But it's not the final story. It's the finger pointing, not the moon. Remember this when you're arguing about doctrine.

False conventional—they call it "false" but it's not false like a lie. It's false like a dream is false: vivid, real-feeling, emotionally compelling, but gone when you wake. Some hermit in a frozen valley spent years trying to wake from the dream while still dreaming. He thought if he meditated hard enough, he could pop out of the dream into reality. The problem isn't the dream. The problem is thinking it's the only reality. Or thinking you need to destroy the dream to find reality. The dream is reality's dream. The appearance is the play of awareness. This old practitioner still dreams every night. The difference? He no longer believes the dream is trying to trick him. He doesn't struggle against it. He watches it arise and dissolve like clouds in the sky. The eight similes—dream, magical display, city of gandharvas, reflection, echo, mirage, water-moon, magical creation—all point to the same insight. They appear, they function, they have consequences. But they lack inherent existence. This is the nature of the false conventional. Don't dismiss it as worthless. Don't grasp it as real. Use it as it is.

[2862-2869]
True conventional is the virtuous actions, the ten good deeds, the path of accumulation and preparation. These aren't lies—they function, they produce results, they create the causes for liberation. But they're like the steps of a staircase in an abandoned monastery. You use them to climb, but you don't carry them with you once you've ascended. Or maybe you do, and that's fine too. The stairs don't mind. This yogi once carried a stone step with him for three months, thinking he needed it for the next staircase, that it was somehow special, that it contained the essence of ascent. When he finally set it down, he laughed until tears froze on his cheeks. The six perfections, the path of seeing and meditation—all of these are conventional, all necessary, all ultimately empty. They are the raft to cross the river. But this old practitioner sees people building houses on their rafts, decorating them, making them permanent. Then they wonder why they never reach the other shore.

[2870-2872]
Ultimate truth is what remains when you stop looking for it. Or rather, it's what's already the case while you're looking. The looking itself is it. The seeker and sought never separate. Like trying to find your own head—you won't find it as an object in front of you, yet it's never absent. You can't see it, but without it, there would be no seeing. This hermit once spent a year looking for his head with a mirror. He looked at the reflection, tried to find the head behind the reflection, searched everywhere. Finally his teacher took the mirror away. "Now look," she said. That was thirty years ago. He's still looking. But now the looking is different. It's not a search. It's a recognition. The ultimate truth is not found. It's recognized. It's what has always been the case, obscured by the search itself.

[2870-2872]
The nominal ultimate is what you can talk about, conceptualize, point toward—the emptiness you read about in books, the void you meditate on, the freedom from elaboration that scholars debate. It's still a finger pointing. The ultimate ultimate? That's beyond even the concept of "beyond." Not another thing. Not nothing. Not both. Not neither. Language breaks here like a rope bridge over a deep chasm. Don't try to cross on broken ropes. Don't try to speak the unspeakable. The nominal ultimate serves a purpose—it gives the mind something to work with, a direction, a hint. But the true ultimate is beyond all hints. It is not separate from the conventional, not different from appearances. It's their nature. Their emptiness. Their lack of inherent existence. This old practitioner has learned to rest in the nominal ultimate while yearning for the ultimate ultimate. Both are necessary. Neither is the final destination.

[2833-2835]
This practitioner asks: why two truths? Why not one, why not three, why not infinite? The number doesn't matter. The teaching matters. Some minds need to hear "two" first—conventional to navigate the world, ultimate to find freedom. Some minds can leap directly to the recognition that there are no truths, no teachings, no path. The Buddha taught according to capacity, not according to some fixed curriculum. Like a grandmother teaching her grandchildren—different words for different ages, different approaches for different temperaments, but the same love underlying all of it. Don't think the two truths are a philosophical position to defend. They're medicine for a specific disease—the disease of grasping at appearances as real. When the disease is cured, the medicine is no longer needed. But while you're sick, take the medicine!

[2836-2848]
The Buddha's teachings on the two truths from the Root of Wisdom and the Magical Display—scriptural authority matters to some minds. They need to know this isn't just someone's opinion, that the Buddha himself taught this, that there is a lineage of realization behind the words. This is valid! But this old practitioner warns: don't get stuck in scriptural authority either! The finger points at the moon. Worshipping the finger won't get you to the moon. Reading about water won't quench your thirst. Studying maps won't take you to the destination. At some point, you have to look up. At some point, you have to drink. At some point, you have to walk. The scriptures are invaluable. They saved this practitioner's life many times. But they are not a substitute for direct recognition. Use them to point beyond themselves.

[2844-2861]
Eight similes of illusion: dream, magical display, city of gandharvas, reflection, echo, mirage, water-moon, magical creation. This hermit has chased mirages across the desert, thinking they were oasis. Has heard echoes in the canyon and answered back, thinking they were the voices of teachers. Has seen moon in water and tried to fetch it with a bucket. Each time, the lesson was the same: appearances are not what they seem, yet they are not nothing. The middle way is not a compromise between existence and non-existence, not a blending of eternalism and nihilism. It is the recognition that both extremes miss the mark. Things neither exist inherently nor are they complete non-existence. They appear dependently, like reflections, like dreams, like echoes. Dependent arising is the middle way. Dependent arising is emptiness. Emptiness is dependent arising. This is the heart of the Buddha's teaching, expressed through the two truths.

[2862-2869]
Ten good deeds, six perfections, path of seeing and meditation—all conventional, all necessary, all empty of inherent existence. This yogi spent years accumulating merit like a merchant hoards gold, thinking more merit meant more progress, that he could weigh his advancement on scales. Then one day he saw: the accumulation was the obstacle. Not because merit is bad, but because grasping at merit as "mine," as something to possess, something to increase, something to protect—this was the subtle trap. Merit is not a possession. It's not a quantity. It's the natural expression of wisdom and compassion. Give without giver, receive without receiver, act without actor. Easy to say! Takes lifetimes to live. This old practitioner is still learning. Every day, he discovers new ways he is grasping. Every day, he lets go a little more. That's the path.

[2870-2872]
This practitioner leaves you with a question: if ultimate truth is beyond words, why speak at all? Why did the Buddha teach? Why do teachers teach? Why am I writing this? Because some beings need words to reach wordlessness. Because the path is walked step by step, even when each step is empty, even when the walker is unfindable. Because compassion speaks even when it knows silence is truer. Because the teachings are a thorn used to remove a thorn, a dream used to wake from dreaming. Don't leave both thorns in your foot. Don't mistake the raft for the shore. Remove the first thorn with the second, use the raft to cross, then discard both. Walk freely. Swim without the raft. This is the way. This is the ultimate truth of the two truths—that there are not two. That the conventional is the ultimate's expression. That the ultimate is the conventional's nature.

[2844-2861]
This hermit returns once more to the false conventional because it is where we all live. The world of tables and chairs, of pleasure and pain, of self and other—this is the world of dependent arising, the world of interdependence, the world that appears real but is empty of inherent existence. The Buddha didn't say this world doesn't exist. He said it doesn't exist the way it appears. It appears solid, permanent, independent. It is actually fluid, impermanent, dependent. This is not philosophy. This is the nature of your experience right now. Look at your hand. It seems solid. But it's changing every moment. Cells dying, cells being born. It seems separate from the air around it. But molecules exchange constantly. It seems permanent. But it will age, wither, return to dust. This is the false conventional. Vividly appearing, completely empty. Both true. Neither true alone. This is the mystery at the heart of the two truths. Emaho!
