[1744-1749]
—again, these are not physical organs you can dissect. They are functions of knowing, ways that awareness modulates itself. Your physical eyes may fail, but the knowing that sees has never been damaged. Deafness does not touch the knowing that hears.

When Longchenpa speaks of the aggregates with thought and without thought

[1775-1831]
. You read that aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleshas

[1802-1809]
, and you must take this personally! Every moment of your life, you are creating the world you inhabit through the three poisons.

When you feel desire, you are not merely having a feeling—you are casting a vote for the desire realm, reinforcing the structures of attachment that bind beings. When anger arises, you are building hell realms, not in some future life but immediately, in the texture of your present experience. The hells are not locations; they are states of mind so contracted, so burning, so without relief, that we call them hell.

Longchenpa lists the six afflictions: ignorance, delusion, hatred, pride, attachment, jealousy

[1824-1831]
. Look at yourself! Which one rules you today? Is it the confusion that doesn't know what is truly happening? The anger that burns everything it touches? The pride that makes you separate and superior? The attachment that grasps and never lets go? The jealousy that poisons every relationship?

You think these are just emotions, just natural responses? No! They are the architects of samsara. Through these, you have built the world you suffer in. And the kicker is—you are doing it right now, even as you read these words. Is your mind grasping at understanding? Is there pride in knowing? Is there aversion to what challenges you?

The eighty-four thousand conceptual masses [1837] are not abstract categories. They are the individual thoughts you have every day, multiplied across all beings, creating a storm of confusion so vast it seems like the world itself. But the world IS that confusion, solidified, repeated, believed.

Yet Longchenpa gives the antidote: "All of these, although non-existent, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water, like confusion, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope" [1842]. You who suffer so intensely from these afflictions—where are they now? In the past moment, they seemed so real, so solid. In this moment, can you find them? They are like dreams that terrify until you wake.

The rope has never been a snake. Your mind has never truly been afflicted. This is not optimism—it is the nature of things, waiting for you to recognize.

[1865-1901]
, and you must understand: these vehicles are not paths you travel from here to there. They are ways of seeing, levels of recognition, and you may shift between them many times in a single day!

The worldly vehicle—the vehicle of gods and humans—is where most of you dwell. You accumulate merit, maintain virtue, and hope for better circumstances

[1895-1896]
. Nothing wrong with this! But do not mistake it for liberation. It is like cleaning your prison cell until it becomes comfortable—you are still in prison.

Then comes the mistaken vehicle

[1900-1901]
, and Longchenpa is fierce here.
