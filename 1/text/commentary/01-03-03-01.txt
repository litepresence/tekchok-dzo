[1744-1749]
—again, these are not physical organs to dissect. They are functions of knowing, ways awareness modulates itself. This hermit's physical eyes have grown cloudy with age, but the knowing that sees—has that ever been damaged? His hearing fades, but the knowing that hears—where has it gone?

When Longchenpa speaks of the aggregates with thought and without thought

[1775-1831]
. This practitioner read that aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleshas

[1802-1809]
, and he took it personally. Every moment of this life—casting votes for realms through the three poisons.

When desire arises, it is not merely a feeling—it is a vote for the desire realm, reinforcing the structures of attachment that bind beings. When anger burns, it is building hell realms immediately, in the texture of present experience. This hermit once thought hells were somewhere else, far away. Then one day he felt rage so intense, so without relief, and knew: this is hell. Not a place—a state of mind so contracted it burns.

Longchenpa lists the six afflictions: ignorance, delusion, hatred, pride, attachment, jealousy

[1824-1831]
. This yogi watches his own mind: today confusion, tomorrow anger, the next day pride. Each one ruling in turn, like a mad king on a rotating throne. The confusion that does not know what is happening. The anger that burns everything. The pride that separates and makes superior. The attachment that grasps and never releases. The jealousy that poisons every relationship.

This old practitioner once thought these were just emotions, natural responses. Then he saw: they are the architects of samsara. Through these, beings build the world they suffer in. And the kicker—this is happening right now, even as these words are read. Is the mind grasping at understanding? Is there pride in knowing? Is there aversion to what challenges?

The eighty-four thousand conceptual masses [1837] are not abstract categories. They are the individual thoughts multiplying across all beings, creating a storm of confusion so vast it seems like the world itself. But the world IS that confusion, solidified, repeated, believed.

Yet Longchenpa gives the antidote: "All of these, although non-existent, are grasped as self—like a mirage, like water, like confusion, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope" [1842]. This hermit who suffered so intensely from these afflictions—where are they now? In the past moment they seemed so real, so solid. In this moment, can they be found? They are like dreams that terrify until waking.

The rope has never been a snake. The mind has never truly been afflicted. This is not optimism—it is the nature of things, waiting to be recognized.

[1865-1901]
, and this practitioner understands: these vehicles are not paths traveled from here to there. They are ways of seeing, levels of recognition, and one may shift between them many times in a single day.

The worldly vehicle—the vehicle of gods and humans—is where most dwell. Accumulating merit, maintaining virtue, hoping for better circumstances

[1895-1896]
. Nothing wrong with this! But this hermit learned: do not mistake it for liberation. It is like cleaning a prison cell until it becomes comfortable—still in prison.

Then comes the mistaken vehicle

[1900-1901]
, and Longchenpa is fierce here.
