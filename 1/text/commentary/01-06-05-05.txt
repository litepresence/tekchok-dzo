[8677-8686] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Fifth joy—emptiness. Mind and wisdom neither opening nor closing, not transcending extremes or distinctions.
This is the vast middle way, the place where all journeys end and begin.
The five stages complete themselves not in sequence but in simultaneity.
First joy from joy only, second feeling experience touch, third bliss itself called,
fourth experience co-emergent, fifth emptiness called. Each contains all. All contain each.

[8677-8686] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
Stop searching. Start seeing.
The fifth joy is not more joy. It is joy liberated into its own nature.
Mind and wisdom were never two, never one. The extremes you sought to transcend—you created them.
Now rest without creating. This is the thirteenth moment of change, the crucial point of viewing.

[8677-8686] Voice 13 (Patrul):
They want to know the five stages like steps on a ladder. Climb, climb, climb!
But this old man tells you—the ladder stands on ground you never left.
The fifth joy, emptiness, stong-pa nyid—they fear it like death. "Where is my bliss?" they cry.
Gone, like morning mist. Good riddance! Now you can see the mountain.

[8677-8686] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
The five joys are the five wisdom buddhas dancing.
First joy—Akshobhya, immovable. Second feeling—Ratnasambhava, jewel-born.
Third bliss—Amitabha, boundless light. Fourth experience—Amoghasiddhi, unfailing accomplishment.
Fifth emptiness—Vairochana, the illuminator.
They dance in your heart, practitioner. Do you not feel their footsteps?

[8677-8686] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
Five fingers on my hand. Each different, yet all connected to one palm.
The five joys are like that—distinct experiences flowing from one source.
I use my hand to eat, to work, to gesture. The fifth joy, emptiness, is the space between the fingers.
Without that space, no hand. Without emptiness, no joy.

[8677-8686] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
In this manner.
Stage one: entry. Stage two: feeling. Stage three: bliss activation.
Stage four: co-emergence. Stage five: emptiness as culmination.
Precise analysis: this is not a linear hierarchy but a mandala structure.
Twelfth: viewing that itself—the integration of all five with the view of atiyoga.

[8677-8686] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
The five joys dissolve into spaciousness. Not opening, not closing—like the sky that never says "I am open" or "I am closed."
The extremes have never existed. Distinctions are mind's entertainment.
Rest in the emptiness that is full, the fullness that is empty.

[8677-8686] Voice 22 (Drolo):
The five joys? SUDDEN WRATH! They think they can stage-manage enlightenment!
First this, then that, then emptiness! HA!
The heruka's wrathful laughter shatters their careful progression.
The five joys appear simultaneously in the moment of recognition.
NO SEQUENCE! NO STAGES! See the nature (rang bzhin) ALL FIVE AT ONCE!

[8677-8686] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Thus it is spoken from before. The five joys are not to be accumulated like merit badges.
They are signposts along a pathless path. When you reach the fifth, you see the first was already complete.
When you understand emptiness, you see joy was never absent from the beginning.
This is the vastness of Dzogchen, the all-pervading view.
