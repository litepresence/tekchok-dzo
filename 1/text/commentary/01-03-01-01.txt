They are your own body, your own experience, your own mind's display! You feel solid—this is earth element holding you together [1595]. You feel emotions flowing—this is water element moving through you [1596]. You burn with anger or desire—this is fire element blazing [1597]. Your thoughts move constantly—this is wind element never still [1598]. And the space that allows all these to function? That is the space element, vast and open, holding the whole show [1599]. But here is what you must see: these elements do not exist out there separate from you. When you touch earth, you touch your own solidity. When you drink water, you drink your own flow. The fire that cooks your food is the same fire that digests it in your belly. The wind that moves the trees moves your breath. The space that holds the stars holds your awareness. Longchenpa describes how outer elements produce the basis of body, how inner elements create the world you perceive

[1601-1606]
. This is not philosophy—this is direct pointing! When your mind is clear, the world is clear. When your mind is disturbed, the world appears disturbed. The elements are mind's own play, mind's own dance.

You think you live in a world made of matter? Look again! The form element arises from mindfulness

[1607-1620]
—these are not two. They are one display, like a dream where the mountain and the mind that dreams it cannot be separated. You are not in the world; the world is in you, as you, made of you.

So when you meditate on the elements, do not look outward. Feel the earth in your bones, the water in your blood, the fire in your warmth, the wind in your breath, the space in your awareness. Rest in that recognition, and the artificial boundary between self and world collapses like a frost-drawn circle in morning sun.

[1621-1622]
—from your own attention, your own holding of experience. Without the knowing, what form exists? Can you show me a form that is not known? Can you demonstrate an earth that is not perceived?

The elements gathered by outer objects and the elements gathered by inner mind

[1623-1670]
, and you must not let this become mere academic study!

[1623-1666]
—this is how you construct your prison moment by moment. You see a form, consciousness arises, contact happens, feeling follows, and immediately you are caught: "I like this, I don't like that." 

Look at how it happens: The eye element arises from clear knowing [1646], the ear from single-pointed knowing [1647], and so forth. But what is this knowing? Is it inside you? Outside? Neither? When you truly look for where seeing happens, where hearing occurs, you cannot find a boundary. The sound and the hearing are one event, not two!

You think your senses connect you to the world? No! They create the illusion of separation. The sense sources expand as grasper and grasped

[1667-1670]
, he is showing you that even liberation has been conceptually divided!
