Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to pronounce that Sanskrit title and gave up halfway through—too many syllables for frozen lungs at high altitude. But the meaning? That is simpler. This old practitioner watched his own hands grow stiff with cold one winter, and understood: earth element holding form together. Watched his frozen butter lamp melt, and saw: water element flowing. Felt his belly warm the tea, and recognized: fire element burning. Watched his breath cloud the air, and knew: wind element never still. And the space inside that tent where all this happened? Space element—vast enough to hold the whole frozen world.

Longchenpa describes how outer elements produce the basis of body, how inner elements create the world you perceive

[1601-1606]
. This yogi once sat in meditation until his legs went numb, thinking he was "transcending the elements." Foolish! The numbness itself was earth becoming heavy, water pooling, fire fading, wind slowing. There is no escape from the elements because there is nothing to escape from.

The form element arises from mindfulness

[1607-1620]
—like a dream where the mountain and the mind that dreams it cannot be separated. Some hermit once spent years looking for the "real" world outside his mind. He searched the mountains, the valleys, the markets. Finally he returned to his hut, exhausted, and saw: the searching itself was mind's display. The exhaustion was mind. The return was mind. What he sought was what sought.

So when this practitioner meditates on the elements, he does not look outward. He feels the earth in his bones, the water in his blood, the fire in his warmth, the wind in his breath, the space in his awareness. The boundary between self and world collapses like a frost-drawn circle in morning sun. Not because he makes it collapse—because it was never drawn.

[1621-1622]
—from attention itself, from holding experience. Some hermit once asked: "Without knowing, what form exists?" He sat with that question through three winters. Finally he laughed—form and knowing arise together, like a reflection and the mirror. Can you have one without the other?

The elements gathered by outer objects and the elements gathered by inner mind

[1623-1670]
, and this old practitioner warns: do not let this become mere words on a page!

[1623-1666]
—this is how confusion builds its prison moment by moment. A form appears, consciousness arises, contact happens, feeling follows, and suddenly: "I like this, I don't like that." This hermit spent decades caught in that net.

The eye element arises from clear knowing, the ear from single-pointed knowing, and so forth. But what is this knowing? Some yogi once searched for where seeing happens. Inside the eye? No. Outside? No. Between? Where is between? He looked and looked until the looking itself became the answer—sound and hearing are one event, like a reflection in still water.

The sense sources expand as grasper and grasped

[1667-1670]
, and this old practitioner sees: even the notion of liberation has been conceptually divided!
