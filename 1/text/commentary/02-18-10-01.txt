Look here, dear practitioner! The wisdom palace takes shape—like sun-moon pair connecting, like lotus stack form, like stupa stack form, like thousand-petaled lotus! These arise from transcending the binding of five elements. They arise and cease together—one-arising, one-ceasing experience! From previous difference becoming, called "above increase." Thus awareness cause arises previously, empowerment sequence relies on arising. Second vision manner particular explained: Wisdom five color vision and shape vision.
