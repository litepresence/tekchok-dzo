Fifth: web-protector Buddha. The web is not a trap. The web is the interconnected nature of all appearance. Each node a world, each strand a connection. The protector guards the web by knowing it is empty. Nothing can tear what was never woven. Nothing can escape what never held anything. The web-protector sits at the center that has no center.
