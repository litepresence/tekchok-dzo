Fifth: web-protector Buddha. The web is not a trap. The web is the interconnected nature of all appearance. Each node a world, each strand a connection. The protector guards the web by knowing it is empty. Nothing can tear what was never woven. Nothing can escape what never held anything. The web-protector sits at the center that has no center.

[6423-6430]
An old practitioner once studied this web for seven years. He traced each strand, mapped each node, documented each connection. On the seventh anniversary of his study, a spider dropped onto his page. It spun a web in moments, then sat at its center. The practitioner saw: the web was never separate from the spider. The spider was never separate from the web.

[6431-6440]
Three words that dissolve all webs: emptiness itself. The web is not a structure. It is a display. The nodes are not points. They are awareness. The strands are not connections. They are the play of awareness. The center is not a place. It is recognition.

[6441-6450]
Therefore. Thus. The web-protector teaches what the previous Buddhas taught: interconnectedness is not separate from emptiness. The web and the protector are not separate. The protection is the recognition of emptiness.

[6451-6460]
Between the web and the recognition that transcends all connection, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the interconnectedness. Not grasping it. The web points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This old practitioner has been caught in many webs—celestial and human. He has struggled against entanglement. Now he sees: the struggle was the web. The recognition of emptiness is the only freedom. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6471-6480]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The web was never woven. The nodes were never connected. The center was never anywhere. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. Do not struggle to escape the web. See through it NOW.

[6481-6490]
Therefore. Thus. The fifth Buddha completes his teaching. The web has been mapped. The emptiness has been pointed to. The path continues or nowhere at all. Both are the same. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the connections.

[6491-6500]
Three words that dissolve all entanglement: awareness itself. The web is awareness. The spider is awareness. The center is awareness. The entanglement is awareness. The freedom is awareness. The recognition is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who is the spider?" The answer came in a flash: no one. There was never any spider. The web was never woven. The center was never anywhere. All was awareness, playing at being caught and freed.

[6511-6520]
Therefore. Thus. The fifth Buddha is complete. The web has been examined. The emptiness has been seen. The recognition has dawned. All complete, yet nothing was ever incomplete. Rest in that completion.

[6521-6530]
CUT THROUGH. The web is not a trap. It is a display. The spider is not a weaver. It is awareness. The center is not a place. It is recognition. Cut through all of it NOW. Rest in awareness.

[6531-6540]
This old practitioner has nothing more to say about webs. He has been caught and freed countless times. Now he rests where there is no web, no spider—only awareness displaying as all of it. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[Final] Three words complete.
