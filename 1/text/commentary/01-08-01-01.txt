Seven bases. Seven views. Seven blind men touching different parts of the same elephant. This is not philosophy—this is what happens when the unlimited is forced into limited containers.

[10478-10486]
Therefore. Thus. The Great Perfection presents seven ways of describing the basis. Not because there are seven bases. Because minds need seven doors to enter what has no entrance.

[10478-10481]
First: primordially pure from the beginning. Like space unstained by the clouds that pass through it. The purity is not achieved. It is the nature of what is.

[10480-10491]
Second: spontaneously present. Like the sun that does not choose to shine, yet illuminates all. Qualities complete without cultivation. Radiance without effort.

[10482-10492]
Third: uncertain, indeterminate. Not fixed as this or that. Not captured by any concept. The awareness that refuses to be boxed. Seven blind men arguing about the elephant, each convinced they hold the truth.

[10483-10493]
Fourth: certain, established. Unchanging in its nature. While appearances transform, the basis remains. Like the ocean holding all waves without becoming the waves.

[10484-10494]
Fifth: transformable into anything. The mirror showing all reflections without becoming any. The basis as infinite potential, not fixed identity.

[10485-10495]
Sixth: accepting anything that arises. The ground that holds samsara and nirvana equally. Not choosing between confusion and liberation. Both are its play.

[10486-10496]
Seventh: various, manifold, multi-colored. The appearance without ceasing. The variegated display that is mistaken for multiplicity. Like one crystal showing many colors—seven men seeing seven different elephants.

[10487-10497]
This old practitioner has held each of these views in turn. He thought primordial purity was the final truth. Then spontaneous presence. Then uncertainty. Each view was a prison he mistook for liberation. Finally he laughed—all seven are fingers pointing at the same moon, and the moon is not participating.

[10498-10508]
From the Thalgyur: The manner of abiding spontaneously established from the beginning also manifests through the manner of the seven bases. Multiplicity appears as spontaneous presence. What changes is uncertain. What does not change is certain. The measure of appearance is transformable. Because all arise, assertions are made. Because confusion is purified as primordially pure, all manners of appearance are called variegated.

[10498-10508]
The tantra speaks in seven voices to reach seven minds. But the basis itself never speaks. It is spoken about. This is crucial: the seven bases are descriptions, not the described. The menu is not the meal.

[10509-10535]
From Klongdrukpa: The basis spontaneously established from the very beginning, although not existing as a singular entity that can be grasped. When abiding as spontaneous presence, the gathering of multiplicity appears as the essential nature. When abiding as uncertain, the aspect of mind that transforms appears. When abiding as certainty, remembrance without movement. When abiding as transformable, mind through effort. When abiding as essence of what-is, whatever appears appears as its own nature. When abiding as variegated, various individual manners. When abiding as primordially pure, stains appear as primordially non-existent. All these arise from stages of mind's own delusion, while one's own face is primordially pure.

[10509-10535]
Seven appearances from one nature. Like one face reflected in seven mirrors, each mirror claiming it sees the true face. The reflection is accurate. The claiming is confusion. The face was never in the mirror.

[10536-10547]
Second: demonstrating that the seven bases that fall into conceptual extremes are faulty. Like blind men describing an elephant before them, each grasping only a part. When proponents hold tenets by fixating on one limited aspect of awareness as the complete realization, each establishing their acceptance deeply as the whole truth, they become the blind men arguing in the marketplace. Each is partially correct. Each is completely wrong.

[10536-10547]
Three words. Seven views. One recognition. The seven bases are seven ways of missing the point while believing you've grasped it. Stop counting the bases. Start recognizing what the counting obscures.

[10546-10547]
The refutation is not destruction. It is widening the prison walls until they become space. Spontaneous presence does not need defense. Primordial purity does not need proof. Certainty and uncertainty are both thoughts. The basis is prior to thought. Rest there.

[10472-10547]
Between the seven positions and the recognition that transcends all positions, Longchenpa weaves the path. Not rejecting the seven. Not clinging to any. The seven are training wheels. Eventually you ride without them. The ground remains, whether described seven ways or not at all.

[10547]
This old practitioner has nothing more to say. The seven bases have been described. The elephant has been touched. Now ride.
