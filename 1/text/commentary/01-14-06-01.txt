[19303-19309]
In this manner...

[19303-19316]
An old traveler...

[19310-19325]
Voice 20 proclaims: This very light all arise-basis and cease-place both. That also: first dimension appearance, now path appearance, between self-appearance—all this life five lights outer arise, now or between or basis appearance dissolve time, these five dimension self-absorbed. Briefly: inner body wisdom abiding, outer appearance body wisdom appear arise-basis and cease-place both.

[19317-19332]
Stop searching. Start seeing.

[19326-19345]
Hence. The structure...

[19333-19352]
This old hermit found an old crystal in the mountains. In its clear depths, rainbows appeared—not created by the crystal, not separate from it. The five lights are like this: not created by awareness, not separate from it. The crystal doesn't try to show rainbows; they naturally appear. So too with the bindu.

[19339-19358]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: First, heart center five lights spontaneous bindu, light root clear inside dwell. Five lights' rim appear, therefore called nature light bindu. That primordially pure rigpa ornament, therefore called Samantabhadra bindu. From that: basis-grasp bindu two—nature light bindu and Samantabhadra bindu. This very Guhyasamaja indestructible bindu called.

[19345-19370]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The bindu is not a thing, not nothing. It is the potential for all appearance, like a seed containing the tree. Not the seed, not the tree, but the continuity between them. This is the secret of the bindu.

[19360-19380]
Consequently...

[19370-19395]
This cave dweller...

[19380-19400]
Voice 20 proclaims: The bindu is the bridge between basis and fruit. On the basis, it is the potential for all display. On the path, it is the support for practice. In the fruit, it is the complete realization. Three names for one reality—like water, ice, and steam, all H2O.

[19400-19425]
Thus established...

[19420-19450]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't chase the five lights like a child chases rainbows. The rainbow is not the goal; the clear sky is. The lights are signs on the path, not the destination. Rest in the nature of awareness, and lights appear naturally. Seek the lights, and you lose the nature.

[19445-19460]
Voice 20 proclaims: The bindu is wisdom's fingerprint pressed into space. Recognizable, yet not separate from the finger. Vivid, yet empty. Present, yet ungraspable. This is the nature of all appearance when seen directly.

[19450-19470]
The framework reveals...
