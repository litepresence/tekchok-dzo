[19303-19309]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the five lights. First: in primordially pure dimension, spontaneous self-resonance like crystal light inside, actually color not-clear five lights—basis self-arisen rigpa dimension depth dwell. From Sun-Moon Union: non-abiding wisdom place pure color transcended light is stainless white self-pure, appearance wherever not divide; non-sought placed yellow self-pure, object many not appear; attachment-free red self-pure, knowledge this knowledge-object not appear; action effort-free green self-pure, action deed all beyond; unchanging vast blue self-pure, knowledge what essence also not established abide.

[19303-19316]
This old practitioner spent years trying to see the five lights in meditation. He saw colors, flashes, visions—then realized the five lights are not visions. They are the nature of awareness itself. The white is clarity, the yellow is increase, the red is attachment-free nature, the green is action-accomplished, the blue is unchanging vastness. Always present, never separate.

[19310-19325]
Voice 20 proclaims: This very light all arise-basis and cease-place both. That also: first dimension appearance, now path appearance, between self-appearance—all this life five lights outer arise, now or between or basis appearance dissolve time, these five dimension self-absorbed. Briefly: inner body wisdom abiding, outer appearance body wisdom appear arise-basis and cease-place both.

[19317-19332]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Second, color-grasp five lights: from Self-Arisen—wisdom from light arise, wisdom unchanging therefore blue arise; wisdom pure therefore white arise; wisdom quality arise therefore yellow arise; wisdom power complete therefore red arise; wisdom activity complete therefore green arise. All sentient beings thus abide.

[19326-19345]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. From previous: self-appearance clear color-grasp light is five: white, yellow, red, green, blue. Fourth, bindu three: from Sun-Moon Union—bindu three: basis-grasp bindu, appearance path bindu, fruit self-ripen bindu.

[19333-19352]
This old hermit found an old crystal in the mountains. In its clear depths, rainbows appeared—not created by the crystal, not separate from it. The five lights are like this: not created by awareness, not separate from it. The crystal doesn't try to show rainbows; they naturally appear. So too with the bindu.

[19339-19358]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: First, heart center five lights spontaneous bindu, light root clear inside dwell. Five lights' rim appear, therefore called nature light bindu. That primordially pure rigpa ornament, therefore called Samantabhadra bindu. From that: basis-grasp bindu two—nature light bindu and Samantabhadra bindu. This very Guhyasamaja indestructible bindu called.

[19345-19370]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The bindu is not a thing, not nothing. It is the potential for all appearance, like a seed containing the tree. Not the seed, not the tree, but the continuity between them. This is the secret of the bindu.

[19360-19380]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Cakrasamvara unchanging bindu called. Always heart abide, bindu one unchanging, that meditate person, definitely wisdom arise. Second, path bindu two: in four channels, bindu from light five arise; in avadhuti, bindu wisdom essence clear dwell.

[19370-19395]
This old practitioner once received teachings on the bindu from a wandering yogi. "The bindu is like a lamp flame," the yogi said. "It appears to flicker, yet the oil and wick remain. So too with consciousness—the bindu appears to move through realms, yet its nature never changes."

[19380-19400]
Voice 20 proclaims: The bindu is the bridge between basis and fruit. On the basis, it is the potential for all display. On the path, it is the support for practice. In the fruit, it is the complete realization. Three names for one reality—like water, ice, and steam, all H2O.

[19400-19425]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The five lights and bindu are not external visions to seek. They are the nature of awareness itself, spontaneously present from the first. Recognize this, and every perception is wisdom's display. Miss this, and even visions become obstacles.

[19420-19450]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't chase the five lights like a child chases rainbows. The rainbow is not the goal; the clear sky is. The lights are signs on the path, not the destination. Rest in the nature of awareness, and lights appear naturally. Seek the lights, and you lose the nature.

[19445-19460]
Voice 20 proclaims: The bindu is wisdom's fingerprint pressed into space. Recognizable, yet not separate from the finger. Vivid, yet empty. Present, yet ungraspable. This is the nature of all appearance when seen directly.

[19450-19470]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The five lights and three bindus are complete instructions for thogal practice. Yet they point to what cannot be practiced—direct recognition. Use the instructions, but don't mistake them for the recognition. The map is not the territory.
