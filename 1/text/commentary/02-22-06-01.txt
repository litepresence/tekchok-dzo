[11825-11830]
If you fear the displays, this is the demon of fear. These must be recognized as obstacles.

[11825-11842]
Samsara's confused paths

[11831-11855]
When displays arise but you do not recognize them as your own face, you wander in delusion. Like a deer chasing a mirage, you pursue empty forms. This is the pitfall of thod rgal practice. You must have the lama's introduction and your own recognition.

[11843-11857]
: dream path, habitual path, karma's end path, uncertain illusion path, uncertain cause-result path. Know these well!

Hell-realm signs

[11856-11880]
Some practitioners see lights and think they have attained enlightenment. They stop practicing, filled with pride. This is a great error. The displays are merely the path, not the result. Do not be satisfied with mere experiences!

[11858-11881]
: at death, dark clouds gathering like smoke, rain, steam, great wind, hail, falling dust. These indicate the eight hot hells, eight cold hells, neighboring, sentient-being hell, vajra hell—seven destinations of intense suffering.

The Avatamsaka Sutra

[11881-11905]
Others become frightened when they see the empty forms or hear sounds. They run away from the practice, thinking they have gone mad. This too is delusion. These displays are your own mind—there is nothing to fear.

[11882-11900]
teaches: rejecting Dharma leads to Avici hell, lasting an entire kalpa, suffering immeasurable. Even when the great fire kalpa burns, you remain—such is the result of abandoning the holy Dharma!

For tantric practitioners

[11901-11913]
, violating vajra guru samaya leads to Vajra Hell—lasting until the ocean is emptied by hair-strands, kalpas as numerous as ocean drops. Do not take samaya lightly!

Emaho!

[11906-11930]
Some cling to the blissful experiences, wanting them to continue forever. When they fade, they become depressed. This is attachment to samsara, even within the path of liberation. All experiences are impermanent—even the bliss of meditation.

[11914-11928]
: at death, unclear sky with fading light like western sunset, dead sun and moon, yellow clouds covering them, rain falling with subsequent cold, evening rain. These indicate external, internal, sudden, distinctive, inverted, karmic, and enjoyment-obscured preta realms.

Animal-realm signs

[11929-11935]
: at death-transfer, dark and hazy sky without warmth, covered by dark clouds, valley blue with smoke appearance, hazy unpleasant sky. This leads to animals with many legs, no legs, four legs, winged, scaled—countless varieties.

Asura-realm signs

[11931-11955]
The wise practitioner rests in the nature of whatever arises, without accepting or rejecting. Good experiences, bad experiences—all are equally the display of rigpa. This is the supreme conduct.

Emaho!

[11936-11950]
: fierce wind rising from all directions, terrifying dark red cloud-forms appearing, clouds swirling violently with thunder roaring and lightning flashing, sun and moon obscured. Five asura types: five-cornered, six-faced, long-armed, big-bellied, sky-going with matted hair.

God-realm signs

[11951-11963]
: at breath-separation, clear pure sky with bright sun and moon, no wind or dust, directions beautiful and joyful. This leads to six desire-god families, five pure abode gods, fifteen clear light birth-places, four limitless perception entrances.

Human-realm signs

[11956-11980]
In thod rgal practice, conduct is crucial. Do not fall into the extreme of formal discipline, nor into the extreme of recklessness. Like a madman, be free from convention, yet like a wise one, be free from harm.

[11964-11984]
: clear sky without dust, gentle white clouds stretching like silk, sun and moon with rainbow light surrounding—indicating precious human birth in the three higher realms.

Emaho!

[11981-12002]
Eat what comes to you, wear what is given, sleep wherever you are. Do not be attached to comfort or averse to hardship.

[11985-12002]
, but specific exceptions exist. Bad signs—wind, hail, etc.—may be sent by non-human wrathful ones or appear when evil beings die.

[11992-12002]
: these various signs of the three times are definitively established.
