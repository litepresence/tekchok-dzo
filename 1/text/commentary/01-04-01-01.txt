[1902-1943]
Eternalists and nihilists, Samkhyas and Lokāyatas—this hermit held these views himself once. When he believed in a permanent soul, an unchanging self persisting through time—eternalist. When he thought death was the end, nothing continuing—nihilist. The Samkhyas speak of a self-nature hidden in the heart, white and oily, coiled like a serpent

[1913-1935]
. This old practitioner searched for that same self! Looked for the "real me" somewhere inside, some essence truly his. Not there. Never there. The search itself was the delusion.

The Lokāyatas deny past and future lives, action and result

[1944-2004]
. This yogi also denied karma once, thinking actions had no consequences, believing he could harm others without consequence to himself. The materialists say mind arises from elements meeting—heat and moisture producing consciousness like maggots from rotting flesh. This hermit sometimes still feels that way—just chemistry, just biology, just random processes with no deeper meaning.

Longchenpa lists hundreds of wrong views

[2013-2032]
, and this practitioner warns: beware of the nihilistic trap! Some say cause is severed—mind cannot be held as entity. Some say effect is severed—life-force and lordship nonexistent. Some say path is severed—withered, nothing exists. Some say primordial wisdom is severed—Buddha nonexistent

[2023-2092]
, but do not get lost in the catalog. The point is simple: any view grasping at permanence or interruption, establishing something as truly existent or truly non-existent, is a deviation. The only correct view is the view transcending all views—not by negating them, but by seeing through the one who holds them.

This old practitioner is not a Samkhya, not a Lokāyata, not a Buddhist or non-Buddhist. These are clothes to try on. What remains when all costumes are removed? That is what must be discovered.

[2084-2092]
—Kani and jealousy, Bhasira and Kabisha, Sindhara and Dhasim, and all the rest—these are not just ancient Indians! They are this hermit's own mind tendencies. When jealousy arises, he is Kani. When grasping at philosophical positions, he is Bhasira. When thinking meaning is utterly nonexistent, he is Sindhara.

And the sixty branches

[2100-2164]
, and this practitioner feels the urgency! Every one of these three hundred sixty views is a trap he could fall into, a way of thinking promising liberation but delivering only more bondage.

How Longchenpa describes the cutting of flesh, the jumping from cliffs, the burning of bodies with fire

[2100-2164]
, and this hermit hears this as a warning! For every view listed here, there are beings who hold it, who believe it, who will die clinging to it as truth.

The hundred teachers

[2107-2207]
—Jyotiska, the grasper of the nonexistent, Life, the leaf-possessor, Vishnu, and all the rest—each represents a way the conceptual mind tries to capture reality. And each fails! Not because reality is beyond capture, but because there is nothing to capture. The net is cast into empty water.

Some speak of permanence [2208]. Some speak of impermanence [2209]. Some speak of both [2210]. From these, views multiply endlessly. For every assertion, a negation. For every philosophy, a counter-philosophy. This is the nature of conceptual mind—it divides, opposes, debates endlessly.

The tirthikas of various wrongnesses

[2165-2245]
, and the sheer number should overwhelm! Moon-dawners, sun-dawners, hand-eaters, heart-livers, possessors of three aggregates, those who live by two or three

[2165-2175]
—each name represents a whole philosophy, a complete worldview, held sincerely by beings who believe it leads to liberation.

And the seventy, eighty, ninety

[2176-2207]
—owls, forest dwellers, dog-possessors, dwellers on riverbanks, garment-piece possessors—on and on it goes. For every way of thinking, a school. For every limitation, a doctrine turning that limitation into the path.

The Samkhyas hold that atoms, darkness, and three energies are permanent

[2246-2283]
—the Samkhyas with their atoms and darkness, the Vaisesikas with their minute atoms, Kumaralabha saying mind is nonexistent, Karnaputra holding appearance as permanent—these debates continue today! Only the names have changed. Philosophers still argue about whether reality is material or mental, whether consciousness emerges from matter or matter from consciousness.

But all miss the point! Like people arguing about the color of the hat of someone who does not exist. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. When searching for the grasper, the searcher, the philosopher—where is it? In the brain? In the mind? In the heart? Search thoroughly, and find nothing solid, nothing stable, nothing persisting.

This "nothing found" is not nihilism. It is the doorway to recognition. Not finding a self, one need not construct a non-self. Simply rest in the openness of not-finding. That is freedom from all three hundred sixty views and the countless others not named.

[2246-2254]
. They believe delusion is the basis of action, attachment produces happiness, anger turns back armies. This is strategic spirituality! Use the afflictions as tools. But does it work? Can anger really be controlled, used precisely, without burning the one who wields it?

The Vaisesikas view outer aggregates as minute atoms

[2255-2262]
—the building blocks of reality. They count these atoms, analyze them, believe they have found the fundamental nature of things. This is the scientific impulse! Reduce everything to smallest parts, understand the parts, understand the whole. But who understands? What is the nature of the understanding itself?

Kumaralabha says mind is nonexistent, body is nonexistent

[2263-2266]
. When body is abandoned, all is empty. This is nihilism pure and simple. If all is empty and nonexistent, why practice? Why care? This view leads to despair, to rejection of all meaning.

Karnaputra sees appearance as permanent through circumstances

[2267-2271]
, yet holds ultimate appearance as impermanent. This is confusion! Mixing permanence and impermanence without clear understanding, creating a muddle satisfying no one.

And the secret teachings of the five fires

[2272-2283]
—sending lamps, burning the body, cooking with sandalwood, wrapping in fire-cloth—these are not metaphorical! People actually did these things, believing extreme asceticism would purify karma. But delusion cannot be burned away with outer fire. Only the fire of wisdom, the flame of recognition, can do that.

All these views

[2273-2283]
—these extreme ascetic practices performed in the name of spirituality. This old practitioner may not wrap himself in cloth soaked with sesame oil and set himself ablaze, but what does he do to himself in the name of practice? Pushing until breaking? Making spiritual life another form of self-punishment?

The tirthikas who declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed

[2284-2315]
—flesh removed, body placed in holes, feeding worms, dog conduct, and all the rest. Reading this, one thinks "How primitive! How misguided!" But this hermit looks at himself—what is he doing to his body in the name of spirituality?

Pushing through pain until damage? Denying sleep, food, comfort, believing this will purify? Making the body an enemy to be conquered? This is the same error! The body is not the obstacle. The obstacle is grasping at the body as "mine," as self, as something to punish or reward.

Those who "enter dog conduct" [2288]—literally imitating dogs, eating like dogs, behaving like dogs—believing this leads to liberation. Mistaken conduct, yes! But why? Not because dogs are low, but because imitation is not transformation. One cannot become liberated by acting like something else, whether that something is a dog or a Buddha.

The agent cause theory

[2289-2295]
—like a carpenter making different forms—the belief that one can shape oneself through will and effort. There is truth here! Effort is necessary. Discipline is required. But the error is thinking the agent is solid, permanent, real. The carpenter is as empty as the forms he creates.

Those who take conduct as permanent yet see cause and result as impermanent

[2316-2324]
—this is the inconsistency Longchenpa warns against! One cannot have it both ways. Cannot say the path is eternal while the walking of it is not. Cannot say practice matters while results do not exist. This is confusion, not wisdom.

And those who "wield evil mantras as chief" [2324]—using spiritual power to harm, to destroy, to get what they want. Is this old practitioner not also doing this when praying for enemies to fail, using practice to feel superior, manipulating others with spiritual language? The form is different, but the essence is the same.

The attachment to this world

[2324-2335]
—called "worldly benefit"—this is where most practitioners remain. Practicing for health, wealth, success, good relationships. Nothing wrong with these! But do not mistake them for the path. They are byproducts, not the goal.

All these wrong views [2421] gather into permanence and interruption. But the Middle Way avoids both. Not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition cutting through all three hundred sixty views in a single stroke.

[2335-2376]
, and this practitioner feels the urgency! Every view described here is a trap, and he is caught in many of them.

Those who "declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed, primordial wisdom severed" [2350]—this is nihilism disguised as Dzogchen! Hearing that all is empty and concluding nothing matters. Learning that the nature of mind is beyond cause and effect and deciding actions have no consequences. This is worse than eternalist views! At least eternalists believe in virtue.

"Buddha nonexistent" [2356]—when saying this, does one understand what is being said? If Buddha nature is nonexistent, why practice? If awakening is impossible, why bother? This is not the teaching of emptiness; this is the denial of the Buddha's own attainment.

Those severed while abiding on the path who "declare the effect definitely severed" [2356]—practitioners who have fallen into despair. They practiced, tried, did not get the results they wanted, so they conclude liberation is impossible. This hermit has had these moments. Do not become one of these.

"Severance is emptiness—you are severed, I am severed—therefore nothing exists" [2356]—this is the worst kind of pseudo-wisdom! Taking the profound teaching of emptiness and turning it into an excuse for laziness, for immorality, for giving up.

The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent. Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties"—these are not realized beings! They are intellectuals playing with concepts. They construct elaborate philosophies satisfying the mind but not transforming the heart.

And the tirthikas who deviate

[2350-2364]
—these are not just ancient heretics. They are this hermit's own mind when giving up, when saying "nothing matters," when falling into nihilism disguised as wisdom. Beware! The true Dharma never severs anything. It reveals there was never anything to sever.

When Longchenpa speaks of those who "wield evil mantras as chief, performing fierce destructive rites" [2324], or those who "take divination and prophecy as chief, caring only for this world's happiness" [2324], he warns about spiritual materialism. Is this old practitioner using practice to get what he wants? To harm enemies? To predict the future? Then he has become what is described.

The four types he identifies—extreme view, extreme end, distant benefit, indifference

[2350-2356]
.

This is the extreme of nihilism dressed as wisdom! Taking the teaching of emptiness and turning it into nothingness. Saying "all is severed, all is cut, all is empty of meaning." But this is not the Middle Way—it is a deviation into darkness.

When Longchenpa speaks of those who "declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut" [2335], he warns about this hermit's own mind! Moments of despair when thinking "nothing matters, nothing exists, why practice?" This is the severance view arising. It feels like liberation—no more responsibility, no more effort, no more path. But it is actually just another form of grasping, another extreme to be transcended.

The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent"—these are not realized beings! They are those who have misunderstood the teaching. They grasp at the words "emptiness" and "severance" without realizing their true meaning.

True emptiness is not severance. It is not the cutting of connections, the denial of appearances, the rejection of causality. True emptiness is the recognition that appearances and emptiness are inseparable, that cause and effect function without inherent existence, that the path is walked without a walker.

Those who deviate from consistency are called tirthikas [2364]—but Buddhists who deviate are merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet. The form remains Buddhist, but the essence has become heresy. Beware of this! One can wear the robes, practice the rituals, quote the scriptures, and still hold a view contradicting the Dharma's heart.

The Middle Way avoids both extremes: not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that liberates—not the severance that destroys.

[2364-2376]
—those who think all is magic, those who say anger finishes spirits, those who say the mind is self-arisen and uncorrectable, those who say meditating on deity-body is sufficient. Each of these is a deviation one might fall into! The one who thinks practice does not matter because "all is illusion." The one who justifies anger as "wrathful activity." The one who believes they are already enlightened so no correction is needed.

Beware! The path is narrow. The deviations are countless. At every step, ego finds a way to co-opt the teaching. The work is not to avoid all these views—impossible! The work is to recognize the one who holds views, the one who deviates, and see that it too is empty. Then all views are simultaneously liberated.

[2376-2396]
—Kani-pa, Sersnawa, Sambhari, Kabhisha, Sindha, Dhasimba, Katipa, Sangha, Shamkari, Doshaka—and this practitioner does not dismiss these as merely historical!

Kani-pa: those who wish for meaning indifferently [2376]. Is this old practitioner not sometimes this? Wanting awakening, but wanting it casually, without urgency, without commitment. Practicing when convenient, when feeling like it, when it does not interfere with other desires. This is indifference, and it leads nowhere.

Sersnawa: possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances and emptiness [2376]. This is this hermit when approaching the teachings! Wanting liberation, but terrified of what will be lost. Wanting to transcend the ego, but clinging to its comforts. The fear of emptiness paralyzes, keeps one circling the teaching but never entering.

Kabhisha: those who think neither special meaning nor common meaning exists [2381]. This is the nihilist again, denying all significance, all purpose. If neither ordinary life nor spiritual practice matters, why do anything? This view leads to paralysis, to depression, to rejection of all effort.

Sindha: those who think common meaning nonexistent, yet special meaning exists [2381]. This is spiritual elitism! Rejecting ordinary life while grasping at spiritual achievement. Becoming a practitioner looking down on "worldly" people, believing the path makes one superior. This pride is worse than worldly vanity.

And so on, through Dhasimba who thinks meaning utterly nonexistent, Katipa who thinks meaning exists until breath is cut, Sangha who thinks entering the Sangha's feature is sufficient

[2381-2392]
. Each represents a way mind limits itself, creates a box, and calls it truth.

The truth of compounded impermanence, the truth of life-force and lordship

[2392-2396]
—these are the alternatives offered, the correct views leading to liberation. But even these can be grasped! Even the four seals can become a new prison if held rigidly.

The point is not to find the right view among all these. The point is to see through viewing itself. When the viewer is seen as empty, all views—right and wrong, correct and mistaken—are simultaneously liberated into their true nature.

[2396-2428]
, gathering them into two, then four, showing how the countless philosophical positions all derive from grasping at permanence or interruption.

"Extreme view" refers to eternal permanence [2401]—the belief in something lasting forever, unchanging, truly existent. This is the comfort of the ego! Wanting to believe in a soul, a self, something persisting. Wanting to believe in a God solid and reliable. Wanting to believe in truths never changing.

"Extreme end" declares permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent—both [2401]. This is the attempt to have it both ways, to acknowledge change while still grasping at permanence. It satisfies the intellect but leaves the heart confused.

"Distant benefit": half permanent, half interrupted [2401]. This is the compromiser, the one saying "some things last, some things do not." It seems reasonable, moderate, balanced. But it is still dualistic grasping!

"Indifference": completely interrupted [2401]. This is nihilism—the belief that nothing lasts, nothing matters, everything ends in annihilation. This is despair, the rejection of all meaning, the denial of continuity.

These four gather into permanence and interruption

[2401-2411]
—cover all the mistakes. Eternal permanence at one pole, complete annihilation at the other, with various compromises in between. Where does this hermit stand? Probably oscillating between them, sometimes believing in something permanent, sometimes believing in nothing at all.

The purpose of teaching all this [2425] is so one does not enter wrong paths. But how to know what is wrong? Wrong is anything requiring grasping at a view, establishing a position, becoming something. The right path is the path dissolving the path-walker, revealing no one ever needed to go anywhere.

So read these lists not as history but as diagnosis. Find one's own tendencies here. Then let them go. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. Rest there.

[2401-2421]
. And these two are the fundamental error! The mind dividing reality into existing and not-existing, into lasting and ceasing, into being and non-being—this is the mind that suffers. For what exists can be lost. What does not exist can be regretted. What lasts must end. What ceases might have continued.

The Buddha's teaching transcends both! Not by mixing them, not by finding a middle point between them, but by seeing through the one who holds them. Who believes in permanence? Who fears interruption? Search for this one, and it cannot be found. The searcher itself is unfindable.

Thus the purpose of teaching these views [2425]: not entering through recognizing wrong paths. But the recognition must be direct, not merely intellectual. One must feel in the bones the futility of all positions, the impossibility of capturing reality in concepts. Then, and only then, does one stop grasping at views and rest in what is beyond all view.

[2421-2425]
gather into four types, then into two—permanence and interruption—and finally, all are wrong paths to avoid. But how to avoid them? Not by adopting the opposite view! Avoid them by seeing through the one who holds views, the one who establishes positions, the one who believes and disbelieves. When that one is seen through, all views are simultaneously liberated.

[2430-2474]
, and here one must pay sharp attention! The difference between worldly and transcendent is not a matter of doing different things—it is a matter of completely different seeing.

The four seals distinguishing the Buddha's teaching [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful—these are not beliefs to adopt. They are facts to be recognized. Look at one's own experience! Is anything grasped permanent? Does anything stained by attachment bring lasting satisfaction? Can a self be found in all the searching? When struggling stops, is there not peace?

Longchenpa speaks of the vehicle "like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space does not reject anything. It holds all without preference. This is how the bodhisattva's mind must become—vast enough to include all beings, all sufferings, all joys, without being moved from natural openness.

The nine vehicles

[2430-2474]
. This is the turning point! Everything before was what to avoid. Now entering what to practice.

"Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates" [2428]. This is the Buddha's compassion! He did not teach wrong views to confuse, but to protect. Like a parent pointing out all the dangerous animals so the child knows what to avoid, Longchenpa has shown the philosophical pitfalls.

The transcendent vehicle is superior because of the four seals [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful. And because of refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha showing the way, the Dharma being the way, the Sangha walking the way. These the outsiders lack! They have their gods, their scriptures, their communities, but not the Three Jewels leading beyond all conditioning.

The essence of the transcendent vehicle: "supreme method of definitely exiting samsara" [2446]. Not merely improving samsara, not merely making it more comfortable, but exiting entirely! This is the difference between worldly and transcendent spirituality. One wants better circumstances; the other recognizes circumstances themselves are the problem.

From the Compendium: "mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue. This vehicle like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space holds everything without preference. The Great Vehicle includes everything without discrimination. It is vast enough for all beings, all paths, all methods.

The nine vehicles

[2475-2502]
are not rungs on a ladder to climb one by one. They are descriptions of how different minds approach the truth. If one has lesser faculties, the gradual approaches of the lower vehicles may be needed. If the mind is sharp, one may go directly to Dzogchen. But do not pride oneself on being "higher"! The pride itself places one lower. The humble practitioner of the lowest vehicle who genuinely transforms the mind surpasses the arrogant Dzogchenpa who merely thinks they are supreme.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo: "By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages"

[2475-2502]
are taught according to faculties—listener, self-enlightened, bodhisattva for the inferior; Kriya, Upa, Yoga for the medium; Maha, Anu, Ati for the sharp. But do not think this means one must start at the bottom and climb! It means teachings are available for every level of capacity. Find where one is, practice accordingly, and progress naturally.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo

[2475-2538]
, and one must find oneself among them! These are not abstract categories—they describe living approaches to awakening practiced by real beings right now.

The three inferior vehicles: listener (sravaka), self-enlightened (pratyekabuddha), and bodhisattva

[2476-2477]
. These are the sutra vehicles, the path of characteristics. They emphasize renunciation, compassion, and the gradual cultivation of merit and wisdom. If the mind is drawn to systematic practice, to step-by-step progress, to clear stages and measurable attainments—these paths are suitable.

The three medium vehicles: Kriya, Upa (Charya), and Yoga

[2478-2479]
. These are the outer tantras, the path of transformation through ritual and visualization. Kriya emphasizes purity and cleanliness, maintaining distance from the deity. Upa brings deity and practitioner closer. Yoga unites them in meditation. If one is drawn to ritual, to mantra, to working with energy and channels—these paths call.

The three great vehicles: Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga

[2480-2481]
. These are the inner tantras, the path of direct recognition. Maha Yoga works with the generation stage, creating the mandala through visualization. Anu Yoga works with the completion stage, the subtle body practices. Ati Yoga—Dzogchen—is the direct recognition of the nature of mind itself, beyond all fabrication.

But hear this: the vehicles are not hierarchical in the sense that higher is better! They are hierarchical in the sense of directness. A humble practitioner of the listener vehicle who genuinely practices may be closer to awakening than a Dzogchen practitioner who merely thinks they are supreme.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo

[2496-2522]
: "The Dharmas I taught from beings' mind stages, by differences of great and small, taught as two-stage method." The teachings emerge from the needs of beings, not from the Buddha's preference. They are skillful means, appropriate to the recipient. What matters is not which vehicle one follows, but whether one follows it to its completion.

[2496-2522]
: "Inverted and correct view. By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages—small mind and great, and thus medium mind possessed, taught as three-stage method." The difference between wandering and liberation is not the vehicle followed, but whether realization is correct or inverted. Correct realization sees through the self. Inverted realization grasps at something.

So do not aspire to the "highest" vehicle! Aspire to genuine recognition, whatever vehicle is practiced. And if drawn to Ati Yoga, to Dzogchen, approach it with humility, with devotion, with the accumulation of merit and wisdom preparing the ground.

[2502-2508]
. One is always realizing something. The question is: is the realization correct or incorrect? Correct realization sees through the self and rests naturally. Incorrect realization grasps at something—experience, view, status—and builds a new prison.

The small, medium, and great stages correspond to how much of the self has been seen through. Small stage: understanding intellectually but still grasping at appearances. Medium: seeing through outer appearances but grasping at mind itself. Great: even the grasping at mind dissolves, and what remains is what was always there.

Do not compare oneself to these stages. Simply look: what is grasping right now? Release that, and one is already beyond all vehicles.

[2523-2538]
—all the Word gathered in three baskets, the twenty-one thousand, the eighty-four thousand dharma heaps. This is vast! But do not be overwhelmed.

The three baskets: Sutra (the discourses), Vinaya (discipline), and Abhidharma (higher knowledge). These contain everything the Buddha taught, organized for study and practice. And the tantras—the manifest great, the secret teachings revealing what the sutras hint at. All of these are medicine for different ailments, food for different hungers.

"Regarding each antidote taming beings' thought accumulations, extensively many, inconceivable, transcending expression" [2526]. The teachings are not arbitrary! Each one addresses a specific confusion, a particular obscuration. The Buddha was like a master physician, prescribing different treatments for different conditions. What cures one patient might harm another. What liberates one mind might confuse another.

The categorization into nine vehicles [2538] is not for the sake of division, but for the sake of clarity. Just as a library organizes books so one can find what is needed, the vehicles organize the teachings so one can find what suits the mind. But do not mistake the organization for the reality! The Dharma is one taste—liberation. The vehicles are fingers pointing at that moon.

The hearer vehicle explained in five aspects: essence, definition, purpose, fruit, and division [2538]. This systematic presentation is characteristic of Longchenpa's scholarship—thorough, comprehensive, leaving no room for confusion. But scholarship alone does not liberate! One must take these teachings into practice, into life, into very being.

The Vaibhasika and Sautrantika divisions [2538]—these are not merely historical schools. They represent approaches to understanding still present today. The analytical mind wanting to break everything down into parts (Vaibhasika) versus the fluid mind seeing everything as process (Sautrantika). Both have value. Both have limitations.

What matters is not which school one belongs to, but whether one practices genuinely, whether the teachings are applied to transform the mind. A simple practitioner who meditates daily is superior to a scholar who knows all the classifications but does not practice.

[2526-2538]
may seem like ancient history, but their debates live in this hermit's own mind. The Vaibhasikas hold to dust-atoms, partless particles composing reality [2549].

[2538-2538]
, and this old practitioner warns: do not look down on it!
