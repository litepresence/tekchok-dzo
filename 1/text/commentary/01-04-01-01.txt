[1902-1943]
Eternalists and nihilists, Samkhyas and Lokāyatas—you think these are ancient philosophies you can dismiss? No! You hold these views yourself! When you believe in a permanent soul, an unchanging self that persists through time, you are eternalist. When you think death is the end, that nothing continues, you are nihilist. The Samkhyas speak of a self-nature hidden in the heart, white and oily, coiled like a serpent

[1913-1935]
. You search for this same self! You look for the "real you" somewhere inside, some essence that is truly yours. It is not there. It has never been there. The search itself is the delusion.

The Lokāyatas deny past and future lives, action and result

[1944-2004]
. You also deny karma when you think your actions have no consequences, when you believe you can harm others without consequence to yourself. The materialists say mind arises from elements meeting—heat and moisture producing consciousness like maggots from rotting flesh. Do you not sometimes feel this way? That you are just chemistry, just biology, just random processes with no deeper meaning?

Longchenpa lists hundreds of wrong views

[2013-2032]
, and you must beware of this nihilistic trap! Some say cause is severed—mind cannot be held as entity. Some say effect is severed—life-force and lordship nonexistent. Some say path is severed—withered, nothing exists. Some say primordial wisdom is severed—Buddha nonexistent

[2023-2092]
, but do not get lost in the catalog. The point is simple: any view that grasps at permanence or interruption, that establishes something as truly existent or truly non-existent, is a deviation. The only correct view is the view that transcends all views—not by negating them, but by seeing through the one who holds them.

You are not a Samkhya, not a Lokāyata, not a Buddhist or non-Buddhist. These are clothes you try on. What remains when all costumes are removed? That is what you must discover.

[2084-2092]
—Kani and jealousy, Bhasira and Kabisha, Sindhara and Dhasim, and all the rest—these are not just ancient Indians! They are your own mind's tendencies. When you feel jealousy, you are Kani. When you grasp at philosophical positions, you are Bhasira. When you think meaning is utterly nonexistent, you are Sindhara.

And the sixty branches

[2100-2164]
, and you must feel the urgency here! Every one of these three hundred sixty views is a trap you could fall into, a way of thinking that promises liberation but delivers only more bondage.

Look at how he describes the cutting of flesh, the jumping from cliffs, the burning of bodies with fire

[2100-2164]
, and you must hear this as a warning! For every view listed here, there are beings who hold it, who believe it, who will die clinging to it as truth.

The hundred teachers

[2107-2207]
—Jyotiska, the grasper of the nonexistent, Life, the leaf-possessor, Vishnu, and all the rest—each represents a way that the conceptual mind tries to capture reality. And each fails! Not because reality is beyond capture, but because there is nothing to capture. The net is cast into empty water.

Some speak of permanence [2208]. Some speak of impermanence [2209]. Some speak of both [2210]. From these, the views multiply endlessly. For every assertion, there is a negation. For every philosophy, there is a counter-philosophy. This is the nature of conceptual mind—it divides, it opposes, it debates endlessly.

The tirthikas of various wrongnesses

[2165-2245]
, and the sheer number should overwhelm you! Moon-dawners, sun-dawners, hand-eaters, heart-livers, possessors of three aggregates, those who live by two or three

[2165-2175]
—each name represents a whole philosophy, a complete worldview, held sincerely by beings who believe it leads to liberation.

And the seventy, eighty, ninety

[2176-2207]
—owls, forest dwellers, dog-possessors, dwellers on riverbanks, garment-piece possessors—on and on it goes. For every way of thinking, there is a school. For every limitation, there is a doctrine that turns that limitation into the path.

The Samkhyas hold that atoms, darkness, and three energies are permanent

[2246-2283]
—the Samkhyas with their atoms and darkness, the Vaisesikas with their minute atoms, Kumaralabha saying mind is nonexistent, Karnaputra holding appearance as permanent—these debates continue today! Only the names have changed. Philosophers still argue about whether reality is material or mental, whether consciousness emerges from matter or matter from consciousness.

But all of them miss the point! They are like people arguing about the color of the hat of someone who doesn't exist. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. When you search for the grasper, the searcher, the philosopher—where is it? In the brain? In the mind? In the heart? Search thoroughly, and you find nothing solid, nothing stable, nothing that persists.

This "nothing found" is not nihilism. It is the doorway to recognition. Not finding a self, you need not construct a non-self. Simply rest in the openness of not-finding. That is freedom from all three hundred sixty views and the countless others not named.

[2246-2254]
. They believe that delusion is the basis of action, attachment produces happiness, anger turns back armies. This is strategic spirituality! Use the afflictions as tools. But does it work? Can you really control anger, use it precisely, and not be burned?

The Vaisesikas view outer aggregates as minute atoms

[2255-2262]
—the building blocks of reality. They count these atoms, analyze them, believe they have found the fundamental nature of things. This is the scientific impulse! Reduce everything to smallest parts, understand the parts, and you understand the whole. But who understands? What is the nature of the understanding itself?

Kumaralabha says mind is nonexistent, body is nonexistent

[2263-2266]
. When body is abandoned, all is empty. This is nihilism pure and simple. If all is empty and nonexistent, why practice? Why care? This view leads to despair, to the rejection of all meaning.

Karnaputra sees appearance as permanent through circumstances

[2267-2271]
, yet holds ultimate appearance as impermanent. This is confusion! Mixing permanence and impermanence without clear understanding, creating a muddle that satisfies no one.

And the secret teachings of the five fires

[2272-2283]
—sending lamps, burning the body, cooking with sandalwood, wrapping in fire-cloth—these are not metaphorical! People actually did these things, believing extreme asceticism would purify karma. But you cannot burn away delusion with outer fire. Only the fire of wisdom, the flame of recognition, can do that.

All these views

[2273-2283]
—these extreme ascetic practices performed in the name of spirituality. You may not be wrapping yourself in cloth soaked with sesame oil and setting yourself ablaze, but what are you doing to yourself in the name of practice? Are you pushing until you break? Are you making your spiritual life another form of self-punishment?

The tirthikas who declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed

[2284-2315]
—flesh removed, body placed in holes, feeding worms, dog conduct, and all the rest. You read this and think "How primitive! How misguided!" But look at yourself—what are you doing to your body in the name of spirituality?

Are you pushing through pain until you damage yourself? Are you denying sleep, food, comfort, believing this will purify you? Are you making your body an enemy to be conquered? This is the same error! The body is not the obstacle. The obstacle is the grasping at the body as "mine," as self, as something to punish or reward.

Those who "enter dog conduct" [2288]—literally imitating dogs, eating like dogs, behaving like dogs—believing this will lead to liberation. This is mistaken conduct, yes! But why? Not because dogs are low, but because imitation is not transformation. You cannot become liberated by acting like something else, whether that something is a dog or a Buddha.

The agent cause theory

[2289-2295]
—like a carpenter making different forms—the belief that you can shape yourself through will and effort. There is truth here! Effort is necessary. Discipline is required. But the error is thinking the agent is solid, permanent, real. The carpenter is as empty as the forms he creates.

Those who take conduct as permanent yet see cause and result as impermanent

[2316-2324]
—this is the inconsistency Longchenpa warns against! You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say the path is eternal while the walking of it is not. You cannot say practice matters while results don't exist. This is confusion, not wisdom.

And those who "wield evil mantras as chief" [2324]—using spiritual power to harm, to destroy, to get what they want. Are you not also doing this when you pray for your enemies to fail, when you use your practice to feel superior, when you manipulate others with spiritual language? The form is different, but the essence is the same.

The attachment to this world

[2324-2335]
—called "worldly benefit"—this is where most practitioners remain. They practice for health, wealth, success, good relationships. Nothing wrong with these! But do not mistake them for the path. They are the byproducts, not the goal.

All these wrong views [2421] gather into permanence and interruption. But the Middle Way avoids both. Not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that cuts through all three hundred sixty views in a single stroke.

[2335-2376]
, and you must feel the urgency! Every view described here is a trap, and you are caught in many of them.

Those who "declare cause severed, effect severed, path severed, primordial wisdom severed" [2350]—this is nihilism disguised as Dzogchen! They hear that all is empty and conclude that nothing matters. They learn that the nature of mind is beyond cause and effect and decide that actions have no consequences. This is worse than the eternalist views! At least the eternalists believe in virtue.

"Buddha nonexistent" [2356]—when you say this, do you understand what you are saying? If Buddha nature is nonexistent, why practice? If awakening is impossible, why bother? This is not the teaching of emptiness; this is the denial of the Buddha's own attainment.

Those severed while abiding on the path who "declare the effect definitely severed" [2356]—these are practitioners who have fallen into despair. They practiced, they tried, they did not get the results they wanted, so they conclude liberation is impossible. Do not become one of these!

"Severance is emptiness—you are severed, I am severed—therefore nothing exists" [2356]—this is the worst kind of pseudo-wisdom! Taking the profound teaching of emptiness and turning it into an excuse for laziness, for immorality, for giving up.

The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent. Slight parts exist, suitable for appearance to faculties"—these are not realized beings! They are intellectuals playing with concepts. They construct elaborate philosophies that satisfy the mind but do not transform the heart.

And the tirthikas who deviate

[2350-2364]
—these are not just ancient heretics. They are your own mind when it gives up, when it says "nothing matters," when it falls into nihilism disguised as wisdom. Beware! The true Dharma never severs anything. It reveals that there was never anything to sever.

When Longchenpa speaks of those who "wield evil mantras as chief, performing fierce destructive rites" [2324], or those who "take divination and prophecy as chief, caring only for this world's happiness" [2324], he is warning you about spiritual materialism. Are you using practice to get what you want? To harm your enemies? To predict the future? Then you have become what he describes.

The four types he identifies—extreme view, extreme end, distant benefit, indifference

[2350-2356]
.

This is the extreme of nihilism dressed as wisdom! They take the teaching of emptiness and turn it into nothingness. They say "all is severed, all is cut, all is empty of meaning." But this is not the Middle Way—it is a deviation into darkness.

When Longchenpa speaks of those who "declare cause severed, like space, suddenly cut" [2335], he is warning you about your own mind! Have you not had moments of despair when you thought "nothing matters, nothing exists, why practice?" This is the severance view arising in you. It feels like liberation—no more responsibility, no more effort, no more path. But it is actually just another form of grasping, another extreme to be transcended.

The knowers who speak secretly [2359]—"Meaning, like space, is emptiness, completely severed; existent as entity, nonexistent"—these are not realized beings! They are those who have misunderstood the teaching. They grasp at the words "emptiness" and "severance" without realizing their true meaning.

True emptiness is not severance. It is not the cutting of connections, the denial of appearances, the rejection of causality. True emptiness is the recognition that appearances and emptiness are inseparable, that cause and effect function without inherent existence, that the path is walked without a walker.

Those who deviate from consistency are called tirthikas [2364]—but Buddhists who deviate are merely flesh deviating through wrong tenet. The form remains Buddhist, but the essence has become heresy. Beware of this! You can wear the robes, practice the rituals, quote the scriptures, and still hold a view that contradicts the Dharma's heart.

The Middle Way avoids both extremes: not grasping at existence, not grasping at non-existence. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Emptiness appears as cause and effect. This is the recognition that liberates—not the severance that destroys.

[2364-2376]
—those who think all is magic, those who say anger finishes spirits, those who say the mind is self-arisen and uncorrectable, those who say meditating on deity-body is sufficient. Each of these is a deviation you might fall into! The one who thinks practice doesn't matter because "all is illusion." The one who justifies anger as "wrathful activity." The one who believes they are already enlightened so no correction is needed.

Beware! The path is narrow. The deviations are countless. At every step, ego finds a way to co-opt the teaching. Your job is not to avoid all these views—impossible! Your job is to recognize the one who holds views, the one who deviates, and see that it too is empty. Then all views are simultaneously liberated.

[2376-2396]
—Kani-pa, Sersnawa, Sambhari, Kabhisha, Sindha, Dhasimba, Katipa, Sangha, Shamkari, Doshaka—and you must not dismiss these as merely historical!

Kani-pa: those who wish for meaning indifferently [2376]. Are you not sometimes this? You want awakening, but you want it casually, without urgency, without commitment. You practice when convenient, when you feel like it, when it doesn't interfere with other desires. This is indifference, and it leads nowhere.

Sersnawa: possessed of suffering, fearing diminished appearances and emptiness [2376]. This is you when you approach the teachings! You want liberation, but you are terrified of what you will lose. You want to transcend the ego, but you cling to its comforts. The fear of emptiness paralyzes you, keeps you circling the teaching but never entering.

Kabhisha: those who think neither special meaning nor common meaning exists [2381]. This is the nihilist again, denying all significance, all purpose. If neither ordinary life nor spiritual practice matters, why do anything? This view leads to paralysis, to depression, to the rejection of all effort.

Sindha: those who think common meaning nonexistent, yet special meaning exists [2381]. This is spiritual elitism! You reject ordinary life while grasping at spiritual achievement. You become a practitioner who looks down on "worldly" people, who believes your path makes you superior. This pride is worse than worldly vanity.

And so on, through Dhasimba who thinks meaning utterly nonexistent, Katipa who thinks meaning exists until breath is cut, Sangha who thinks entering the Sangha's feature is sufficient

[2381-2392]
. Each represents a way that mind limits itself, creates a box, and calls it the truth.

The truth of compounded impermanence, the truth of life-force and lordship

[2392-2396]
—these are the alternatives offered, the correct views that lead to liberation. But even these can be grasped! Even the four seals can become a new prison if you hold them rigidly.

The point is not to find the right view among all these. The point is to see through viewing itself. When the viewer is seen as empty, all views—right and wrong, correct and mistaken—are simultaneously liberated into their true nature.

[2396-2428]
, gathering them into two, then four, showing how the countless philosophical positions all derive from grasping at permanence or interruption.

"Extreme view" refers to eternal permanence [2401]—the belief in something that lasts forever, unchanging, truly existent. This is the comfort of the ego! You want to believe you have a soul, a self, something that will persist. You want to believe in a God who is solid and reliable. You want to believe in truths that never change.

"Extreme end" declares permanent is permanent, impermanent is impermanent—both [2401]. This is the attempt to have it both ways, to acknowledge change while still grasping at permanence. It satisfies the intellect but leaves the heart confused.

"Distant benefit": half permanent, half interrupted [2401]. This is the compromiser, the one who says "some things last, some things don't." It seems reasonable, moderate, balanced. But it is still dualistic grasping!

"Indifference": completely interrupted [2401]. This is nihilism—the belief that nothing lasts, nothing matters, everything ends in annihilation. This is despair, the rejection of all meaning, the denial of continuity.

These four gather into permanence and interruption

[2401-2411]
—cover all the mistakes. Eternal permanence at one pole, complete annihilation at the other, with various compromises in between. Where do you stand? Probably you oscillate between them, sometimes believing in something permanent, sometimes believing in nothing at all.

The purpose of teaching all this [2425] is so you do not enter wrong paths. But how do you know what is wrong? Wrong is anything that requires you to grasp at a view, to establish a position, to become something. The right path is the path that dissolves the path-walker, that reveals no one ever needed to go anywhere.

So read these lists not as history but as diagnosis. Find your own tendencies here. Then let them go. The views are countless, but the one who views is not to be found. Rest there.

[2401-2421]
. And these two are the fundamental error! The mind that divides reality into existing and not-existing, into lasting and ceasing, into being and non-being—this is the mind that suffers. For what exists can be lost. What does not exist can be regretted. What lasts must end. What ceases might have continued.

The Buddha's teaching transcends both! Not by mixing them, not by finding a middle point between them, but by seeing through the one who holds them. Who is it that believes in permanence? Who is it that fears interruption? Search for this one, and you cannot find it. The searcher itself is unfindable.

Thus the purpose of teaching these views [2425]: not entering through recognizing wrong paths. But the recognition must be direct, not merely intellectual. You must feel in your bones the futility of all positions, the impossibility of capturing reality in concepts. Then, and only then, do you stop grasping at views and rest in what is beyond all view.

[2421-2425]
gather into four types, then into two—permanence and interruption—and finally, all are wrong paths to avoid. But how do you avoid them? Not by adopting the opposite view! You avoid them by seeing through the one who holds views, the one who establishes positions, the one who believes and disbelieves. When that one is seen through, all views are simultaneously liberated.

[2430-2474]
, and here you must pay sharp attention! The difference between worldly and transcendent is not a matter of doing different things—it is a matter of completely different seeing.

The four seals that distinguish the Buddha's teaching [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful—these are not beliefs to adopt. They are facts to be recognized. Look at your own experience! Is anything you grasp permanent? Does anything stained by attachment bring lasting satisfaction? Can you find a self in all your searching? When you stop struggling, is there not peace?

Longchenpa speaks of the vehicle "like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space does not reject anything. It holds all without preference. This is how the bodhisattva's mind must become—vast enough to include all beings, all sufferings, all joys, without being moved from its natural openness.

The nine vehicles

[2430-2474]
. This is the turning point! Everything before was what to avoid. Now we enter what to practice.

"Son of the clan, fearing you enter wrong paths, I gathered and taught these many views of aggregates" [2428]. This is the Buddha's compassion! He did not teach the wrong views to confuse you, but to protect you. Like a parent who points out all the dangerous animals so the child knows what to avoid, Longchenpa has shown you the philosophical pitfalls.

The transcendent vehicle is superior because of the four seals [2434]: all compounded things impermanent, all defiled things suffering, all dharmas empty and selfless, liberation peaceful. And because of refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha who showed the way, the Dharma that is the way, the Sangha that walks the way. These the outsiders lack! They have their gods, their scriptures, their communities, but not the Three Jewels that lead beyond all conditioning.

The essence of the transcendent vehicle: "supreme method of definitely exiting samsara" [2446]. Not merely improving samsara, not merely making it more comfortable, but exiting entirely! This is the difference between worldly and transcendent spirituality. One wants better circumstances; the other recognizes circumstances themselves are the problem.

From the Compendium: "mounting that, all beings reverse suffering—joy, happiness, bliss, accomplishing supreme virtue. This vehicle like space, a measureless great palace" [2446]. Space holds everything without preference. The Great Vehicle includes everything without discrimination. It is vast enough for all beings, all paths, all methods.

The nine vehicles

[2475-2502]
are not rungs on a ladder to climb one by one. They are descriptions of how different minds approach the truth. If you have lesser faculties, you may need the gradual approaches of the lower vehicles. If your mind is sharp, you may go directly to Dzogchen. But do not pride yourself on being "higher"! The pride itself places you lower. The humble practitioner of the lowest vehicle who genuinely transforms their mind surpasses the arrogant Dzogchenpa who merely thinks they are supreme.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo: "By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages"

[2475-2502]
are taught according to faculties—listener, self-enlightened, bodhisattva for the inferior; Kriya, Upa, Yoga for the medium; Maha, Anu, Ati for the sharp. But do not think this means you must start at the bottom and climb! It means teachings are available for every level of capacity. Find where you are, practice accordingly, and progress naturally.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo

[2475-2538]
, and you must find yourself among them! These are not abstract categories—they describe living approaches to awakening practiced by real beings right now.

The three inferior vehicles: listener (sravaka), self-enlightened (pratyekabuddha), and bodhisattva

[2476-2477]
. These are the sutra vehicles, the path of characteristics. They emphasize renunciation, compassion, and the gradual cultivation of merit and wisdom. If your mind is drawn to systematic practice, to step-by-step progress, to clear stages and measurable attainments—these paths are for you.

The three medium vehicles: Kriya, Upa (Charya), and Yoga

[2478-2479]
. These are the outer tantras, the path of transformation through ritual and visualization. Kriya emphasizes purity and cleanliness, maintaining distance from the deity. Upa brings deity and practitioner closer. Yoga unites them in meditation. If you are drawn to ritual, to mantra, to working with energy and channels—these paths call to you.

The three great vehicles: Maha, Anu, and Ati Yoga

[2480-2481]
. These are the inner tantras, the path of direct recognition. Maha Yoga works with the generation stage, creating the mandala through visualization. Anu Yoga works with the completion stage, the subtle body practices. Ati Yoga—Dzogchen—is the direct recognition of the nature of mind itself, beyond all fabrication.

But hear this: the vehicles are not hierarchical in the sense that higher is better! They are hierarchical in the sense of directness. A humble practitioner of the listener vehicle who genuinely practices may be closer to awakening than a Dzogchen practitioner who merely thinks they are supreme.

From Ati Kopa Chenpo

[2496-2522]
: "The Dharmas I taught from beings' mind stages, by differences of great and small, taught as two-stage method." The teachings emerge from the needs of beings, not from the Buddha's preference. They are skillful means, appropriate to the recipient. What matters is not which vehicle you follow, but whether you follow it to its completion.

[2496-2522]
: "Inverted and correct view. By wrong realization, dwelling in samsara. Correct: three stages—small mind and great, and thus medium mind possessed, taught as three-stage method." The difference between wandering and liberation is not the vehicle you follow, but whether your realization is correct or inverted. Correct realization sees through the self. Inverted realization grasps at something.

So do not aspire to the "highest" vehicle! Aspire to genuine recognition, whatever vehicle you practice. And if you are drawn to Ati Yoga, to Dzogchen, approach it with humility, with devotion, with the accumulation of merit and wisdom that prepare the ground.

[2502-2508]
. You are always realizing something. The question is: is your realization correct or incorrect? Correct realization sees through the self and rests naturally. Incorrect realization grasps at something—experience, view, status—and builds a new prison.

The small, medium, and great stages correspond to how much of the self you have seen through. Small stage: you understand intellectually but still grasp at appearances. Medium: you see through outer appearances but grasp at mind itself. Great: even the grasping at mind dissolves, and what remains is what was always there.

Do not compare yourself to these stages. Simply look: what is grasping right now? Release that, and you are already beyond all vehicles.

[2523-2538]
—all the Word gathered in three baskets, the twenty-one thousand, the eighty-four thousand dharma heaps. This is vast! But do not be overwhelmed.

The three baskets: Sutra (the discourses), Vinaya (discipline), and Abhidharma (higher knowledge). These contain everything the Buddha taught, organized for study and practice. And the tantras—the manifest great, the secret teachings that reveal what the sutras hint at. All of these are medicine for different ailments, food for different hungers.

"Regarding each antidote taming beings' thought accumulations, extensively many, inconceivable, transcending expression" [2526]. The teachings are not arbitrary! Each one addresses a specific confusion, a particular obscuration. The Buddha was like a master physician, prescribing different treatments for different conditions. What cures one patient might harm another. What liberates one mind might confuse another.

The categorization into nine vehicles [2538] is not for the sake of division, but for the sake of clarity. Just as a library organizes books so you can find what you need, the vehicles organize the teachings so you can find what suits your mind. But do not mistake the organization for the reality! The Dharma is one taste—liberation. The vehicles are fingers pointing at that moon.

The hearer vehicle explained in five aspects: essence, definition, purpose, fruit, and division [2538]. This systematic presentation is characteristic of Longchenpa's scholarship—thorough, comprehensive, leaving no room for confusion. But scholarship alone does not liberate! You must take these teachings into practice, into your life, into your very being.

The Vaibhasika and Sautrantika divisions [2538]—these are not merely historical schools. They represent approaches to understanding that are still present today. The analytical mind that wants to break everything down into parts (Vaibhasika) versus the fluid mind that sees everything as process (Sautrantika). Both have value. Both have limitations.

What matters is not which school you belong to, but whether you practice genuinely, whether you apply the teachings to transform your mind. A simple practitioner who meditates daily is superior to a scholar who knows all the classifications but does not practice.

[2526-2538]
may seem like ancient history, but their debates live in your own mind. The Vaibhasikas hold to dust-atoms, partless particles that compose reality [2549].

[2538-2538]
, and you must not look down on it!
