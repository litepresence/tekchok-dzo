[1902-1920]
Philosophical systems. Nine vehicles. Three yanas within Buddhism. Plus outer paths. This is classification. But classification is not realization. Do not mistake the map for the territory.

[1903-1910]
This old fool once memorized all nine vehicles. He could explain their differences. Their characteristics. Their results. He became a scholar of vehicles. But he did not recognize his own nature. The vehicles drove him further from the destination.

[1905-1910]
The vehicle that carries you to realization becomes an obstacle if you cling to it. This is the trap of philosophical systems. Not just wrong views—right views clung to wrongly. Even Dzogchen becomes a prison if you make it into a philosophy.

[1911-1920]
Therefore. Thus. We classify to clear confusion. Not to build new confusion. The Treasury presents systems in order: Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva. Then outer paths. Then Tantra. Then Dzogchen. Steps on a staircase. But the staircase is not the room at the top.

[1915-1920]
Three words. All vehicles lead here. Stop searching. Recognize.

[1921-1950]
Between the analytical precision of philosophical classification and the stark pointing of direct recognition, Longchenpa weaves the path. Not rejecting the vehicles. Not grasping the vehicle. The boat carries you across, but you do not carry the boat on your back.

[1930-1940]
Devotional recognition. Longchenpa writes from vast compassion. This practitioner feels that compassion. The systems are not enemies. They are medicine for specific diseases. When the disease is cured, put down the medicine. Do not become addicted to medicine.

[1941-1950]
This is the Treasury's unique approach. Scholarly precision without scholarly attachment. Devotional warmth without devotional fixation. Analysis serving recognition, not replacing it. The vast view that holds all vehicles while transcending them all.

[1951-2000]
CUT THROUGH. The very notion of "vehicle" is conceptually proliferated! Liberate it NOW. Where is the vehicle? Where is the traveler? Where is the destination? Cut through all three. Not gradually. Not after study. NOW.

[1960-1975]
A yogi once asked: "Which vehicle is supreme?" He searched for the answer in texts. In teachers. In practices. Finally he looked at his own mind. The question dissolved. The one who asked dissolved. Supreme and non-supreme—both concepts. Both liberated.

[1976-2000]
This is what the Treasury teaches. Not through negation. Through recognition. The vehicles are valid. The paths are valid. The results are valid. But only for the one who has not recognized. Once recognition dawns, where are vehicles? Where are paths? Where is the one who travels?

[2001-2050]
This old practitioner has studied them all. He has practiced them all. Now he practices none. Not out of arrogance. Out of recognition. The practice itself was the obstacle. The study itself was the obstacle. Not because they are wrong. Because they are incomplete without recognition.

[2020-2035]
Rest in the Treasury's vast view. All systems are included. All paths are honored. All results are acknowledged. But the final result—recognition of your own nature—transcends them all. This is Dzogchen. This is the supreme vehicle. Not because it is better. Because it is direct.

[2036-2050]
Between the scholar's analysis and the yogi's recognition, between the devotee's longing and the master's pointing, we find the living Treasury. Read these words. Recognize your nature. Liberate everything. Rest. This is what Longchenpa offers.
