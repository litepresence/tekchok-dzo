[1902-1912]
Eternalists and nihilists, Samkhyas and Lokayatas—this hermit held these views himself once. When he believed in a permanent soul, an unchanging self persisting through time—eternalist. When he thought death was the end, nothing continuing—nihilist. Like a traveler at a fork in the road, choosing one path or the other, both lead away from the destination.

[1913-1935]
The Samkhyas speak of a self-nature hidden in the heart, white and oily, coiled like a serpent. This old practitioner searched for that same self! Looked for the "real me" somewhere inside, some essence truly his. Not there. Never there. The search itself was the delusion. Like searching for a rabbit's horns, the seeking creates what cannot be found.

[1936-1948]
The Lokayatas deny past and future lives, action and result. This yogi also denied karma once, thinking actions had no consequences, believing he could harm others without consequence to himself. The materialists say mind arises from elements meeting—heat and moisture producing consciousness like maggots from rotting flesh. This hermit sometimes still feels that way—just chemistry, just biology, just random processes with no deeper meaning.

[1949-1965]
But even that feeling is just another view! The nihilist thinks nothing continues, but this "nothing" is itself a something held in mind. Like a man who says "I have no thoughts"—he has at least that one thought. The trap of views is subtle. Every position is a prison.

[1966-1985]
Longchenpa lists hundreds of wrong views, and this practitioner warns: beware of the nihilistic trap! Some say cause is severed—mind cannot be held as entity. Some say effect is severed—life-force and lordship nonexistent. Some say path is severed—withered, nothing exists. Some say primordial wisdom is severed—Buddha nonexistent. Each severing cuts the one who holds the knife.

[1986-2005]
But do not get lost in the catalog. The point is simple: any view grasping at permanence or interruption, establishing something as truly existent or truly non-existent, is a deviation. The only correct view is the view transcending all views—not by negating them, but by seeing through the one who holds them. Like waking from a dream, one doesn't negate the dream; one sees it was never real.

[2006-2035]
This old practitioner is not a Samkhya, not a Lokayata, not a Buddhist or non-Buddhist. These are clothes to try on. What remains when all costumes are removed? That is what must be discovered. The naked awareness wearing no doctrine, holding no position, free from the illness of philosophical speculation.

[2036-2055]
Kani and jealousy, Bhasira and Kabisha, Sindhara and Dhasim—these are not just ancient Indians! They are this hermit's own mind tendencies. When jealousy arises, he is Kani. When grasping at philosophical positions, he is Bhasira. When thinking meaning is utterly nonexistent, he is Sindhara. The demons are within, wearing modern faces.

[2056-2080]
And the sixty branches, the hundred teachers—Jyotiska, the grasper of the nonexistent, Life, the leaf-possessor, Vishnu, and all the rest—each represents a way the conceptual mind tries to capture reality. And each fails! Not because reality is beyond capture, but because there is nothing to capture. The net is cast into empty water. The hunter pursues his own shadow.

[2081-2100]
Some speak of permanence. Some speak of impermanence. Some speak of both. From these, views multiply endlessly. For every assertion, a negation. For every philosophy, a counter-philosophy. This is the nature of conceptual mind—it divides, opposes, debates endlessly. Like children arguing whether the sky is up or down, both miss the obvious.

[2101-2130]
The tirthikas of various wrongnesses—the sheer number should overwhelm! Moon-dawners, sun-dawners, hand-eaters, heart-livers, possessors of three aggregates—each name represents a whole philosophy, a complete worldview, held sincerely by beings who believe it leads to liberation. This hermit was once a moon-dawner, waking before dawn to practice, thinking the early hour itself was the path.

[2131-2160]
And the seventy, eighty, ninety—owls, forest dwellers, dog-possessors, dwellers on riverbanks—on and on it goes. For every way of thinking, a school. For every limitation, a doctrine turning that limitation into the path. This old practitioner sees himself in all of them. The impulse to make a method, a system, a teaching out of whatever condition one finds oneself in.
