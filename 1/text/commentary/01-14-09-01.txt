Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals lamp characteristics. First characteristic two: general characteristic—wisdom self-appearance show, luminosity mother-child spread, samsara-nirvana two's boundary divide. From Thalgyur: lamp characteristic thus—general appearance show, wisdom mother-child connect, samsara-nirvana two's boundary join. Self-resonance clear light body, conception-free wisdom gather, conception-possess object appearance, non-think wisdom basis not grasp.

[19657-19675]
This old practitioner once misunderstood the lamps as external lights. He sought them in butter lamps, sun, moon—until his teacher laughed. "The lamp is wisdom's own light showing itself. It is not external, not internal, not both. It is the knowing that knows itself."

[19669-19682]
Voice 20 proclaims: Particular characteristic four: first, far-rope—element four's essence gathered, object aspect two's part grasp, appearance spread door become. From Thalgyur: far-rope lamp characteristic—pervade therefore enter, enter therefore pervade, element four self doer abide, grasp enter spread and doer.

[19676-19695]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Wisdom self-arisen characteristic—outer resonance inner arise, intellect realize, dharma-nature pure intention abide, samsara-nirvana turn. From that: wisdom pure characteristic—clear word enter basis gather, affliction karma latency burn, ripen do samsara-nirvana life cut.

[19685-19715]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Basis appearance sense-power arise, circumstance body wisdom, final primordially pure dimension connection, fruit ripen. Wisdom lamp great—basis itself fruit ripen do wisdom. Essence dharma-body that, know body ripen, wisdom dharma-body ripen, that wisdom continuum not cease, body wisdom spontaneous clear.

[19700-19730]
This old hermit found an old lamp in a cave. The flame flickered, yet the oil remained. The lamp is like wisdom—it appears to flicker through conditions, yet its nature is unchanging. The flame is not separate from the oil, yet they are not the same. This is the great paradox of the lamp.

[19715-19745]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Bindu lamp characteristic—round firm red clear eye appear, wisdom arise support do. From previous: bindu empty characteristic—round nature all clear, red clear color clear light, elaboration with spread. Dimension lamp characteristic—blue pervade great light spread, aspect five eye corner two self-clear arise, body arise-basis do.

[19740-19770]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The lamp shows the way, yet is not the way. It illuminates the path, yet is not the destination. Like a guide who points to the mountain—do not mistake the pointing finger for the mountain itself.

[19760-19790]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. From Thalgyur: dimension pure characteristic—blue self-perfect two's aspect, method wisdom perfect, corner two part body two grasp, very appear spread. These all self-know perfect, pervade lord bodhisattva form show, chain rope stretch draw, mandala perfect form like, wisdom all basis luminosity show, light depth resonance brilliance show, body bindu meeting place.

[19780-19810]
This old practitioner once asked, "Which lamp is most important?" His teacher replied, "The lamp that is lit." All five lamps are equal—none superior, none inferior. The practitioner who favors one over another has missed the point. All are wisdom's display.

[19800-19830]
Voice 20 proclaims: Thus wisdom perfect body, this who see Buddha. Don't cling to lamp appearances! They are guides, not goals. Like a raft to cross a river—once crossed, you need not carry the raft. The lamps show the nature; they are not the nature itself.

[19820-19850]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The five lamps are five aspects of one wisdom. To focus on one is to miss the whole. To grasp at their forms is to lose their meaning. Rest in the recognition that all are self-arisen, self-clear, spontaneously present.

[19840-19870]
This old hermit offers final teaching: The lamps appear to those who practice, yet their nature is always present. Like stars hidden by clouds—the stars are not absent; the clouds obscure. When practice clears the clouds, stars appear naturally. They were never created by the clearing.

[19860-19880]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who make the lamps into objects of meditation! They turn wisdom into technique. The lamps are not something to focus on; they are the nature of focus itself. Don't look at the lamps. Be the looking.

[19870-19890]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The five lamps are five aspects of one light. Not to be cultivated separately. Not to be merged artificially. They are naturally one, naturally five. This is the paradox of wisdom—distinct yet unified, manifold yet singular.
