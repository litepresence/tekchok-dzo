Voice 20 proclaims: Particular characteristic four: first, far-rope—element four's essence gathered, object aspect two's part grasp, appearance spread door become. From Thalgyur: far-rope lamp characteristic—pervade therefore enter, enter therefore pervade, element four self doer abide, grasp enter spread and doer.

This old hermit found an old lamp in a cave. The flame flickered, yet the oil remained. The lamp is like wisdom—it appears to flicker through conditions, yet its nature is unchanging. The flame is not separate from the oil, yet they are not the same. This is the great paradox of the lamp.

[19715-19745]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Bindu lamp characteristic—round firm red clear eye appear, wisdom arise support do. From previous: bindu empty characteristic—round nature all clear, red clear color clear light, elaboration with spread. Dimension lamp characteristic—blue pervade great light spread, aspect five eye corner two self-clear arise, body arise-basis do.

Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The lamp shows the way, yet is not the way. It illuminates the path, yet is not the destination. Like a guide who points to the mountain—do not mistake the pointing finger for the mountain itself.

Voice 20 proclaims: Thus wisdom perfect body, this who see Buddha. Don't cling to lamp appearances! They are guides, not goals. Like a raft to cross a river—once crossed, you need not carry the raft. The lamps show the nature; they are not the nature itself.

[19820-19850]
Accordingly. The analysis...

This old hermit offers final teaching: The lamps appear to those who practice, yet their nature is always present. Like stars hidden by clouds—the stars are not absent; the clouds obscure. When practice clears the clouds, stars appear naturally. They were never created by the clearing.

[19860-19880]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who make the lamps into objects of meditation! They turn wisdom into technique. The lamps are not something to focus on; they are the nature of focus itself. Don't look at the lamps. Be the looking.

[19870-19890]
In this manner...
