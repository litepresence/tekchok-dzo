See directly: The framework reveals. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[19657-19675]
This hermit realized: A wandering fool. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[19669-19682]
Voice 20 proclaims: Particular characteristic four: first, far-rope—element four's essence gathered, object aspect two's part grasp, appearance spread door become. From Thalgyur: far-rope lamp characteristic—pervade therefore enter, enter therefore pervade, element four self doer abide, grasp enter spread and doer.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[19676-19695]
Cut through now! Recognition is immediate. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[19685-19715]
Look now: Analysis proceeds. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[19700-19730]
This old hermit found an old lamp in a cave. The flame flickered, yet the oil remained. The lamp is like wisdom—it appears to flicker through conditions, yet its nature is unchanging.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The flame is not separate from the oil, yet they are not the same. This is the great paradox of the lamp.

[19715-19745]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Bindu lamp characteristic—round firm red clear eye appear, wisdom arise support do. From previous: bindu empty characteristic—round nature all clear, red clear color clear light, elaboration with spread. Dimension lamp characteristic—blue pervade great light spread, aspect five eye corner two self-clear arise, body arise-basis do.

[19740-19770]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The lamp shows the way, yet is not the way. It illuminates the path, yet is not the destination. Like a guide who points to the mountain—do not mistake the pointing finger for the mountain itself.

[19760-19790]
Sudden recognition! Thus. We proceed. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[19780-19810]
Thus established: This mountain hermit. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[19800-19830]
Voice 20 proclaims: Thus wisdom perfect body, this who see Buddha. Don't cling to lamp appearances! They are guides, not goals. Like a raft to cross a river—once crossed, you need not carry the raft. The lamps show the nature (rang bzhin); they are not the nature (rang bzhin) itself.

[19820-19850]
Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[19840-19870]
This old hermit offers final teaching: The lamps appear to those who practice, yet their nature is always present. Like stars hidden by clouds—the stars are not absent; the clouds obscure. When practice clears the clouds, stars appear naturally. They were never created by the clearing.

[19860-19880]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who make the lamps into objects of meditation! They turn wisdom into technique. The lamps are not something to focus on; they are the nature (rang bzhin) of focus itself. Don't look at the lamps. Be the looking.

[19870-19890]
This very moment— In this manner.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
