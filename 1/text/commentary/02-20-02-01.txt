First also general placement method and particular extraction method two: This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

From Self-Arising: "Dharmata self-appearance sky, rigpa wisdom unmoved, non-grasping manner placed becomes, wisdom pure self-appearance seen, ignorance deluded appearance dharmas reverse."

"Unsetting victory banner, unchanging lamp clear, thought-free wisdom, clear-dark five lights clear."

"Jewel nectar, doing and meditating not obtained. Lamp expanse appearance, unmoved clear non-grasping examine. Thus from meaning unmoved, jewel nectar lamp. Without abandoning-placing obtaining supreme, without grasping self-place liberated."

[8853-8869]
Second: from Tal 'Gyur: "Body key by dawning, wisdom abiding posture by, thigle gathering swirling accomplishes, light extending gathering. Related binding wind key, entering action extreme distinguishes. That changing action wind exhausted, delusion's arrangement fitted. Rigpa key releasing and, gathering sky placing. Expanse key gathering and, drawing element's wide spread fitting. Appearance key increase and exhaust, various self-place liberated."

Emaho! Keys for binding the elements!

[8880-8884]
Here lies the method of thod rgal, the path of lamps and light. You gaze upon the bindus of light that arise from the vajra-strings of your own awareness—like a bird swiftly taking wing, they appear in an instant. Do you see? This very self-display is your own rigpa's play.

[8885-8890]
If you strike these displays with recognition, they dissolve like deer swift to flee. Rest undistracted upon their meaning, and they circle like bees to nectar. When you truly look at your own display, it stands like a mirage—flickering, yet without substance.

[8891-8898]
Do not be distracted by their outer form, and they become but tremors and flickers. Deeper still, undistracted from their meaning, they become like coals half-concealed—neither fully seen nor extinguished. Thus, if you gaze intensely, you perceive neither coming nor going, only light displaying itself.

[8899-8906]
When you stabilize upon this meaning, you see the lamp of empty bindus. Looking directly at these, you perceive bindus with bodies. Undistracted from their meaning, deluded displays resolve into sambhogakaya forms. All these bodily displays are but illusion, rainbow, and magical display.

[8907-8924]
Resting intensely upon them, day and night become one—like the eyes of a fox, seeing equally in darkness and light. Thus is your own mandala-display. Yet know this: these empty-form rainbow lights and bindus do not exist in the external space, though fools believe they do. They arise from within your body's pure light-channels, seen inwardly through the eye's pure light-channel. The heart's radiance spreads everywhere—now is the time when the base-display dawns. Knowing your own face, rest naturally in your own radiance, and through this you will see what lhun grub luminosity truly is.

Emaho!

Listen here, dear yogin! Within self-reverse from obscuration without—here tantra and instruction say outer sky exists. Intentional condition: outer sky to eye place see portion exists. Nature outer exists, other-by also see possible, yet outer without know! Other-by self empty-form not-see, that body-by obscure. Self-by see light-root pure gap-from within arise, like sun arise appear see from hole-within!

Proof: eye close-from empty-form see—this-by within-in exist indeed! Therefore body etc. appear outer field-in without also exist like appear. Mirror-to look time face arise like: within light-root clear mirror-in, heart awareness face-like resonance appear that. Field-in without also within see, reference pure light-root quality portion-from arise. Outer inner two portion mix appear only—delusion many all true!

Manner thus understand: person wisdom-possess great-perfection expanse-from arise called, various self-free yogin I like! Manner this confident scripture join: Lion Power-Perfect great tantra-from—body appear that all, field appear not indeed! Example young girl-by mirror characteristic clear-to, self face appear see like!

Dharma-nature field sky-to, awareness appear body-to arise! Self location-condition see indeed, field-in exist not indeed! Reference pure manifest clear, self center-and mandala with, wisdom meaning-to field without, sentient-being time-at field like appear! See field-to realize great, understand field-in bliss great, appear see experience great! Self-awareness one-only companion supreme, appear field-in without by!

Emaho! Self-awareness without outer field!

[8960-8969]
Listen, practitioner! Vajra nadi-thread itself-from portion body indeed think-not pervade—thus! This understand-reason one exist, intelligence-possess all-by know must. Nature realize easy by body-appear say, contradiction without explain must. Outer sky-to space-awareness-and lamp-appear say, confuse-possess all-to realize easy for! Self within understand-reason former like indeed!
