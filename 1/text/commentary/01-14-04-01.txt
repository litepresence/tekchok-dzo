Voice 20 proclaims: Divisions: basis-abide wisdom, characteristic-grasp wisdom, object-pervade wisdom—three. From Pearl Garland: wisdom itself thus: basis-abide pure wisdom, characteristic-grasp, object-pervade. First, basis-abide wisdom three: essence primordially pure wisdom, nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom, compassion all-pervade wisdom.

[18295-18313]
In this manner...

[18306-18322]
This old hermit sat in meditation for years trying to achieve wisdom. Then he laughed—wisdom cannot be achieved! It is already the case. Like a man searching for his own head with a lamp, wisdom searches for itself through practice. Put down the lamp; the head is already present.

[18313-18325]
Recognize immediately.

[18314-18332]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom—primordially qualities complete, as power and arise-basis accomplished, wish-fulfilling jewel like appearing, though essence thing and mark empty. From that: nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom called, not-born not-ceased what not think, object pure definite nonexistent, power and quality cease nonexistent, play only appear from, various complete basis-not.

[18321-18340]
Between appearance and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. Not-existing therefore appear, appear therefore empty. Appearance-emptiness entering possessing-aspect. This is the great spontaneous presence—not created, not fabricated, naturally perfect. Like the sun radiating light without effort.

[18322-18345]
Hence. The structure...

[18336-18360]
From Mirror Primordial Wisdom: form-reflection like, shape color appearance complete. White stain pure light, self-possessed appearance samsara-nirvana connect, dharmas form appearance, self-aware primordial wisdom. Clear empty, empty liberated, liberation grasp extreme thought exhausted, placed-not liberation-ground complete.

[18360-18385]
Equality called: equal cause two aspects, equal condition three times, equal hearing time measure, this two without category free. Equal called dharma-nature: pain elaboration completely free, itself called correction effort without, nature abiding essence empty, mind itself thought all exhausted. Wisdom called abiding: that characteristic realized, samsara-nirvana two not abiding.

[18370-18395]
Voice 20 proclaims: Individual analysis power type—whatever to whatever appearance that dharma, order individual clear. Analyzed self-appearance pure, awareness object becomes. Individual called distinction: antidote manner arising path, realization called characteristic seeing complete, self-appearance increase with growth, itself called first arising, knowing wisdom affliction fault pure.

[18384-18410]
Consequently...

[18403-18428]
This old hermit offers final teaching on wisdom: Wisdom is not something to obtain. It is the recognizing of what has always been. Like a man who dreams he is poor, then wakes to find he is wealthy—he didn't become rich; he only recognized what was always true. Wisdom is the waking from the dream of delusion.
