See directly: Accordingly. The analysis. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[18280-18293]
This hermit realized: A simple monk. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[18286-18293]
Voice 20 proclaims: Divisions: basis-abide wisdom, characteristic-grasp wisdom, object-pervade wisdom—three. From Pearl Garland: wisdom itself thus: basis-abide pure wisdom, characteristic-grasp, object-pervade. First, basis-abide wisdom three: essence primordially pure wisdom, nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom, compassion all-pervade wisdom.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[18295-18313]
Cut through now! In this manner. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[18306-18322]
This old hermit sat in meditation for years trying to achieve wisdom. Then he laughed—wisdom cannot be achieved! It is already the case. Like a man searching for his own head with a lamp, wisdom searches for itself through practice. Put down the lamp; the head is already present.

[18313-18325]
The vast middle way: Recognize immediately. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Regarding shes pa: Consciousness grasps; wisdom knows without grasping. The difference is the difference between samsara and nirvana.

[18314-18332]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom—primordially qualities complete, as power and arise-basis accomplished, wish-fulfilling jewel like appearing, though essence thing and mark empty. From that: nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom called, not-born not-ceased what not think, object pure definite nonexistent, power and quality cease nonexistent, play only appear from, various complete basis-not.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[18321-18340]
Between appearance and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. Not-existing therefore appear, appear therefore empty. Appearance-emptiness entering possessing-aspect. This is the great spontaneous presence—not created, not fabricated, naturally perfect. Like the sun radiating light without effort.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[18322-18345]
Sudden recognition! Hence. The structure. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

[18336-18360]
From Mirror Primordial Wisdom: form-reflection like, shape color appearance complete. White stain pure light, self-possessed appearance samsara-nirvana connect, dharmas form appearance, self-aware primordial wisdom. Clear empty, empty liberated, liberation grasp extreme thought exhausted, placed-not liberation-ground complete.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[18346-18370]
Rest in: This old yogi. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[18360-18385]
Equality called: equal cause two aspects, equal condition three times, equal hearing time measure, this two without category free. Equal called dharma-nature: pain elaboration completely free, itself called correction effort without, nature abiding essence empty, mind itself thought all exhausted. Wisdom called abiding: that characteristic realized, samsara-nirvana two not abiding.

[18370-18395]
Voice 20 proclaims: Individual analysis power type—whatever to whatever appearance that dharma, order individual clear. Analyzed self-appearance pure, awareness object becomes. Individual called distinction: antidote manner arising path, realization called characteristic seeing complete, self-appearance increase with growth, itself called first arising, knowing wisdom affliction fault pure.

[18384-18410]
In the secret mandala: Consequently. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[18403-18428]
This old hermit offers final teaching on wisdom: Wisdom is not something to obtain. It is the recognizing of what has always been. Like a man who dreams he is poor, then wakes to find he is wealthy—he didn't become rich; he only recognized what was always true. Wisdom is the waking from the dream of delusion.
