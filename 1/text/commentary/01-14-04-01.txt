[18274-18285]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals wisdom nature. First, wisdom essence: self-awareness primordially abiding as knowledge, primordially knowing. From that: wisdom called abiding from that, that characteristic realized, samsara-nirvana two not abiding. Definitive meaning: primordially abiding meaning realized and known. From Self-Arisen: primordially nature spontaneously accomplished, then realization face-to-face becomes. Wisdom definitive meaning thus.

[18280-18293]
This old practitioner sought wisdom in scriptures, retreat, and meditation. Then one morning, while drinking tea, he realized wisdom was never separate from the knowing itself. The tea was tasted, the taste was known—this knowing is wisdom. No need to seek what has never been absent.

[18286-18293]
Voice 20 proclaims: Divisions: basis-abide wisdom, characteristic-grasp wisdom, object-pervade wisdom—three. From Pearl Garland: wisdom itself thus: basis-abide pure wisdom, characteristic-grasp, object-pervade. First, basis-abide wisdom three: essence primordially pure wisdom, nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom, compassion all-pervade wisdom.

[18295-18313]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Essence primordially pure wisdom—beyond existence-non-existence extremes, like sky. From Thalgyur: essence primordially pure wisdom, non-awareness called existence-name nonexistent, one and two number nonexistent, analyzed exist-non-exist established nonexistent, wherever not-divided dharma-nature from, wisdom merely also accomplished nonexistent, word-free expression accomplished nonexistent, extreme not-abide self-aware pure, expression-grasp name limit exhausted.

[18306-18322]
This old hermit sat in meditation for years trying to achieve wisdom. Then he laughed—wisdom cannot be achieved! It is already the case. Like a man searching for his own head with a lamp, wisdom searches for itself through practice. Put down the lamp; the head is already present.

[18313-18325]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Cause nonexistent, condition number nonexistent, two-appearance object-subject nonexistent, characteristic wherever divided nonexistent, object-condition coarse self-exhausted. Primordially not-existing, pure, pure. Delusion-realization ceases—what not done? Not-born, therefore cease-empty.

[18314-18332]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom—primordially qualities complete, as power and arise-basis accomplished, wish-fulfilling jewel like appearing, though essence thing and mark empty. From that: nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom called, not-born not-ceased what not think, object pure definite nonexistent, power and quality cease nonexistent, play only appear from, various complete basis-not.

[18321-18340]
Between appearance and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. Not-existing therefore appear, appear therefore empty. Appearance-emptiness entering possessing-aspect. This is the great spontaneous presence—not created, not fabricated, naturally perfect. Like the sun radiating light without effort.

[18322-18345]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. Compassion all-pervade wisdom—not deliberate activity various arise door, deed appear entity complete, Dharmakaya empty nature, wisdom knowing complete aspect, force compassion beings arise, not samsara-nirvana class broken, knowing aware clear. Self-aware clear identity—nature force compassion, not-ceased ceased not.

[18336-18360]
From Mirror Primordial Wisdom: form-reflection like, shape color appearance complete. White stain pure light, self-possessed appearance samsara-nirvana connect, dharmas form appearance, self-aware primordial wisdom. Clear empty, empty liberated, liberation grasp extreme thought exhausted, placed-not liberation-ground complete.

[18346-18370]
This old practitioner watched a river flow. The water is wisdom—clear, moving, unobstructed. The forms reflected are appearances—empty, unreal, yet vivid. The river doesn't try to reflect; it naturally does. Wisdom doesn't try to know; it naturally is. This is the great ease of Dzogchen.

[18360-18385]
Equality called: equal cause two aspects, equal condition three times, equal hearing time measure, this two without category free. Equal called dharma-nature: pain elaboration completely free, itself called correction effort without, nature abiding essence empty, mind itself thought all exhausted. Wisdom called abiding: that characteristic realized, samsara-nirvana two not abiding.

[18370-18395]
Voice 20 proclaims: Individual analysis power type—whatever to whatever appearance that dharma, order individual clear. Analyzed self-appearance pure, awareness object becomes. Individual called distinction: antidote manner arising path, realization called characteristic seeing complete, self-appearance increase with growth, itself called first arising, knowing wisdom affliction fault pure.

[18384-18410]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Action accomplished called complete—not effort striving, self-cease, dharmas all self-place self-liberated. Self-liberation complete basis-appearance: aspect subtle dust-free stain-free obtained, analysis object beyond, wherever not-divided dharma-nature, nature complete appearance limit exhausted, simultaneously realized, desire-free accomplishment, no repetition no reversion, itself abiding meaning, knowing face-to-face, dharmas exhausted place arrived.

[18403-18428]
This old hermit offers final teaching on wisdom: Wisdom is not something to obtain. It is the recognizing of what has always been. Like a man who dreams he is poor, then wakes to find he is wealthy—he didn't become rich; he only recognized what was always true. Wisdom is the waking from the dream of delusion.
