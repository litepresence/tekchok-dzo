You hear "base" and you think it is a thing, a foundation, something solid to stand on. Foolish! The base is the actual state—primordially pure, not falling in any direction, not cut by any boundary. India is just a name. Direction is just a concept. The base does not fall anywhere because it is everywhere.

The jewel casket of spontaneous presence—below it, forms arise in six manners, gates exist in two forms. Called spontaneous presence, called not-certain, called various arising. Below that, reverse ground exists. Below that, base appearance great is called. Below that, enjoyment body appearance exists. You think these are levels, stages, something to climb. They are not. They are descriptions of how the base appears—not certain, various, spontaneously present. Like the ocean that can be calm or wavy, yet remains ocean.

Inside the expanse, the youth vase body—essence abides as body, nature as speech, compassion as mind. Life-wind, four limbs, five wisdom winds—essence awareness abides, resonance appears outside. The youth vase body, limitless, not separate—from spontaneous presence resonance, five lights appear, flames arise together. Compassion-awareness resonance form investigates, knowledge arises. Self-face not-knowing—just part from awareness, ignorance is called and abides. The base does not change, yet base-appearances arise, change, become similar. Awareness-appearance is called change. At that time, from the primordially pure appearance like sky without clouds, spontaneous presence arises in eight manners, self-appearance arises. The jewel casket actual-state great appearance. Compassion arises like compassion—not ceasing understanding, sentient being compassion arises. Light arises like light—not ceasing understanding, five wisdoms' self-light rainbow-like pervades. Wisdom arises like wisdom—not ceasing understanding, not-thinking state abides. Body arises like body—not ceasing understanding, peaceful-wrathful light-clear body pervades the sky. Two not-existing arises like—not ceasing understanding, one and many not investigated.

So the base is not a thing. It is the actual state from which all arises—body, speech, mind, light, wisdom, form. Yet it does not change. Like the sky that remains sky whether clouds come or go. The eight manners of spontaneous presence arise from the cloudless sky of primordially pure appearance. Do you see? Do not investigate one and many. Do not grasp at the arising. Let it be as it is.

Listen here, dear practitioner! For example, clouds in the sky truly do not exist—clouds are adventitious, arisen and passing. Likewise, base, path, and awareness do not truly exist as separate things!

Compassion arises, yet non-recognition also arises. The base is called the state of spontaneous accomplishment—attach to this! That also is not determined; great appearance dwells as one. That also possesses the eight aspects of the arising way, called the state of the jewel casket.

The door of desire-objects does not cease—great establishment dwells as non-establishment. The door of compassion's arising does not cease. The enjoyment of primordial-wisdom's arising does not cease. The essence of form's arising does not cease. The view of non-dual arising is not determined. The method of liberation from limits does not cease. The gate of pure primordial-wisdom is thoroughly reached. The compassion of impure arising does not cease.

Desire-objects are like jewels—attach to form like that! The inner youth vase form is called extent-open. The outer state of spontaneous accomplishment dwells as that. At that time, your appearance spreads outward. Not clear, not unclear; not shattered, not unshattered; not scattered, not unscattered; not distracted, not undistracted—moving, flickering, spreading as variety. Then great attachment to spontaneous accomplishment's state!

[11421-11452]
That primordial-wisdom's door does not cease—complete cause, enjoyment-appearance way attaches. Quality's door does not cease—nature's emanation form. Compassion's door does not cease—impure appearance.

The great dharma of appearance's limit is not thought, not reached. Light-form clear, spontaneously thick, arranged. Samsara-nirvana's gate of arising is vast. All contained in the great cavity!

Emaho! The great cavity of spontaneous accomplishment contains all!

When jealousy arises in your mind, you are in the human realm at that moment. When anger burns, you are in the god realm—or when pride towers, you create a god realm without form. Desire makes you a hungry ghost, delusion makes you an animal, hatred deep and black makes you experience hell. The cyclic existence is not a place. It is the place of your own mind's grasping.

Your own grasping at self and other.

So look at the world around you. Is it solid? Is it real? Or is it the display of five elements, the play of spontaneous presence, the self-appearance of your own awareness? Do not be fooled by the outer container. Look at what contains it.

[11648-11667]
reveal the crucial difference between self-appearance and deluded-appearance!

Self appears to self—this is the natural display! Common world, common karma, teacher's activity arranged. But look! Self-appearance to self, though it seems like delusion, is actually the door of cyclic existence arranged by wisdom itself!

When the bundle of self-appearance transfers, it falls into common other-face—this is the bardo, the between! Now you exist in the common perception of others!

This distinction is most important! Nature awareness self-arises! Spontaneous presence manifests the six realms! Deluded-appearance, dream-like, primordially pure—this ground-appearance does not exist as self reversed! Send yourself back! This is the point!

In the bardo, self-face appears as emanations to benefit the six realms! But there are two aspects: impure cyclic existence not yet manifest—here self-appearance does not benefit because action and object do not appear! Once manifest from—benefit is needed!

If deluded-appearance is not empty, liberation is impossible! This point is subtle, most important!

The eight qualities generally shown, the fault-qualities divided by conditions—these are proof! Arise-cessation, appearance-mode, proof placed!

Like a mirror reflecting a face—the reflection appears but has no substance! Like a dream at night—you experience but nothing truly happens!

Know the difference between wisdom's display and delusion's trap!

Emaho! The subtle distinction between clarity and confusion!

[11682-11686]
Listen! The tamer and what tames—both are your own mind playing. Secret Essence itself is great compassion. Six realms appear yet don't abide. Like clouds in sky—there, but never staying.

[11687-11690]
Look! Light and sound awareness-base appear, yet the five elements have no separate existence. If you say they don't exist, awareness is not cut off inside. If you say the container-contents don't arise—you miss the point entirely.

[11691-11694]
Three doors of body, speech, mind—three kayas of Buddha gather. No separation! Body appearing like body yet not existing as body—this is the nature. Do you see?

[11695-11698]
Primordial wisdom appears yet is non-existent. If you claim transcendence from samsara joins path-wisdom, you fall into defect. Extremes liberated—appear yet Buddha doesn't return. Non-arising itself is the quality.

[11699-11702]
Impure door appears—yet spontaneous arising doesn't exist there. Beings appear in samsara but awareness-face doesn't come for a purpose. Six realms individually appear—that's the nature.

[11703-11710]
Great power from the base! Even playing in samsara's bad realms is primordial arising. Pure primordial-wisdom door non-existent—nirvana's appearance has no coming. Spontaneous eight appear-methods, eight qualities—suitable to count, suitable to see.

Eight doors of appearance-making—eight qualities arise as method. Six families escape the cave of self-cut. Samsara's swing-rope cut by those who grasp compassion's lasso.

So look at the sun. Its rays do not go anywhere else. They dissolve into the sun itself. Look at the mirror. Its appearances do not go anywhere. They are already nirvana. Look at the rainbow in the sky. It does not go somewhere else when it fades. It dissolves into the sky itself. Look at the child entering the mother's lap. It does not travel far. It returns to the source. Your own primordial awareness—confident, self-nature nirvana. The kayas dissolve into themselves. Form is not-thought in the great. Appearance is nirvana without existing as appearance. Action does not exist as nirvana. Everything self-dissolves, self-pure, self-complete. What is left for you to do? Only recognize. Only rest.

reveal the instant liberation—the path of no path!

Base appears—see it and instantly liberate! Liberate and abide in space! From this, benefit others! This is the method!

How? From primordial space, inner tone outward arises! Compassion-awareness, self-non-awareness aspect, merely arises! That base-appear outward looks! Self-appear self-is-know—inward realize, and instantly!

Non-awareness self-pure! Base-appear spontaneous appears! Self-dissolve pure! Ground self-place abides!

Instant in Buddha! Before coming teacher! Resultant-reversal! Samsara-nirvana primordial final! Buddha does not become through delusion!

Base transcended sense! Self-appear nature non-existent! Know this! Thought-investigate mind plural—outward not lose! Move self-rope decide!

Like a bird freed from a cage—no need to learn flying! Like ice melting into water—no need to destroy the ice!

The instant you see, you are liberated! Not gradually, not through stages, not through effort! Simply see the nature of what appears!

Do not look for buddha outside! Do not wait for realization in the future! It is here, now, in this very instant!

Like lightning flashing—if you blink, you miss it! Like an echo in the valley—hear it now or it is gone!

Emaho! The instant that contains all time!

[12047-12058]
Listen well! The great collection is completely complete. Undefined non-awareness dawn is obscuration defeated from primordial time. Know in self-appearance the non-awareness dawn. That dawn—all afflictions dawn. Non-awareness dawn from which arise—for that merely self-abiding quality manifests, becomes body-primordial-wisdom-Buddha.

Roughly said: liberated from first base. Liberated when base-from-base-appearance arises. Liberated in an instant transcending the base. Where liberated? Roughly said: the base is first liberated. Liberated in the spontaneous ground of complete-end!

[12059-12071]
If base-first liberated, also return become. From the place where the base's suitable aspect of delusion arises—for samsara-nirvana is the base. Say self-primordial as liberation-place. Query: is base primordial? Although primordial is explained in the nature, first base is non-is. Briefly: when self-face is known, space-quality is complete-end. Say result is liberated from obscuration-free. Therefore, when body-primordial-wisdom etc. quality arise-base abides, say space-quality!

[12072-12086]

Or base-spontaneous Buddha-quality. Say accept: result manifest-become accomplish Buddha-quality. Thus Samantabhadra Buddha that also! Dharma six. Transcend from base. Appear in self-face. Divide distinction. Liberate first distinguish. Non-arise from other. Abide in self-place. That plural cause from non-arise result. Buddha from mind non-arise. Buddha from self-arise instruction non-arise scripture. Liberate base-appear result from primordial base!

Emaho! Liberation is primordial!

That time know: object-field appear-arise aspect, self-face realize aspect—all realize Buddha is! From self-face inner-abiding nature state, investigate do—elaboration ceases, all realize Buddha. That also: although all know, self-face nature non-moves. Inner abide know. In outward gaze know aspect. Distinction: aspect appear non-appear. All realize primordial-wisdom. Say: aspect all realize primordial-wisdom. Aspect all realize primordial-wisdom. That two reverse—different nature, one inner abide, all realize is!

, these all common vehicles in also appear. Uttaratantra from: Compounded-not and spontaneously accomplished, other condition realized not and, knowing and compassion and power possessing, benefit-two possessing buddha nature, beginning middle end none of, nature being reason compounded-not, peaceful dharmakaya possessing reason, spontaneously accomplished called expressed, self self realize for-reason, other condition realize not, thus manner three realize for-reason knowing, path show for-reason mind compassionate, power pristine-awareness compassion, suffering afflictions dispel for-reason, first three self-benefit, later three other-benefit is, says and. These all appear in common vehicles too. From the Uttaratantra: Not compounded and spontaneously accomplished. Other condition, realized not. Knowing, compassion, power possessing. Benefit-two possessing Buddha nature. Beginning, middle, end none. Nature being reason—not compounded. Peaceful dharmakaya possessing reason. Spontaneously accomplished called, expressed. Self self realize—for reason. Other condition realize not. Thus manner three realize—for reason knowing. Path show—for reason mind compassionate. Power pristine-awareness compassion. Suffering afflictions dispel—for reason. First three self-benefit. Later three other-benefit. Says and.

So you see? The Buddha nature is not something you must create. It is not compounded. It is spontaneously accomplished. It possesses knowing, compassion, power. It has the two benefits—self and other. It has no beginning, middle, or end. It is the peaceful dharmakaya. And why does the compassionate mind show the path? Why does pristine awareness use power and compassion to dispel suffering? For reason. For the reason of benefiting self and other.

The jewels are your own nature. The stupa is your body. The path is untraversable because you are already there. Do not look for the mandala outside. Do not look for the jewel in another's pocket. Everything Longchenpa describes is your own mind, your own awareness, your own spontaneously present nature. Recognize this, and you are the wealthiest being in all existence.

Thinking thus, consciousness arises only! Deluded! Ignorance—that basis possesses neither experience nor appearance! Appearance from conditions—four appearances arise!

That itself from—thus world three itself. Aggregates five, faculties five, limbs five, essences five, objects five, afflictions five, minds five, mentals five, thoughts five. Grasped-grasper samsara accomplished. Says and.

So you see? The wheel of dependent origination is not ultimate truth. It is the deluded appearance. When you die, when the breath is cut, you enter the interval—the bardo. There, dependent origination can reverse. The coarse and subtle dissolve. The channels transfer. And from deluded-appearance empty, samsara turns. How? Nirvana self-arisen—primordially pure appearance arises first. The dharmata bardo appearances are nirvana's dependent origination manifest. If you do not know your own face there, you wander. If you know, you liberate. It is called liberation from samsara-nirvana-samsara.

But understand—the base and base-appearance, both have no ignorance. They are cloud-like, adventitious, condition-made. The impure samsara appears like a doorway, cause-made. But delusion from the start? None. The dharmakaya is like the sky. Beings, like clouds, obscure it adventitiously. The base-appearance itself—ignorance is just a label. Delusion is not accomplished. It does not exist. All these—worlds, aggregates, faculties, limbs, essences, objects, afflictions, minds, mentals, thoughts—grasped and grasper, they accomplish samsara. But they are like clouds. The sky remains pure.

So do not fear the twelve links. Do not fear death. In the bardo, the dharmata appears. Know your own face, and you are liberated. Do not know, and you wander. But even wandering is not other than the display of your own base. The clouds are not other than the sky. The waves are not other than the ocean. Rest in that recognition, and the wheel turns itself to liberation.

Listen! Thus cyclic existence name arises. Inconceivable forms beings arise. Delusion's path thought conceived arise thus said. Therein Vajrasattva Rigpa Awareness Itself. Broad Expanse field display—Primordial Four. Beautiful Abode gateway basis-appearances spontaneously arise!

Time dissolves self non-recognition—other deluded basis-display. Year Pig time ignorance fully conceptualized. Emanated Sun clear thought-grasping coarse appearances. Star Bird attachment objects arisen desire. Elder Crone non-recognition consciousness deluded grasping. Indeterminate lineage basis-appearance wherever arising liberating—common ground delusion liberation.

reveal the six ignorances that bind you!

Vow-breaking actions many done! Mind definitely placed! All these by-means-of appearance to "I"-by-means-of be! Other-by-means-of be think! Definitely place mind!

This grasping thought is ignorance itself! Remedy path-by-means-of ignorance? No! Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure! Mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see! Clear not give!

Wisdom to thought not-possess! Mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause! Buddha-by-means-of path obscure! Artificial path-by-means-of ignorance called!

Not-know confuse-by-means-of ignorance! Self-by-means-of appearance-by-means-of light-in exist not-know! Again again samsara cause! Samsara-in samsara!

Thus ignorance six-as arise-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of appearance not-know! Ignorance sentient-being-by-means-of delusion manner!

First spontaneous from self arise! Self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from! End delusion cease time later not-pure! Lineage cut! Stain what be! Samsara first-last! Buddha last not-possess!

Like a man lost in a dream—searching for the dreamer who is himself! Like a mirror seeking its own reflection—it already shows everything!

You wander endlessly, creating the prison of "I" and "mine"! The remedy is not another path! The remedy is recognizing the path-maker is the path itself!

Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury—from this wisdom appears!

Emaho! The ignorance that wisdom itself reveals!

That mind grasps delusion-appearance. That many afflictions arise—hosts armies! Delusion primordial purity without samsara-basis incompleteness arisen. Second practice lineage indicates delusion liberation—two revealed.
