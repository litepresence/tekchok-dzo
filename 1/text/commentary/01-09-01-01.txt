[11335-11337] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between the arising of awareness and the ground of being, the nature of primordial purity abides like space itself. The teachings speak of a state untouched by the limitations of geography or direction—a primordial expanse where all phenomena naturally rest without falling into any extreme. This is the beginningless ground from which all manifestation emerges.

[11338-11344] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The framework establishes three fundamental designations: spontaneous presence as the ground, indeterminacy as its essential quality, and diversity as its natural expression. Precise analysis reveals these as the foundational categories for understanding how the ground manifests.

[11345-11354] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): From the youthful vase body within the primordial expanse, essence abides as form, nature as speech, compassion as mind. Like fiery sparks arising from the tones of spontaneous presence, the investigating consciousness emerges—yet not knowing its own face, it becomes the condition for non-recognition. This is the moment of forgetting, like a dreamer who does not know they dream.

[11355-11369] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner sees how the ground itself never changes, yet appearances seem to transform. Like clouds forming in a cloudless sky, the eight modes of spontaneous presence arise from primordial purity. The gates open unobstructed: compassion gives rise to compassion for beings, light fills appearances with rainbow radiance, wisdom abides in non-conceptuality, and form manifests as peaceful and wrathful deities. All these arise without obstruction.

[11370-11386] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Stop. Recognize. The appearances of the five wisdoms, the self-light of the Buddha fields, all arise directly as self-clear manifestation. Though appearing, they are like reflections in a mirror—appearing to oneself, not to others, like dream appearances that flicker and fade. Not grasping its own face, the recognition lasts only an instant.

[11387-11420] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between the ground and its appearance, the precious casket of spontaneous presence holds all possibilities. From the tantras we learn: though there is no error, from the power of compassion error arises. The unchanging ground appears without ceasing, and from this indeterminacy, non-recognition self-arises. Like clouds that do not truly exist in the sky but appear adventitiously, so delusion arises while the ground remains pure.

[11421-11450] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): CUT THROUGH NOW! The eight gates of appearance are unobstructed—compassion appearing, light appearing, wisdom appearing, form appearing, non-duality appearing, beyond-extremes appearing, pure wisdom appearing, impure samsara appearing. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, all these abide in the body. The appearance expands outward, undefined and indefinite, moving and shifting, arising diversely.

[11451-11490] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. From the Precious Heap Tantra, we understand the arising of spontaneous presence through eight modes. The manner of appearance, unobstructed, gives rise to the source of protection for all beings. From self-clear unobstructed appearance, the five lights dawn. The Buddha bodies appear as the complete display of dharmas. The essence is one, therefore non-dual. Since it does not abide in its own place, it appears as beyond-extremes.

[11491-11530] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Resting in the spacious nature of spontaneous presence, one finds the great casket that encompasses all. The qualities arise without ceasing—the thirty-two marks, the eighty minor marks, the six broad dharmas. From this appear the natural nirmanakaya fields adorned with immeasurable richness. The manner of appearance is inexhaustible enjoyment, inexhaustible retinue, unknowable qualities and powers.

[11531-11570] Voice 22 (Drolo): Sudden wrath arises! The impure world-system manifests from the five poisons: from jealousy, humans; from hatred, gods; from pride, demigods; from desire, hungry ghosts; from delusion, animals; from anger, hell beings. Thus the six realms are established. Yet know this: they arise from the one great nature appearing in four manners. Samsara and nirvana both emerge from this single ground.

[11571-11610] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner laughs at the irony—all this appearance arises from primordial purity, yet beings do not recognize it as their own display. The common world appears through common karma, arranged by the Teacher's activity. The deluded aspect appears to oneself, arranged by the gate of self-appearance. Distinguishing these two is extremely important, like knowing the difference between a rope and a snake in the twilight.

[11611-11650] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between knowing and not-knowing lies the entire path. Naturally, from the gate of self-arisen spontaneous presence, the appearance of the six migrations exists. The key point is that deluded appearance, dream-like, must be sent to self-reversal in the ground of primordial purity. In the bardo too, whether the manifestations work for benefit depends on recognition. Before impure samsara arises, if one knows self-appearance, there is no benefit to be done—yet once arisen, benefit must be done.

[11651-11690] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The eight aspects of virtue in spontaneous presence establish the philosophical analysis. From the eight gates of appearance come eight virtues. Cutting the escape hole of the six migrations, those who cut the binding rope of samsara appear as great compassion itself. Samsara and nirvana self-related as virtue appear in the manner of mixing two aspects. Without this, there would be no realization.

[11691-11730] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Stop. Recognize. Without the gate of pure wisdom, the appearance of nirvana would have no meaning. Without the impure gate, sentient beings would not appear. Spontaneous presence has gates of seeing whether pure or impure—like windows exist, yet pure and impure do not exist in the ground itself. The eight virtues appear in the eight modes.

[11731-11770] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The division into faults and virtues through conditions reveals the subtle nature of appearance. Like camphor appearing as virtue for hot disease yet fault for cold disease, the ground and its appearance are not established as fault or virtue in themselves. From the aspect of delusion reversal, faults appear as virtue. From the aspect of spontaneous presence power, wisdom appears. Precise analysis establishes these points.

[11771-11810] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): CUT THROUGH NOW! The dissolution manner reveals how all appearances return to the ground. From the Precious Heap Tantra: all these virtue-appearances, rigpa's own virtue, the play power dissolution—eight in number. Spontaneous presence ground without certainty, virtue manner thus thus. Compassion itself to compassion, self-nature self-dissolved, without establishment obtaining manner, passes to actionless expanse.

[11811-11850] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between arising and ceasing, the natural state remains unchanging. Non-acting, nothing at all—all activities nirvana. Unmade action without appearance—all compounded pure expanse. The sun's rays self-dissolve into the sun's heart. All dream-appearances nirvana. The nature utterly pure, marks and attachment objects cease. Though outer elements coarse, here not seen, attachment reverses.

[11851-11890] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Resting in self-pure great emptiness, color self-grasping nirvana. This too not gone elsewhere—self-nature self-dissolved, all appearances nirvana. Light mandala self-dissolved, like sky rainbow self-dissolving in sky itself. In great non-discriminating expanse, all grasping attachments nirvana. Wisdom itself to wisdom, self-nature self-dissolved, awareness grasping thoughts memories self-abiding equality expanse.

[11891-11930] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner sees how all individual wisdom appearance aspects, in the center of unmade expanse, without ceasing nirvana. Self-face not-dissolved is like child entering mother's lap—self-wisdom self-confidence, self-nature nirvana. Body itself body self-dissolved, all forms non-conceptual great, without appearance nirvana. Coarse elements and subtle non-recognition without action nirvana.

[11931-11970] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Non-dual non-dual self-dissolved, number-grasping attachments unique free from elaborations. Two-appearing self-dissolved, like river to river dissolving, not dividing difference, non-divided great nirvana. Beyond-extremes itself to beyond-extremes, self-nature self-dissolved, all body-speech grasping continuums exhausted nirvana. Like sky to sky dissolving, no face grasping, four extreme thought-attachments self-ceased, non-abiding great nirvana.

[11971-12000] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The manner of liberation demonstrates how ground-appearance, whether knowing self-face or not, like crystal light dissolving inward, like former dream ceasing when latter appears—all appearance gone to nothing, from original tone inward reversal, not going elsewhere. This manner is the difficult point of Secret Essence Heart Drop.
