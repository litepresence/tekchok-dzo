[14278-14280]
Emaho!

[14278-14309]
Non-duality dissolving into non-duality is like a river dissolving into a river [14263]. Freedom from extremes dissolving into freedom from extremes is like space dissolving into space [14264]. Pure wisdom gate dissolving into essence original purity is like a lion taking a snow mountain [14265]. Impure samsara gate dissolving into pure wisdom gate is like drawing in a silken cord [14266]. The fifth, extensive explanation of essential instructions that liberate into those, has two: hitting the crucial point with dharmata meaning essential instruction, and focusing with three times essential instruction

[14278-14280]
.

Second: In that nature, without fabrication, naturally in meditation, cut through completely, without distraction, without grasping—this is meditation

[14281-14300]
, bardo's clear light like that carrier, those two bridge-joined; space-awareness carrier similar appearance shown: "Son of family, this present clear light is self-arisen wisdom itself—without modifying mind, rest in this nature; upward zangthal you become Buddha."

Also

[14281-14282]
.

Third: At that time, free of meditation object and subject, rigpa pure from ground shines and liberates, without abandoning good-bad thought collections, self-liberated—confidence and repetition

[14283-14285]
.

Emaho!

[14286-14344]
My devoted students, listen! In natural ground, though various appear, they do not exist as appearance. Gather into one all-knowing pure luminosity, self-clear self-arising wisdom, and meditate with repetition

[14286-14288]
.

That grasping also liberates—nothing else to do. This is the essential instruction of light-appearance liberating into dharmata

[14289-14290]
.

Looking outward, clear inward rigpa, instantaneously naked essence—this is the second crucial great essential instruction

[14291-14295]
.

Compassion's crucial point: Though various external objects to be tamed arise as conditions, and many rigpas to tame appear radiating, do not cut the outward radiating traces, do not examine your own face, do not negate inwardly—whatever arises, leave it in its own place, directly settled, boundless naked clear rigpa, grasping that, seeing liberation place truly

[14296-14302]
.

That very clear free rigpa, without gaps, directly settled, exhausted, pure "ka"—this and bardo awareness arising unceasing are grasped, then ka-pure compassion rigpa is known and liberated

[14301-14320]
: "Look without changing this appearance; present clear light dharmata mother's clear light, all appearances buddha-fields dawning, mixed will become; that time recognize self-appearance; that time ka-dag ground you become Buddha."

There not recognizing

[14303-14304]
. This is the third crucial great essential instruction [14305].

These three are secret heart essence amrita, extremely pure, extremely secret [14306]. Words few but meaning great, sutra-tantra few but crucial great, depth essential but importance great. To heart-sons supreme, not others, seal of essential instruction

[14307-14310]
.

Emaho!

[14317-14328]
.

"Furthermore, dharmata nature explained: Here not one certain, whatever labeled thus appears. From various name bases, words and phrases' elaboration appears. From uncertain various names, meaning also empty of mere labeling. Since emptiness not established anywhere, nature pure thus appears"

[14321-14340]
, clear light lhundrub dissolving time, kaya and wisdom's appearance dawns; then four wisdoms' meeting appearance dawns; then lhundrub's eight doors dawning—you recognize self-appearance; self-recognized immediately ka-dag ground you well-go, three times spoken; oneself also that appearance equally placed, again there clear pointing.

That certainly liberates

[14328-14337]
.

"Furthermore, dharmata compassion explained: Objects to be tamed various, taming forms also that many. From lineage and faculty displays, samsara-nirvana realization different. That itself placed as individual object is uncorrected meaning's intention"

[14338-14344]
.

The second, focusing with three times essential instruction, has two: three times' places and method essential instructions

[14341-14360]
. Sun-Moon Union: "If space-awareness unclear, dharmata bliss bardo, rigpa's appearance grasping, before shown lights mind-do; that obtains true appearance. If those unclear, own guru present, above instruction clearly point; no guru, vajra sibling, awareness's clear pointing do."

Thus instructions pointing

[14345-14379]
You who wish to be free, understand! The three crucial points with citations:

From Talgyur: "Furthermore, dharmata essence: established as essence from nature. Since appearance mode is not one certain, entering paths are also different. With face, knowledge, and liberation seeing, entering, seeing, and habituation. From face recognition, own face. Confident heart is the place. Decided, confidence enters. Thus three's certain activity: essence complete, cause ceases"

[14346-14347]
.

Place crucial points three: entering knowing crucial point, liberation own face crucial point, completion face knowing crucial point

[14348-14350]
.

Emaho!

[14355-14356]
.

Aggregates' self-grasping ceasing, body liberates as clear light, dharmata abides in own face. Elements coarse and subtle particles liberated, appearance abides as clear light great bliss. Afflictions coarse and subtle liberated, rigpa abides as mother and child dissolved

[14357-14359]
.

Outer delusion purified, rigpa knows meeting dharmata mother, and various conditioned appearances as objects liberate from coarse and subtle things, mother and child nondual liberation [14360].

How liberated? Earth element's characteristics self-purified, body's flesh bindings liberated. Water purified, blood; fire purified, warmth; wind purified, breath bindings liberated

[14361-14380]
, prolonged death or dharma-view disharmonious others, death-point with three jewel instructions benefit others shown: breath outer stopped, inner not stopped time, oneself momentary dharmata direct intention placed; then other person's breath separated, gap that mouth-nose three and own mouth-nose three joined.

Emaho!

[14361-14365]
. No thought horse, flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated. Inner rigpa without affliction stains, five wisdoms self-display. Objects' stains without, phenomena and dharmata nondual

[14366-14369]
.

Emaho!

[14370-14334]
.

Third, completion face knowing crucial point: Rigpa reaching spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel's own place, abiding in nondual original purity and spontaneous accomplishment, knowing that

[14380-14405]
Listen, my fortunate ones! The first: When rigpa enters outward clear light appearance, know radiance as self-display [14352]. When light enters inward into rigpa, know not moving from that ground of original purity [14353].

Second: At the time of four wisdoms preparation, outer, inner, and secret three liberations abiding in own face, knowing own face essential instruction—grasping that

[14380-14381]
.

All samsara's phenomena purified at that time, so previous delusion not experienced is decided. Now impossible to delude, obtaining body of no-return, rigpa itself no-return place

[14381-14400]
: outward first dum-bu white om contemplated, thrown; second red ah with thrown; last whatever not contemplated, thrown. Returning three all hum contemplated, that awareness blue hum own rigpa drawn.

Speech also hum

[14382-14384]
.

Samsara's deluded appearance, nirvana's pure appearance, when both dissolve into that dharmadhatu, existence and non-existence, permanence and nihilism not established anywhere, so samsara-nirvana equal, gone to ground liberation—at that time of spontaneous accomplishment dissolving, know thus [14384].

This is rigpa own face's great crucial point [14385].

Second, method essential instruction has two: previous essential instruction and this time's sharp-dull difference

[14386-14387]
.

Emaho!

[14401-14420]
reciting, drawn to gap under foot, strongly drawn. That time own body-speech-mind three strengthened, drawn inside gap, his wind warm completely inside comes out—certain.

That time other person's eyes hri-gi comes

[14406-14441]
My heart-sons and daughters, understand! Thus abiding in own face, knowing thus, afflictions cannot arise in rigpa. Liberated from samsara's karmic ripening. Since afflictions cannot abide in rigpa's own face, secret rigpa dharmata—existence, non-existence, permanence, nihilism, thing and emptiness aspects do not fall anywhere. Outer objects and subjects, inner various thoughts holding as different, secret rigpa itself grasping also none—knowing own face

[14406-14407]
.

Third topic: Summarizing meaning through self-display faculties' liberation way has three: faculties' division generally shown, liberation-delusion sequence specifically explained, and faculties' individual liberation way extensively spoken

[14408-14411]
.

Emaho!

[14412-14418]
.

Wisdom appearance manner one, delusion basis of aspects one, realization measure one, knowing analysis one, self-display liberation manner one—each arise separately, so faculties also explained as twenty-one

[14419-14424]
.

From Self-Arising: "Hey faithful retinue, listen! I have taught beings' ignorance. Since appearance arising modes are twenty-one, understand these well"

[14421-14440]
; then body also har rising able comes. Thus arisen, eye's thusness dharmata direct appearance shown; eyes arisen, thigle empty space lamp thumb-index showing, like placed, clear light self-existing this is; from body exiting time, dharmata bardo self-equipped dawning, self-appearance this is, not other—recognize self.

Three times struck

[14425-14429]
.

Faculties shown with three types: supreme, medium, supreme has seven—supreme's final, supreme's medium, supreme's supreme, supreme's peak, supreme's excellent, supreme's best, supreme's complete

[14430-14440]
.

This is supreme's division. That also, seeing-return one, wisdom appearance birth manner one, realization measure one, understanding time one, knowing analysis one—arising and abiding stability in respective appearance obtained

[14441-14460]
, appearance seen or instruction heard, saying, voice emerging good; sign arisen also succeeded. Dharmata bardo non-conceptual samadhi obtained, becoming Buddha certain.

Sun-Moon Union

[14441-14446]
.

Medium also has seven—medium's final, medium's medium, medium's supreme, medium's peak, medium's excellent, medium's best, medium's complete. That also wisdom birth measure one arises

[14442-14480]
Listen well, you who practice the Dharma! Previous essential instruction: Having grown familiar with three crucial points, recognizing face—like recognizing a familiar object, at that time without doubt, liberated

[14442-14444]
.

This time's essential instruction: Sharp rigpa rising from ground like a shooting star in space, instantly knowing own face and liberating

[14445-14446]
. Dull rigpa, not recognizing appearance's distinctions, through power of previous profound practice, like a lion cub separating from womb, coarse purified, instant five, twenty-one faculties' whichever way liberated

[14447-14450]
.

These also from Union of Sun and Moon: "This time has three: entering time, liberation time, completion time"

[14447-14456]
.

This is medium's. Final also has seven—final's final, final's medium, final's supreme, final's peak, final's excellent, final's best, final's complete

[14451-14455]
.

Entering time is two: rigpa entering into light, and light entering into rigpa

[14456-14458]
.

Liberation is three: rigpa liberated from conditions and elements; rigpa without stains, liberated from afflictions; rigpa itself not falling anywhere, liberated from outer and inner phenomena

[14457-14464]
.

Emaho!

[14459-14404]
.

Completion is rigpa itself all phenomena's appearance simultaneously liberated [14405].

Method is two: previous essential instruction's crucial point and this time's sharp-dull difference

[14461-14480]
: "If benefiting others, that compassion mind-grasping, three doors door-opened, breath blocked, inhaled, thrown; three syllables entering, body-speech-mind strengthened, breath with skilled do. Thus repeatedly done, that person's appearance like this: if body's strength obtained, instructions strike; awareness clear, intention equally placed; faculties' doors self-near, eye's thusness look; equally abiding mind arisen, non-conceptual samadhi obtained."

This instruction

[14466-14503]
You who seek liberation, listen! From Union of Sun and Moon: "Twenty-one faculties' individual stability obtained also exists. Those not understanding their own knowledge and without lama's teaching become bewildered at that appearance—surprise, fear, confusion, terror, losing perception, and so forth—taking samsara's near appropriation again. Thus twenty-one faculties' individual delusion also exists"

[14466-14474]
.

Thus three faculties: Supreme liberate in three instants. Medium may obtain stability in five days

[14475-14477]
. Twenty-one instants obtain stability. Finals are born in natural nirmanakaya realm, breathing out without bardo, becoming Buddha

[14478-14479]
.

Here three: twenty-one faculties' delusion manner, liberation manner, and reversing delusion about difference manner

[14480-14483]
.

First: Those who haven't seen this teaching's gate, though seen, influenced by cowardice, laziness, and distraction—final of finals not obtaining power over dharmata bardo's self-display, greatly bewildered, not finding certainty, greatly appearing, wondering what lineage they come from, not recognizing face so frightened, not practicing even an instant directly, wondering if this is delusion or faculties' delusion, perception mistaken, and so on—taking samsara's near appropriation again, wandering through bardo, twenty-one faculties' delusion exists

[14481-14500]
is crucial provision-striking, great perfection's crucial vital point. Thus faculties gathered, again death reversed by crucial, now not dead effort crucial!

Emaho!

[14481-14518]
My devoted ones, understand! First: Sharp, medium, dull faculties each have final, medium, supreme, peak, excellent, best, and complete—seven each, making twenty-one

[14484-14494]
.

Emaho!

[14501-14520]
—heat upward dissolving, best ka-dag, middle bardo, last nirmanakaya breath-giving certain; ordinary beings born in higher realms, breath-giving. Also: dying time eyes making film, sign-heat gathering, animal birth.

Right hand waving

[14521-14540]
, heat gathering at crown—god. Words confused, heat gathering right armpit—asura. Left foot earth-pounding, heat gathering foot sole—hell. Body yellow, lusterless, heat gathering throat—preta. Words clear, memory not lost, heat gathering eyes—human birth.

Sun-Moon Union

[14541-14580]
: "Outer appearance like this: if heat upward dissolving, great breath-giving becomes; eyes unclear making film, lower realm places born; right hand waving, that person god-place; mouth words confused, asura likewise born; left foot earth-pounding, hell-place; body color yellow lusterless, preta-realm; mouth sentient-being voice speaking, animal-place; tongue stammering mouth meeting, likewise animal birth-place; words clear memory not lost, human-place."

Outer signs these

[14581-14587]
, inner signs these joined: crown heat gathering, god-place; likewise foot sole heat gathering, hell-place; right armpit heat gathering, asura-realm; likewise throat heat gathering, preta-realm; likewise sign heat gathering, animal birth-place; eyes heat gathering, human birth.
