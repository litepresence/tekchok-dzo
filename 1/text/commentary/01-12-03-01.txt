Sixteen element leaves: from four come wind essences, from four come wisdom-fire essences, from three come earth-yellow essences, from three come water-blood essences.

Emaho! The throat wheel where speech becomes dharma! Press, shake, draw—liberation is in your very channels!

Second, outer channels' petals individually explained: From that, throat wheel's channels—all should know thus! That wheel's front-back: fire-spark-like channel one!

Left a-named great-turtle channel—cut for madness-fainting! Do you see? Your own body holds the cure—channels as medicine!

Emaho! The healer and healed are one!
