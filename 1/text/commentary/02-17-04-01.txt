Now listen carefully, brave yogin! The second topic: extensively explaining the twenty-one natures of secret great definite conduct and the progressive practice of vajra song and dance.

First, from the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra, these twenty-one conducts:

By bee-like conduct, enjoy all dharmas' taste; by deer-like conduct, abandon delusion's conditioned objects; by mute-like conduct, abandon various delusion speech; by peacock-like conduct, cut secret mantra doubt; by madman-like conduct, abandon dwelling on single objects; by lion-like conduct, go to charnel-grounds and abandon fear mind; by dog and pig-like conduct, abandon pure and impure thoughts; by cloud-like conduct, experience memory and thought instantly; by child-like conduct, abandon long delusion clinging; by echo-like conduct, guide the world according to words; by elephant-like conduct, turn the depth of samsara's battles; by deer-like conduct (again), abandon son and enemy concepts; by tortoise-like conduct, decide desire's content in time; by bear-like conduct, do not spread samsara's seed; by brahmin-like conduct, abandon enjoying others' food; by heroine-like conduct, divide samsara-nirvana boundary; by water-letter-like conduct, place memory support in self-place; by sky-dagger conduct, completely use phenomena; by mid-air wind-like conduct, abandon grasping and holding thoughts; by garuda-like conduct, cut abyss waves; by mountain-like conduct, above use unchanging self-pure; by thunder-like conduct, use appearance outward without turning.

Thus twenty-two enumeration exists, although two deer-like conducts gather as one—explained as twenty-one.

[2147-2168]
Second: the three aspects of vajra song and dance progressively—song dance time, song dance actuality, song dance benefit.

First: the time of conduct that divides samsara-nirvana boundary, and accumulation, and empowerment, and mandala accomplishment time, and samadhi above spreading time—these five kinds of pure time, ordinary beings cannot see, done secretly. From that itself: whatever yogin possesses fortune, when time comes to go in charnel-grounds, again and again take up vajra song, dwell in non-thought meditation with companions. Before going to all conduct, therefore itself take vajra song, enter accumulation, empowerment, mandala—that time diligently do song. Time relies on non-think mind; this occasion itself should take it up.

[2169-2177]
Particularly: the supreme explains mind settling and dullness cutting. From that: whatever meditation you enter, this settle-enter it is. If yogin experiences dullness, cutting this samadhi is good—self-rigpa's great bliss beats, linking mahamudra itself.

Emaho! Twenty-one conducts! All are skillful means to cut through fixation. Don't cling to any one—use them all as paths to freedom!

[2311-2314]
From the Sun-Moon Union: By the wisdom of hearing, cut through outer superimpositions. By the wisdom of contemplation, cut through inner superimpositions. By the wisdom of meditation, cut through secret superimpositions.

Listen to this! Longchenpa is describing how to use the three wisdoms to cut through three types of conceptual overlays. First, through study and hearing, you cut through the outer projections—the way you superimpose concepts onto external phenomena. Then through contemplation, you cut through the inner projections—the way you superimpose onto your own thoughts and emotions. Finally through meditation, you cut through the secret projections—the deepest, most subtle layers of conceptual mind.

This is the progressive deepening of insight. Don't think you can skip to the end! You have to work through these stages. Study cuts the gross concepts. Contemplation cuts the subtle concepts. Meditation cuts the most secret, hidden conceptual patterns.

[2315-2316]
As a companion to that: Without doubt, entering the peacock's house—the peacock eats poison and transforms it into beautiful plumage. Before entering, superimpositions must be cut through, finished, so that confusion doesn't come. Having cut through the superimpositions of hearing and contemplation, take the instructions you're confident in into experience.

The peacock conduct! Do you know what this means? The peacock eats poisonous snakes, but instead of dying, it transforms that poison into the beauty of its feathers. This is the conduct of the tantric practitioner who takes whatever arises—afflictions, obstacles, problems—and transforms them into the path. But you can't do this if you haven't first cut through your conceptual overlays! Otherwise you're just a deluded person eating poison, not a peacock.

[2317-2318]
As a companion to that: The deer-like conduct—not in the domain of all, dwelling alone on a mountain where people don't go out of fear of falling into samsara, taking experience. Like a deer hiding alone out of fear of hunters.

This is the hermit's way. The deer is incredibly sensitive, aware, alert. It stays away from human habitation because it knows the danger. The practitioner who takes up this conduct is like that—sensitive to the dangers of samsara, staying alone in mountain retreats, not mingling with society. Not because they don't like people, but because they need the solitude to deepen their practice.

[2319-2320]
As a companion to that: The mute-like conduct—ceasing speech, not speaking with anyone.

Sometimes you need to stop talking completely. Not just reducing speech, but actual silence. No conversation, no teaching, no social interaction. Just silence. Do you know how powerful this is? When you stop talking, the mind begins to settle. The constant chatter that maintains your sense of self begins to fade.

[2321-2322]
When you do this, memory becomes rigid—madman-like conduct. Body, speech, and mind's conduct without planetary attachment, arising spontaneously like a madman.

Now this is dangerous territory! The madman conduct—acting without social conventions, without the normal constraints of decorum. This is an advanced practice for those who have stable realization. They act spontaneously, without attachment to purity or impurity, without worrying about what others think. But listen: if you try this without stable realization, you're just a crazy person, not a realized yogi!

[2323-2324]
At this time, pure and impure not distinguished, dog-pig-like conduct arises from dawn—enjoying whatever food and clothing without picking and choosing.

This is transcending the ordinary human obsessions with cleanliness and purity. The dog eats garbage. The pig wallows in mud. They don't discriminate. In the same way, the advanced practitioner is beyond pure and impure. Whatever comes, they accept. Simple food, simple clothes—no complaints, no preferences. Can you do this? Can you let go of your refined tastes and discriminating mind?

[2325-2327]
Thus when the six are complete, at that time others cannot overwhelm your manner, suppressing the far shore—lion-like conduct arises. Like a lion who has no fear or anxiety about anything, this yogin, free from the harm of all humans and non-humans, arises with the ability to overpower anything.

The lion conduct—this is mastery. The six conducts have come to completion. Now the practitioner is fearless, powerful, beyond all harm. They can transform appearances at will. But look at the progression! This doesn't happen at the beginning. It comes after the peacock conduct, the deer conduct, the mute conduct, the madman conduct, the dog-pig conduct. Each one builds on the previous.

[2328-2333]
If you give these conducts a personal name, they're called "conduct that transforms appearances." Moreover, able to overpower others' minds, able to kill and restore, accomplishing miracles, dharmata's experience blazing like alcohol intoxication, free from fear in any direction, the ability to transform the four elements arises.

The powers that arise—these are siddhis, accomplishments. But don't grasp at them! They're byproducts of realization, not goals to achieve. The real accomplishment is the freedom from fear, the blazing confidence of dharmata, the natural power that comes from recognizing your own nature.

Don't think you're ready for this conduct! Most practitioners are not. These are advanced practices for those with stable realization. If you try to act like a madman or like a dog without the inner stability, you'll just create confusion and harm.

[2334]
Second, the instruction's method of appearance direct-placement: whatever appears, by seeing mind-itself placed directly on top of appearance...

This is the key instruction! Whatever appears in your experience—thoughts, emotions, perceptions—you place your mind directly on top of it. Not analyzing it, not following it, not rejecting it. Just direct placement, naked awareness meeting naked appearance. This is the essence of the practice.

Emaho! These conducts are the expressions of realization, not the causes of it.

[2335-2346]
Like snow falling on rock salt—on top of the appearance itself, self-liberation goes spontaneously, instantly. That also: arising appearance, ceasing appearance, coming and going appearance, and so forth—training in phenomena as different pieces, grasping and attachment liberated. Although appearing, empty of truth—like reflections, water-moon, sound-echo, emanations, illusions, mirages, optical illusions, like a dream horse completely pure.

Listen to this! Longchenpa gives you eight metaphors for how appearances are: like snow on rock salt, like reflections in a mirror, like the moon in water, like echoes, like magical emanations, like illusions created by a magician, like a mirage, like optical illusions, like a dream. What do all these have in common?

They appear, but they're not real! The reflection appears, but you can't drink it. The echo sounds, but has no source. The dream horse seems completely real while you're dreaming, but leaves no trace when you wake. This is how all phenomena are—they appear, vividly, but they're empty of inherent existence.

The practice is to see this directly. When appearances arise, let them self-liberate instantly, like snow falling on salt and dissolving immediately. Don't try to stop appearances. Don't try to maintain them. Just let them arise and cease naturally, seeing their empty nature.

[2347]
Training in dharmata's unborn nature, the general form of dharmas, realizing peaceful from the primordial like space.

This is the view. All dharmas—all phenomena—are unborn. They never truly came into existence. They're peaceful from the very beginning, like space itself. Space has no center, no edge, no coming or going. In the same way, the nature of mind is unborn, peaceful, completely open.

[2348-2364]
From the Six Vastnesses:

In the mind-itself where arising exists,
By self-dawning of six-realms' appearances,
Different forms are grasped,
Appearance matures complete as form.

In the mind-itself where ceasing exists,
By self-dawning as impermanent cause,
In appearances without nature,
Complete like a dream.

In the mind-itself where elaboration exists,
By self-dawning of various appearances,
In individual appearances of five gates,
Complete on the ground of grasping self-ground.

In the mind-itself where showing exists,
By self-dawning of sounds, words, names,
Concepts and minds self-pure,
Guru's secret instruction complete.

This is the Six Vastnesses tantra, pointing to how everything arises from mind. The six realms appear from mind. Forms appear from mind. Impermanence appears from mind. Concepts appear from mind. Everything is the self-dawning of mind's nature.

But notice: it says the appearances are grasped, that they mature complete as form, that they're like a dream, that they're complete on the ground of grasping. This is describing how the whole world appears—vividly, completely—yet it's all mind. The grasping creates the solidity, but the nature remains pure.

The guru's secret instruction is this: concepts and minds are self-pure. You don't need to purify them. You don't need to transform them. They're already pure from the beginning. Just recognize this!

Don't think these are just poetic descriptions. This is pointing to your actual experience. Right now, as you read these words, the appearance is vivid. But where is it? In your mind. And what is your mind? Unborn, peaceful, like space. This is the nature of your present experience.

Emaho! All appearances are the play of your own mind, like reflections in a mirror.

[2387-2401]
From the Pearl Garland: Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields—liberated in family and family's lord. Thus it is said. Conditions are liberated by conditions, so I do not rely on observed dharmas. Objects are liberated in objects, so I do not rely on the two grasping and holding. Cause is liberated in cause itself, so I do not rely on the two samsara and nirvana. Dharmas are liberated in dharmas, so I do not rely on concepts and words. Mind-itself is liberated in mind, so I do not rely on indicating mind.

Listen to this! From the Pearl Garland tantra—everything self-liberates. The aggregates liberate themselves. The elements liberate themselves. The sense-fields liberate themselves. Conditions liberate themselves. Objects liberate themselves. Mind liberates itself.

What does this mean? It means you don't need to do anything! The liberation is already happening. The problem is your reliance, your grasping, your trying to fix things. Longchenpa repeats: "I do not rely." This is the key!

You don't need to rely on observed phenomena. You don't need to rely on grasping and holding. You don't need to rely on samsara or nirvana. You don't need to rely on concepts and words. You don't even need to rely on mind!

This is the ultimate freedom—complete non-reliance. Not rejection, but non-reliance. Things are as they are. Let them be. Don't try to control them, don't try to change them, don't try to rely on them for your happiness or your understanding. Just let everything self-liberate.

[2402-2416]
From the Six Vastnesses:

In mind-itself where six-aggregates appear,
Thought-assemblies self-place pure.

In mind-itself where sounds and words appear,
Concepts and names self-place pure.

In mind-itself where coarse appearances,
Four elements' conditions self-place pure.

In mind-itself where grasping and holding appear,
Binding self-grasp pure.

In mind-itself where existence appears,
Phenomena self-place pure.

In mind-itself where non-existence appears,
Emptinesses self-place pure.

In mind-itself where existence and non-existence,
Establishing extremes self-place pure.

This is the view of the Great Perfection. Everything is self-pure in its own place. The six aggregates—self-pure. Thoughts—self-pure. Concepts—self-pure. The four elements—self-pure. Grasping and holding—self-pure. Even the idea of existence—self-pure. The idea of non-existence—self-pure. Both existence and non-existence together—self-pure.

What does "self-place pure" mean? It means each phenomenon is already pure in its own nature. You don't need to purify it. You don't need to transform it. You don't need to do anything to it. It's already pure from the beginning.

This is why the guru's instruction is so crucial. Once you receive this pointing-out instruction and recognize it, you see that everything has always been pure. The thoughts you've been trying to stop—they're pure. The emotions you've been trying to control—they're pure. The world you've been trying to understand—they're pure.

Stop trying to fix your mind! Stop trying to purify your experience! It's already pure. Just recognize this. That's all.

Emaho! Everything self-liberates in its own place!

[2447-2458]
From that itself: By the twenty-one progressive trainings of mind-holding—first, placing on the ground; second, separating body-mind; third, seeing dharmata. At this time, possessing the body, speech, and mind piths, the yogin should settle. Mixing the moving wind-horse, throwing and gathering, if you rely skillfully on the three piths, mind's thoughts' continuum ceases. Thus spoke the meaning—to take into experience in three.

Listen! Now Longchenpa is giving you specific meditation techniques. Twenty-one progressive trainings for holding the mind. He condenses them into three main phases:

First: Settling the mind on the ground—finding stability, establishing the foundation.
Second: Separating body and mind—loosening the identification with physical form.
Third: Seeing dharmata—recognizing the nature of reality.

This is the path! You start by settling, then you separate, then you see. Don't think you can skip ahead. If you try to see dharmata before you've settled the mind, you'll just be imagining things. If you try to separate body-mind before settling, you'll just be scattered.

The three piths—body, speech, and mind—must be possessed, meaning you work with all three. The wind-horse (your energy, your prana) must be mixed with the practice, thrown out and gathered in. When you do this skillfully, thoughts naturally cease. Not by force, not by suppression, but by the natural power of the practice.

[2459-2476]
Seven groups—first, self-mind dwelling on the ground. Second, body-mind separated from grasping attachment. Third, showing the seeing of dharmata.

First, the seven characteristics: Holding mind on white A. Suitable ground, comfortable cushion, body sitting cross-legged, meditate on white A shining at the nose-tip. When wind goes out, A also goes out. When drawing in, A also comes in—think this and mix with wind and meditate.

This is the White A practice—a classic Dzogchen technique. You visualize a white Tibetan letter A at the tip of your nose. As you breathe out, it goes out with the breath. As you breathe in, it comes in. You synchronize the visualization with your breathing. This gives the mind something to focus on while also working with the energy.

Why the nose-tip? This is the meeting point of the inner and outer. The breath comes in and out here. By placing the A here, you're working at the threshold between your inner world and the outer world.

If the body has hot disease, think that A has cold touch. If cold disease, think hot touch. Train day and night. An uncommon experience of mind free from emanating and gathering arises. All body-piths and wind-piths are equal.

This is the healing aspect! The visualization isn't just for concentration—it's also medicine. Hot disease, you visualize cooling. Cold disease, you visualize heating. The mind has power over the body when you know how to use it.

If dull, holding mind on the letter PHA—put one-pointed awareness, and saying PHAT fiercely, awareness comes thought-free, ha-de-ba, until thoughts don't arise, hold the mind, also saying PHAT day and night, taking into experience, mind emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation arises.

When you're dull, sleepy, scattered—use PHAT! This is fierce. PHAT is a wrathful mantra syllable. You say it sharply, fiercely. It cuts through the dullness like a sword. The awareness becomes sharp, clear, thought-free. This is the nature of mind itself—emptiness and clarity together.

Also, holding mind on the wrathful one's pleasure laugh. Saying HA fiercely and short, placing mind as before, thought-free clear resonance experience arises.

The wrathful deities' laughter—HA! Short, fierce, cutting through everything. This is another technique for when you need sharpness, clarity, intensity.

Holding mind on asuras' quarrel and dispute—sitting on mountain-peaks or rock-tops, etc.

This is about taking the challenging energy of conflict and using it as the path. Asuras are always fighting—this represents our own aggressive, competitive mind. Instead of suppressing it, you take it to a high place (mountain peak) and use that energy.

Emaho! These are the skillful means—twenty-one ways to work with the mind!

[2573-2577]
Listen, friend! Who meditates union-bliss—by this, makes sense-objects the path. Who makes intermediate-space the path—by this, obtains power over mind. Thus it is. Don't reject appearances—transform them into the path of bliss!

[2578-2598]
Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, the method of holding mind upon five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. From the Thalgyur: eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Train upon the ground of five sense-objects!

Forms—face-shapes and forms, arts and illusions, different types, and eye-magic etc.—various appearances. Sounds—lute, vase-drum, stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and pheng, har, etc. Smells—fragrance joined, and do through pleasing dependent-arising profound. Tastes—molasses with six, and grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed, dependent-arising branches joined.

Touch—the skilled one sits upon throne, scriptures mixed, joined elements, and by means of some tree leaves, by touch alone upon dharmata, dwells with non-separated mind. Thus it is.

[2599-2628]
Especially, the stages of making four elements yoga. From that is spoken: training stage of three kayas itself, making qualities of elements chief, and supreme—earth, water, fire, wind. Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished.

Upon explanation of water's sound, holds dakini's sound-melody. If always familiarized with this, certainly accomplishes emanation-body. Earth's sound—cool and heavy, possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice. If always hearing-training upon this, certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body. Fire's sound—self-made, trained, shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody. Who practices hearing upon this, certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities. Wind's sound—cutting, resounding, Garuda king's practice-speech. If knowing this always reciting, common training of three kayas.

Thus, sound-meaning of four elements, certainly apply to outer times. Winter, spring, summer, autumn—water, earth, fire, wind—apply certainly to sequence of times, and if made suited to yoga body, accomplishment—without doubt in this. Thus it is.

Emaho! Four elements yoga! Everything is the path when you know how to use it!

[2629-2637]
Now listen! Gods and humans have their meditation practices too. What's their method? They hold the mouth and nose breath, make mind thought-free and unmoved—this is one-pointed awareness essence. No instantaneous thoughts, they say.

But does this show the great true meaning? No! It cannot indicate it. Stop right there! Don't think "thought-free" is the goal. It's just the beginning, not the end.

[2638-2671]
Second, the bodhisattvas' meditation—two types: actual divisions and auxiliary arisen. First, briefly taught: from Rangshar—bodhisattvas' meditation is held by mind, arises by manner or force. Familiarized, becomes expanse, abandons food-concept. Ground-dwellers practice it. Thought-free by manner.

But this also cannot indicate the great meaning! Why? Because the nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light—not merely thought-free dwelling. Therefore cannot indicate great meaning.

Extensively explained—three types: Nature-force meditation arises spontaneously, non-thought manner, just placing body-speech relaxed. Focused-support meditation meditates antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, just suppressing afflictions' heads. Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration, only purifying self-ground latencies.

From Sun-Moon Union: Great Vehicle's meditation—by nature-force, unfabricated body-speech relaxed. By focused-support, suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads. By ground-dwellers', sustains self-self continuum.

Do you see? All these are methods, not recognition!

[2672-2685]
Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two: nature and fabricated. First, nature meditation—sentient beings all, when awareness distracted, arises from slightly trembling abiding, exists upon archer's eye, upon sleeping eye within rabbit and eagle, etc. Briefly: exists always when mind-consciousness is distracted.

Second is fabricated meditation: meditation, concentration, non-thought, thought-with deity generation-completion—all fabricated deliberately by mind, because deliberately done by intellect.

Emaho! Don't mistake these for Dzogchen, friend! Gods, humans, and bodhisattvas—their meditations are steps on the path, not the final recognition!
