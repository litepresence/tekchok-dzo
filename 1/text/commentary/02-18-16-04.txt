Listen here, you who love to count spiritual achievements! Longchenpa lists sixteen grounds of Great Perfection like they're some staircase you climb. But listen carefully - he's about to shatter your whole idea of progress!

First three grounds: "letter wheel great gathering ground conquered," "wisdom's vision abiding is fourteenth samadhi great ground conquered," "spontaneous presence ground certainly obtained is fifteenth vajra-holder ground obtained." Do you hear the numbers? Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen! This isn't mathematics - it's showing how conceptual mind loves to categorize and rank everything!

But then comes the crucial teaching: "Then primordial purity ground wisdom spontaneous dawns, above that other not-existing is, sixteenth wisdom teacher ground obtained, thus said!" Primordial purity ground - this is your own nature! When wisdom dawns in that ground, you don't move to another place. Above that, "other not-existing" - no higher attainment possible! The sixteenth ground is "wisdom teacher" - not because you've become something special, but because you recognize you've been wisdom all along!

[5943-5953]
Now the master explains the danger: "These also appearance manner portions similar each joined merely, bodhisattva's ground ten actual not!" Do you understand? The sixteen grounds aren't sixteen different experiences to have! They're "appearance manner portions" - different ways recognition shows itself. Similar each, joined merely - not separate accomplishments but one recognition appearing differently!

"Bodhisattva's ground ten actual not!" - Oh, how this smashes your bodhisattva ambition! You think you need to complete ten stages before starting Dzogchen? Longchenpa says the actual grounds of bodhisattvas are only ten - and those aren't even real achievements, just conventional designations!

[5954-5962]
And the profound point: "Also those grounds root awareness luminous-clear traverse not ground one's vision portion difference merely!" The root of all these grounds isn't some special vision - it's awareness itself, luminous and clear! "Traverse not ground one's vision portion" - you don't journey through different states. "Difference merely" - there's no real separation between one ground and another!

"Actually awareness's ground one merely, buddha vajra-holder obtain to cause ground particular existing not-need!" - This is revolutionary! All sixteen grounds are the same single ground of awareness! Becoming "buddha vajra-holder" doesn't add anything to your nature - it's just recognizing what's already true!

"Path main-point different entering door thus applied merely!" - Don't you see? All the methods, all the practices, are just "different entering doors" to the same room. The door doesn't matter - entering is what counts!

Emaho! Sixteen grounds? One ground! Stop counting and start recognizing!

[Final]
What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
