[474-496]
First, the five life-holding winds:
1. Root-holding life
2. Protecting life
3. Spreading life
4. Impure life
5. Shattering life

Their functions:
1. Producing awareness potential
2. Producing bindhu (essence) potential
3. Producing light potential
4. Holding the root of non-awareness (ignorance)
5. Acting as helper to mind

The life wind potential relies on and abides in awareness potential. This is crucial: the vital energy and awareness are intimately connected. Second, the five fire-equal winds:
1. Wind separating clear from impure
2. Wind producing warmth
3. Wind of clear-change (transforming clarity)
4. Wind gathering distinctions
5. Wind making praise

These support the digestive fire and transformative processes.

[497-501]
The five fire-equal winds are nondual with:
- Life
- Awareness
- Lamp (of wisdom)
- Bindhu (essence)
- Wisdom

This nonduality is key—they're not separate things but different aspects of the same reality.

[502-512]
Third, the five color-and-radiance-producing winds:
1. Consciousness-producing wind
2. Wind arising from mind
3. Wind possessing radiance
4. Wind of burning
5. Wind of wildness

Their objects:
- Wisdom object
- Appearing object
- Lamp object
- Non-awareness object
- Mind's object (the "horse" that carries mind)

These winds are responsible for the clarity and radiance of consciousness, producing the various cognitions and perceptions.

[513-526]
Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
1. Pervading the base
2. Pervading immediately
3. Pervading hatred and fear
4. Pervading memory
5. Pervading all body by holding

They appear in:
- Wisdom
- Lamp
- Knowing
- Thinking
- Mind's potency

These winds enable the spread of awareness throughout experience—cognitive, emotional, and physical.

[527-540]
Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
1. Wind of making movement
2. Wind of making liberation
3. Wind of making reversal
4. Wind of making swiftness
5. Wind of moments

They pervade:
- Aggregates
- Moments (instantaneous time)
- Bardo
- Concepts
- Three: moments, actions, completion

These are the most subtle winds connected with karma and the process of death and transition.

[541-557]
Thus twenty-five winds gather into five roots. The etymology from Self-Arisen:
- "Move-making wind"—because it makes movement on true ground
- "Life-holding wind"—because it holds life of pure wisdom
- "Color-radiance wind"—because it's the self-nature of five wisdom lights
- "Compassionless karma wind"—because it can liberate into wisdom's true dimension
- "Fire-equal wind"—because it abides without gathering or separating from wisdom's appearing

The essential point: in the five essence winds, relying on awareness wisdom, abiding in the heart, wisdom's self-sound-potential clears as five lights. When awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathers. The non-manifest outer and inner arrives at the essential point of pure wind-mind.

This is describing the completion stage realization where wind and mind merge into wisdom.

[552-553]
Now listen close—you want the heart of this in brief? Here it is. Longchenpa's pointing at what you already are, right now, reading these words. That awareness jewel of yours, it's not some treasure you dig up from the ground. It's primordially pure essence abiding in the secret cavity, in the palace of luminous self-nature. Don't go hunting for a palace somewhere else! This body of yours, this very mind—that's the palace. Essence, nature, compassion—these three aren't separate things you stack up like blocks. They're the master itself, inseparable, abiding as one. You looking for three different experiences? You'll miss the one that's staring you in the face!

[554-557]
Look here—when essence abides as kaya, its own purpose isn't some object you can point at. It's not clear like "this is it." Yet it's self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from a base that never stops, never ceases. Your nature is the base where five lights arise, where life wind moves, where four branches dance. This isn't theory, friend—this is what's happening in your chest right now, primordially abiding as the essence of speech. And compassion? It's self-arisen awareness essence, spontaneously complete. Not "becoming" complete—already complete! The wisdom of two-knowing—this is what you are, abiding without shift or change, without kaya and wisdom ever separating or gathering. Stop trying to unite what was never apart!

[558-560]
What are these two knowings? Listen: depending on the inner-clear essence of dharmata—everything known. Depending on the outer-clear aspect of what's appearing—all aspects known. It's like this: you know what's inside the room, you know what's outside. But it's not two different knowers! One awareness, two ways of shining. Don't make this complicated.

[561-562]
Five winds—now pay attention to your breath. Root life wind, the portion of compassion awareness wisdom—if pure, it's Buddha wisdom. If impure, it's the base of sentient beings' confused aggregates. Same wind, different recognition. The difference between buddha and sentient being isn't in the wind itself—it's in whether you recognize what it is!

[563-567]
From that root, four branch winds emanate like rays from the sun—that's compassion's potency displaying. Upward-going wisdom horse, downward-clearing wisdom ray, fire-equal ripening power, all-pervading completing power. These four aren't somewhere else—they exist only in the portion of life wind itself. In the dimension of dharmadhatu, they don't emanate out. They abide only as essence, non-ceasing base of display, essence branch clear as light. See? Not going anywhere, not coming from anywhere.

[572-582]
Kunsel says it like this—kaya abides like the form-reflection of an empty-luminous bubble. Speech abides like fire spark rays in the expanse of awareness. Mind's clear nature is life wind itself, like wisdom fire sparks without falling in any direction, abiding as five wisdoms. And all of this—wisdom that no concept can deceive. Not your thinking mind, friend. Wisdom itself, beyond the reach of your clever ideas!

[583] Emaho! What a wonder!

[584-589]
Listen—what's being described here can't be fixed or altered. You can't grab it by the face, can't mark it with labels. Like trying to catch sky in your hands! Like trying to pin down the earth under your feet! It's clear yet subtle, like fire sparks dancing behind the five lights. This is dharmakaya, the heart essence of dharmadhatu itself. And where does it abide? As awareness itself, holding the basis of everything. Don't look for it somewhere else—it's what's reading these words right now!

[590-599]
The palace where it abides—that's dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space. When dharmakaya abides in the precious cavity, it's called the pure original tone of dharmata. Awareness possessing the house of light, abiding in light's display. Longchenpa calls this the primordial common basis, the expanse of awareness—this is how the five winds connect and establish meaning. Not separate from you, friend. Never was.

[600-612]
Now five fires—from the Self-Arising Tantra. Listen to this carefully:
- Fire pervading all outer and inner
- Fire illuminating all outer and inner  
- Fire equalizing all outer and inner
- Fire of concept in outer and inner actions
- Fire accomplishing outer and inner actions

Where do these fires live? In your lungs, your eyes, your five limbs—that's six locations. In the gaps of your flesh, the soles of your feet, your palms. They produce warmth. Feel your hands right now—that warmth? That's it! Not philosophy, this is your own body speaking.

[613-626]
Five earths now, from the same source:
- All-illuminating earth
- Unchanging vajra earth
- Precious earth from which all arise
- All-pervading earth showing appearances
- Earth of perfected accomplishment

These aren't separate things somewhere else. Together with awareness, together with lamp, together with thigle, together with wisdom, together with discriminating awareness—they abide in reliance. Everything interconnected, everything supporting everything else. Like a net of jewels reflecting each other!

[627-635]
Five waters from Self-Arising:
- Unchanging water
- Peaceful, clear, pure water
- Water of extensively arising qualities
- Water without attachment
- Water of completion without grasping

These connect with all the channels. Your whole body is a mandala, friend—every part resonating with these elemental wisdoms!

Emaho! What a wonder this body of yours!

[636-639]
Five waters continue—together with all your bones, all your blood, all your lymph. They abide in your two eyes, moistening everything without holding to any fixed essence. This is the nature of water wisdom—not grasping, just flowing, just nourishing. Feel that moisture in your eyes right now? That's not just biology, friend—that's wisdom displaying!

[640-653]
Five spaces, from Self-Arising Tantra:
- Space pervading all in common
- Space of clear tone without object  
- Pure unmixed space
- Space indicating meaning
- Space liberating into pure field

These aren't five different spaces somewhere in the clouds! They're connected with actual awareness, five lights, the lamp of pure expanse, wisdom of signs, and the twenty-one pointing-out instructions. Certain confidence in example and meaning—this is what points you to what's already here!

[654-657]
So all these five elements' awareness attributes summarized—they're the great elements. Their basis is the small elements. This completes the fifteenth division from the Treasury: Showing the Place of the Elements. Don't think you're done learning, though—this was just the foundation!

[658-663]
Now that we've established elements as basis, we move to the fourfold purity of what's supported—the expanse and wisdom:
- Basis: the kayas
- Tone: the light  
- Supported: the wisdom
- Activities: enlightened actions

See the structure? Foundation first, then what rests upon it. Don't try to understand kayas without understanding what they rest upon!

[664-668]
First, the kayas—two aspects:
1. General presentation of three kayas' expanse
2.
