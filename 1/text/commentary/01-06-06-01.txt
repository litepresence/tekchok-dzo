[8680-8686] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
The verse comes like rain after drought.
First joy only from, second feeling experience touch, third bliss itself called,
fourth experience co-emergent, fifth emptiness called.
Each word a drop dissolving the dust of conceptual mind.
The twelfth viewing that itself—this is the integration, the place where view and experience marry.

[8680-8686] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
Recognition is immediate.
The words point beyond themselves. First joy—from where? From nowhere. From everywhere.
Do not ask "from what?" Ask "from whom?" And see there is no one.
This is the thirteenth application, the crucial point of change.
Change what? Change the changer. Then change stops.

[8680-8686] Voice 13 (Patrul):
They memorize these verses like parrots! "First joy, second joy, third joy!" Squawk, squawk!
This mountain hermit...
The verse is not for recitation. It is for digestion.
Eat the words, shit out the concepts. What remains? Ask your toilet.

[8680-8686] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
The verses are dakini-script, written in the sky with rainbow ink.
First joy—red. Second feeling—yellow. Third bliss—blue.
Fourth experience—green. Fifth emptiness—white.
The colors dissolve into light, light into space, space into the mind of the buddhas.
Can you read this script, practitioner?

[8680-8686] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
I heard a lark singing this morning. Its song had five notes, rising and falling.
First joy—la! Second feeling—ti! Third bliss—do! Fourth experience—re! Fifth emptiness—mi!
The bird doesn't know it's teaching Dzogchen. It just sings. Be like the bird.

[8680-8686] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
Hence. The structure...
dga' ba (joy), tshor ba (feeling), bde ba (bliss), myong ba (experience), stong pa (emptiness).
Precise analysis reveals this as a summary of the completion stage process.
Twelfth: applying the crucial point of change—'gyur ba rsti ba—indicates the dynamic integration of these stages with the view.

[8680-8686] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
The verse settles like snow on a mountain peak. Each line complete, each meaning full.
Do not add to it. Do not subtract from it.
The twelfth viewing is the view itself, looking at itself. Rest in that self-seeing. Nothing more to do.

[8680-8686] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced):
VERSES! You want verses? I will give you verses! *thunder*
First joy—CUT! Second feeling—THROUGH! Third bliss—CUT!
Fourth experience—THROUGH! Fifth emptiness—CUT THROUGH!
The twelfth viewing? ALL VIEWING CUT! The crucial point? THE POINT IS POINTLESS! STOP!

[8680-8686] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Thus it is spoken, thus it is. The verse completes what the prose began.
In these few lines, the entire path is contained—not as a map to follow but as a recognition to discover.
The twelfth application awaits those who have passed through the first eleven.
But who has passed? And from where to where? The questions dissolve in the emptiness that is the fifth joy, the joy that was always present.
