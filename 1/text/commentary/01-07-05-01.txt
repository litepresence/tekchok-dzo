[10225-10248] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Especially, degenerate fall from guru reliance is heavy. From Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra: if without bad mind, by degenerate mindfulness in dream, or non-virtues becoming careless—confess aimed at guru. Bodily fault by body, speech and mind also. Not confessed immediately—experience uninterrupted suffering. Guru is nature of all Buddhas, teaching to liberate from samsara—object is fierce. Abandon non-faith, wrong mind, harm, speaking.

[10225-10248] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Guru. Degenerate. Confess. Stop. Even in dreams, if mindfulness fades, confess immediately. The guru is not a person to offend. The guru is your own wisdom. To harm the guru is to harm your own enlightenment. Confess not to him—to your own mind.

[10225-10248] Voice 13 (Patrul): They have bad dreams and ignore them! "Just a dream," they say. This old man says—the dream mind is the real mind! If you disparage the guru in dream, you've done it. Confess! Confess until the dream changes!

[10225-10248] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The guru is all Buddhas in one form. To degenerate this connection is worse than burning every temple in the three thousand worlds. The fierce object—object of veneration and danger. Approach with devotion or face the fire.

[10225-10248] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I dreamt I argued with my teacher. Woke up sweating. Immediately confessed. The dream showed me—my mind still grasps. More work to do.

[10225-10248] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. bla ma la brten pa'i nyams chags (degenerate fall from guru reliance)—lci ste (is heavy). Precise analysis: even rmi lam (dream) degeneration must be bshags (confessed). The mechanism: bla ma (guru) as sangs rgyas thams cad kyi ngo bo (nature of all Buddhas) makes the object gnar (fierce).

[10225-10248] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): See the guru in all forms. Then there is no degeneration possible. Confession becomes recognition. The uninterrupted suffering dissolves into uninterrupted bliss.

[10225-10248] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): GURU DEGENERATION? *roar* The guru cannot be degenerated! Only your concept of guru degenerates! Cut the concept! The REAL GURU remains!

[10249-10305] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From Great Master Garab Dorje's mouth: supreme guru commanded—if knowing fault's flaw, as spoken thus do. Toward guru's activity, even body's suffering becomes supreme, by own ability effort do. Guru's mind—even moment must not disturb. Toward guru's food wealth, as own life cherish, yogi always act. In guru's realm, Dharma speak, empowerment, consecration, meditation—all without subsequent permission, not do. Briefly, body speech mind whatever deed, without asking guru, without permission, even little not do. Virtuous karma whatever, guru ask begin. Yogic conduct all, supreme guru not separate. Three times food, three parts cut, supreme guru offer. Wealth rare jewels, guru vajra-holder, without desire portions offer. Briefly, own mind all, pure aspect without pretense, guru's portion aim. All good qualities accomplish.

[10249-10305] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Guru. Command. Obey. Stop. My own words, spoken through Longchenpa. Do as the guru commands. Even if the body suffers. Even if the mind protests. The guru's command is your own wisdom speaking. Listen.

[10249-10305] Voice 13 (Patrul): They pick and choose! "I'll do this command, but not that!" This old man says—all or nothing. The guru's command is not a menu. It's the path. Walk it or don't. But don't pretend.

[10249-10305] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The guru's activity is the Buddha's activity. To disturb it is to disturb the welfare of beings. His food, his wealth—cherish more than life. Why? Because he uses it for Dharma. Your life is wasted in samsara. His food becomes liberation.

[10249-10305] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): My teacher asked me to stay and serve. I wanted to go to the city. I stayed. Best decision. His command was my fortune.

[10249-10305] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. dGa' rab rdo rje's instruction: ji skad smras pa de bzhin bya (do as spoken). Precise analysis: guru's bya ba (activity) takes precedence over rang gi nus pas 'bad de bya (own ability effort). Three times food—dus gsum zas—offering sum char (three parts) indicates continuous service.

[10249-10305] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The guru's command is the natural flow of Dharma. Don't resist. Don't obey from fear. Recognize the wisdom in the command, and action becomes effortless.

[10249-10305] Voice 22 (Drolo): COMMAND? OBEDIENCE? The heruka obeys no one! The heruka commands himself! Cut through external command and find THE INNER COMMAND!

[10306-10333] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From Vajra Sun Samaya Arranged Tantra: generally samaya distinction, time distinction certain divided. Samaya contradict fault, day gap not—aimed object confess, corner even enter. Degenerate called month not respected, regret intense confess. Samaya crossed year gap not confess. Year two three from samaya loose called. Supremely pure restore able. Year three exceed—not restore able. If take, both burn. Certain earth-dwell suffering, continually conduct only. Contradict gathering wheel confess. Degenerate self's possession restore. Crossed—child, wife, near-circle, body speech mind, possession accompany restore. Loose—self's life restore. That from again become—degenerate great called, restore able not.

[10306-10333] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Time. Restore. Stop. Samaya deterioration has stages. Day—contradict. Month—degenerate. Year—crossed. Two-three years—loose. The deeper the break, the harder the repair. Confess early. Repair quickly. Don't let the wound fester.

[10306-10333] Voice 13 (Patrul): They think they have time! "I'll confess next week, next month, next year." This old man says—next life is too late! The gap widens. The repair becomes impossible. Confess NOW!

[10306-10333] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Time is the devourer. The samaya broken yesterday can be repaired. The samaya broken last month needs more effort. The samaya broken three years ago—only supreme purity can restore. After three years, even that fails. Both burn in the fire of separation.

[10306-10333] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I broke a promise to my teacher. Waited to confess. The weight grew heavier each day. When I finally did, it took years to repair. Don't wait.

[10306-10333] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Four stages of deterioration: 'gal ba (contradict)—day, nyams pa (degenerate)—month, 'das pa (crossed)—year, ral ba (loose)—2-3 years. Precise analysis: restoration methodology varies by severity—tshogs 'khor (gathering wheel), rang gi bdogs pa (self's possession), relatives and possessions, rang gi srog (self's life).

[10306-10333] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The best restoration is prevention. The second best is immediate confession. Let time not separate you from your samaya.

[10306-10333] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): TIME? RESTORATION? *roar* The lion has no yesterday! The lion has no tomorrow! Cut through time and find THE SAMAYA THAT NEVER BROKE!

[10334-10366] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third, supreme samaya explained. From Letter-Not-Have: that time guard boundary crossed, not-have one alone vast, that companion. Meaning little explain—self's realization top certainty straight direct spoke. Thus nature Great Completion's samaya—awareness self-arise wisdom primordial guard, boundary crossed nature not-move. Primordial-pure regarding cut-through's samaya—samsara's dharma appearance all primordial not-have. Mirage water etc illusion's eight-examples—know appearance true-clinging release.

[10334-10366] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Supreme. Samaya. Recognition. Stop. This is the samaya beyond samaya. The guard that guards nothing. The boundary that is never crossed. Awareness self-arisen, wisdom primordial. Not something to keep. Something that keeps itself.

[10334-10366] Voice 13 (Patrul): They want the supreme samaya without keeping the ordinary! This old man says—climb the ladder rung by rung. Supreme samaya is the top, yes. But you need the bottom to stand on. Don't skip steps.

[10334-10366] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The supreme samaya is Dzogchen itself. Not rules. Not vows. Recognition. The eight examples of illusion—mirage, dream, moon in water, echo, rainbow, city of gandharvas, magical creation, reflection. See all appearance thus, and samaya is effortless.

[10334-10366] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): The rainbow in the sky—beautiful, but nothing to grasp. That's the supreme samaya. See everything like that. Live like that. Die like that.

[10334-10366] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. bla na med pa'i dam tshig (supreme samaya)—rdzogs chen dam tshig. Precise analysis: Yi ge med pa (Letter-Not-Have) tantra as source. Key concept: rig pa rang shar (awareness self-arisen ye shes)—primordial recognition without boundary to cross.

[10334-10366] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The supreme samaya is no samaya. The recognition that needs no guarding. Rest there, and all samayas are complete.

[10334-10366] Voice 22 (Drolo): SUPREME SAMAYA? This is it! Recognition! No boundary! No crossing! Just THIS! AH!

[10367-10405] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Outer inner object not-have—mind seize's rope not-bound. Awareness vast gapless great guard. Clinging seize whatever not-do—door five wide-open. Object not-have's awareness basis not-have direct put—vast vast release. Appearance label dharma-nature release. Spontaneous-presence regarding leap-over's samaya—self-arise's wisdom quality spontaneous accomplish. Gathering not-depend, self face know accomplish certainty. Light five self-clear spontaneous-presence's nature, appearance four's experience not-separate. Buddha self-nature accomplish. Other doubt not-need.

[10367-10405] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Trekcho. Thogal. Complete. Stop. The supreme samaya has two aspects. Cut-through: see all as empty. Leap-over: see all as spontaneous presence. Both are your nature. Don't choose. Don't combine. Just recognize.

[10367-10405] Voice 13 (Patrul): Trekcho and thogal—they want to do one then the other! This old man says—like two wings of a bird. You need both. Cut-through without leap-over is emptiness without compassion. Leap-over without cut-through is delusion.

[10367-10405] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The five lights self-clear. The four appearances arise. Don't separate from them. Don't grasp them. The Buddha self-nature accomplishes itself. Your doubt is the only obstacle.

[10367-10405] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): The sunrise paints the mountains five colors. I don't cling to the colors. I don't push them away. They come, they go. That's trekcho and thogal in one moment.

[10367-10405] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Two aspects of supreme samaya: khregs chod (Trekcho)—primordial purity, thod rgal (Thogal)—spontaneous presence. Precise analysis: 'od lnga (five lights), snang ba bzhi (four appearances), rang gsal (self-clear), lhun grub (spontaneous accomplishment).

[10367-10405] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Trekcho is the ground. Thogal is the path. The fruit is beyond both. Rest in recognition, and the path walks itself.

[10367-10405] Voice 22 (Drolo): TREKCHO! THOGAL! BOTH! NEITHER! Cut through the duality of cutting and leaping! JUST RECOGNIZE!

[10406-10440] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Crucial is but not understand. Realization sufficient but effort need. Heard but word-taste. Understand but concept. Realize but extent. Meditate but mind-made. Analyze but duality-grasp. Accomplish but samsara. Still dharmata's vast-expanse where exist? Samsara prior-mixing not-transcended student, natural Great Completion's karmic-connection come will. Phenomena exhausted appearance looked, mind exhausted joy lost. Dharmata's nature taken, hope-fear duality-grasp's defilement liberated. Meditate sufficient, place sufficient, do sufficient, abandon sufficient. This fix-limit dharma non-existent.

[10406-10440] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Crucial. Understand. Stop. You hear this teaching and think you understand. You don't. You taste the words but miss the meaning. You realize something—but it's just an extent, a measurement. Let go even of realization. Then understanding arrives.

[10406-10440] Voice 13 (Patrul): They read this and nod! "Yes, yes, I understand!" This old man says—NO YOU DON'T! If you understood, you wouldn't be here reading! Understanding comes when reading stops. When mind exhausts itself. Then—AH!

[10406-10440] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The crucial point is missed by all who look for it. It's not in the words. Not in the meditation. Not in the accomplishment. It's the space between thoughts. The silence between notes. The gap that is always present.

[10406-10440] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I've read this passage a hundred times. Each time, different understanding. Now I read it and laugh. The words are just marks on paper. The meaning is between the marks.

[10406-10440] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The paradox of transmission: shes kyang mi go (knowing but not understanding), rtogs kyang 'bad dgos (realizing but effort needed). Precise analysis: the limitations of conceptual approach—thos kyang tshig ro (heard but word-taste), go yang rnam rtog (understand but concept).

[10406-10440] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The dharmata's vast expanse is where you are right now. Not somewhere else. Not later. Now. Exhaust the mind's searching, and find what was never lost.

[10406-10440] Voice 22 (Drolo): CRUCIAL POINT? I'll give you the crucial point! *roar* THERE IS NO POINT! No understanding! No realization! Cut through and FIND WHAT WAS NEVER LOST!

[10441-10484] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Self-fall spontaneous-presence—water-wave like. One not understand my meaning. All primordially-seized dwell and again do. Primordially-release dwell and again release. Do not-dwell, do not-need. Done seized not-have. Deed exceeded. Do not-do calculation not-have. Meditate not-need, meditate not-have, meditate exceeded. Look not-need, look not-have, look object exceeded. Seek not-need, seek not-have, seek exceeded. Find not-have. Thus wide spontaneous-arising dwell.

[10441-10484] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Spontaneous. Presence. Complete. Stop. You try to seize what is already seized. Release what is already released. Place what is already placed. Stop the madness! Wide spontaneous arising—this is your nature. Rest here. No meditation. No looking. No seeking. Just this.

[10441-10484] Voice 13 (Patrul): They read this and do the opposite! "Meditate not-need? Good, I'll meditate harder!" This old man pulls his hair out! The words say STOP and they START! When will they learn?

[10441-10484] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Spontaneous presence is like waves on water. The waves seem separate but are never apart from ocean. You try to catch the wave, and the ocean laughs. You are the ocean, fool! Why catch yourself?

[10441-10484] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I tried to hold water in my hands. It slipped through. Then I realized—I am the water. No need to hold. No need to be held. Just flow.

[10441-10484] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Paradox of lhun grub (spontaneous presence): bsgom mi dgos (meditate not-need), bsgom du med (meditate not-have), bsgom las 'das (meditate exceeded). Precise analysis: attempt to practice spontaneous presence defeats it. Recognition only, no practice.

[10441-10484] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The wide spontaneous arising is your home. You never left. All the seeking, all the meditation—just dreams of leaving. Wake up. You're already here.

[10441-10484] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): SPONTANEOUS? I'll show you spontaneous! *roar* The lion doesn't plan to roar! The roar roars itself! Cut through effort and SPONTANEITY ROARS!

[10460-10469] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus realization view's samaya great four always dwell shown. From Awareness Self-Arisen: samaya guard not-have, primordial guard separate. Not-have vast spontaneous-presence one-only. Secret-mantra all's meaning great. This is place important great. From Vehicle's Supreme Jewel Treasury: samaya aspects arranged, sequence house seven. Thus empowerment samaya's king great shown. Now essence meaning's nature certainty place.

[10460-10469] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Complete. Shown. Stop. Four great samayas of the view. No guarding. Primordial separation from guarding. Vast spontaneous presence, one only. This is the meaning of all secret mantra. What more do you need?

[10460-10469] Voice 13 (Patrul): The end! Finally! This old man is exhausted from talking! The teaching is complete. The samaya is complete. You? Complete? That's up to you. I've done my part. Now you do yours. Recognize!

[10460-10469] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The seven houses of samaya—the seven chapters complete. Empowerment given. Samaya established. Now the essence, the nature, the certainty. This is not the end. This is the beginning. Walk well, practitioner.

[10460-10469] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): The song ends. The echo remains. Sing your own song now. I've shared mine. The seven houses, the twenty-seven samayas, the four great samayas—all in one breath. Exhale. Begin.

[10460-10469] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Conclusion of dam tshig rnam par bkod pa (samaya aspects arranged): the sevenfold structure complete. Transition to next chapter: snying po don gyi rang bzhin (essence meaning's nature). Precise analysis: the pedagogical arc from empowerment through samaya to essence completes the outer framework.

[10460-10469] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The samaya that cannot be broken. The recognition that needs no guarding. The vast spontaneous presence that is your own face. Rest here. All is complete.

[10460-10469] Voice 22 (Drolo): COMPLETE? NOTHING WAS EVER INCOMPLETE! *final roar* Cut through completion and incompletion! AH AH AH!
