[999-1005]
Fourth tier: the elevated-born to four directions. Virūpākṣa sees all—eyes that are not eyes but the seeing itself. Virūḍhaka, son of hearing, Dhṛtarāṣṭra guarding the land. They dwell with retinues, surrounded by palaces and pleasure-groves. Sandalwood water on golden ground, mandāra blossoms to the knee. This is not geography. This is the architecture of perception when perception knows itself.

[1006-1012]
The Sun's palace spans fifty-one yojanas, base of fire-crystal. The Moon self-arisen from water-crystal, fenced in gold and silver, four jewel towers. Fifty yojanas the Moon extends. Stars large and small, circling the four continents by nature each day. This is not astronomy. These are coordinates for states of clarity. The celestial mechanics describe the mechanics of attention.

[1013-1026]
Above, the Thirty-Three: city, grove, ground, tree, five assembly-places. Indra's palace surrounding, Completely Victorious Palace at center. One hundred fifty yojanas each side, rising five and a half yojanas, eight stories, seven stacked houses, seven times seven rooms. The numbers are precise because the structure is precise. This is your own mind when mapped by those who have traveled it.

[1027-1041]
Four pleasure-groves: Chariot-Various to the east—ponds, cloth, chariots, decoration. Rough-Transformation to the south—hard armors arising in battle. Enjoyment-Mixing to the west—immeasurable enjoyment. Everywhere-Joy to the north—free from sorrow, brilliant with joy. Two hundred fifty yojanas wide, well-shaped, beautiful. The directions are not compass points. They are qualities of experience.

[1042-1054]
Inside, ground spreads with golden sand, jewel flower-beds, lakes and ponds. Outside, similar ground, many flowers, equal measure to four parks. The symmetry is not decorative. It is the symmetry of a mind that has found its balance. What appears within appears without. The boundary was never there.

[1055-1061]
The tree at northeast—Complete Gather Burst. Root five yojanas down, branches spreading like umbrella, circumference fifty yojanas curling. Jewel net, divine cloth hanging. Near it, white rock like armonig, fifty yojanas wide, Indra's throne, falling flower rain. The tree is the central channel. The throne is where you sit when you stop looking for a seat.

[1062-1076]
Assembly-place Dharma-Good, round, jewel tree surrounded, three hundred yojanas wide, nine hundred circumference. Indra's throne, gods' seats arranged. Measureless houses in sky above, desire and form dwellers, spread like planets and stars. Double size for larger ones. The sky between—eighty thousand yojanas from Jambu to Thirty-Three. These measurements map not space but capacity.

[1077-1096]
Thus attached, yet one intermediate eon this vessel world becomes empty, free from beings. Mountains and hills with trees, grass, flowers. Valleys as forests, thickets, rain from sky expands jewel trees. Then essence attaches in four stages. Nectar rain releases vapor, ripens jewel trees of lotus nature. Wind goddesses, water dancing goddesses, naga sons—their mind-enters awaken latent seeds. Formless ripened consciousness becomes samādhi emanation body. Self-appearance completely pure—neither body nor not-body, subtle mind, coarse flesh, clear light. Neither existing nor not-existing: realms and elements.

[1097-1118]
Samādhi emanation body sometimes appearing, sometimes not—thus called neither existent nor non-existent. These realms dwell on Padma-Stacked peak's sky. Immeasurable expansion from these, abiding in Sūraṅgama samādhi, peaceful samādhi's own light and bliss. Below, Mind-Play Wheel sky, one great golden vajra arose upward, immeasurable light-rays radiating, extremely beautiful, heroic. From delusion, upper beings go in samādhi emanation bodies. Seeing vajra, beautifully seeing—this is Sūraṅgama samādhi.

[1119-1140]
Mind moved by emanation vajra, from those realms' nature-born realms, some drop-like surpassing cast. Upper samādhi lapses, "What also not" said. Only perception from above, dwelling without other. Immeasurable beings expand: called "nothing at all," called "slightly nothing." Good samādhi appearance must arise from good samādhi. Going increasingly below, emanation body smaller, light less. Denial sound: "nothing at all." Called ayatana by arisen from above appearance. Afflictions not manifestly moving, subtle latency.

[1141-1164]
These dwell in jewel-box samādhi. Like noble tenet arrangement from common vehicle. Connected with mind-entering existence beings. Now too, adventitious confusion arises from moving unproven space awareness. From Secret Essence: E ma ho from Sugata heart, self-thought karma emanation. From Condense: when conditions gather, karma confusion wheel arises. Like new birth, not new born. Obscuration together-born with awareness. Not confusion later—first pure, made clear by adventitious condition. Space expressing elements.

[1165-1188]
Below thirty-thousand yojanas, Mind-Activity sky: self-arising sound of immeasurable wheels meeting. Upper beings from calm-abiding, fallen below, consciousness to consciousness, beings expand greatly—consciousness without end, form object, wheel enters. Conceive self to consciousness, exceed end knowing, thing not exist. Arisen from these, form expands without end: consciousness without end ayatana. Life short, body small, light unclear, low samādhi—merit declined.

[1189-1210]
Below two thousand yojanas, Great Cloud sky: samādhi self-appearance arisen, pervaded by colored cloud heaps. Beings expand immeasurably: sky without end ayatana. Four formless: peak of existence eighty thousand great eons, nothing-at-all sixty thousand, consciousness forty thousand, sky without end twenty thousand. Body appearance not contradictory to formless: meditation gods dwell only as consciousness. Desire gods without flesh-blood, not conceiving consciousness to object.

[1211-1236]
Below, jewel ornament sky: five lights clearly appear, becoming one expanding consciousness mass. Immeasurable expand everywhere clearly—light mouth eye ear. Wind power moves, flies, hovers. Below-not, peak of form. Distinguish from limitless ayatana: this like picture or rainbow, outside light body. Body six thousand yojanas, life six thousand interval eons. Below, jewel deep blue: some latency consciousness fell, beings expand immeasurably—extremely seeing, joy when one sees. Body eight thousand, life eight thousand.

[1237-1260]
Below, jewel supreme beauty: excellent appearance, exceeding below. Body four thousand, life four thousand. Below, jewel hair fine: cloud without light, many beings expand—no sorrow to joy-bliss appearance. Body two thousand, life two interval eons. Below, jewel crystal house: not great beings, desire attachment not great. Life one interval, body one thousand.

[1261-1296]
Five place classes without affliction trace: five pure class gods, noble places. Above ordinary three places, below jewel supreme beauty spread: some not-great gods fell, called great fruit—great virtue fruit. Body five hundred, life five hundred. Below, jewel kali beautiful: great fruit gods cut in dot manner, merit born from accumulated merit. Body two hundred fifty, life that much. Below, jewel cloud thick: cloud without light from cut merit born. Slow gentle warm, cloud without sun. Body one hundred twenty-five, life that much.

[1297-1322]
Below, jewel light emit: virtue increase from cloud without. Body sixty-four, life that much. Below, jewel indra: measure without virtue. Body thirty-two, life that much. Some say measure without virtue above virtue increase. Below, jewel patangkaling: virtue small from above. Body sixteen, life that much. Below, jewel kekeru: light clear from above. Body eight, life eight. Below, jewel glory pile: measure without light. Body four, life four.

[1323-1350]
Below, jewel brave light: light small from above. Body two, life two. Below, jewel keruja: great Brahma beings. Brahma from desire fault. Body two and half, life that much. Below, jewel samika: some cut from great Brahma, Brahma before recites. Body one, life one. Below, jewel sikata: Brahma by cut from above, dwelling brahma-like in virtue. Body half, life half. Then desire realm: six god races.

[1351-1400]
First, below greatly expanded wish-fulfilling tree jewel: some Brahma expand, immeasurable beings—other emanation power do. Power over emanation appearance. Body two and half leagues, life thousand six hundred human years, own year sixteen thousand. Below, tree see beautiful: emanation joy, emanating hundred or thousand sons from body light. Body one and quarter leagues, life eight hundred human years, own year eight thousand.

[1401-1426]
Below, tree eye beautiful: joy possess from emanation joy, supreme joy bliss dharma. Body one league, life four hundred human years, own year four thousand. Below, tree mind change: 'Thab-bral from above fallen, asuras and conflict free. Body four-three leagues, life two hundred human years, own year two thousand. Below, tree completely-surrounded decorated ground: limit-without fallen beings expand thirty-three—elephant great steadfast, gold heads thirty-two, turquoise head one, powers thirty-three. Body four portion two leagues, life hundred human years, own year thousand.
