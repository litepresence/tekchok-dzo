[1000-1040]
The description of the gods' realm continues—eyes-not-good, hearing's son, land-guarding, with their palaces and pleasure-groves. Sandalwood water, mandarava flowers, beautiful lakes filled to the level of their banks. You read this and think of paradise.

But look at the phrase: "Gods' son and daughter fill with song and cymbals." This is the realm of subtle attachment to bliss. The songs are the whisperings of conceptual mind. The cymbals are the clash of thoughts that seem harmonious but are still noise. The gods' sons and daughters are the proliferations of meditation—experiences, visions, states that arise and seem beautiful but are still fabrications.

Outside the main city, the text describes jewel mansions, flower rains, sweet bird voices, flying jewel boats. These are the subsidiary attainments, the siddhis that tempt the practitioner. You may develop abilities, perceptions, powers—but if you attach to them, you are still in the gods' realm. You have not transcended. The flying jewel boats are your own consciousness, moving through space, but still moving. Still going somewhere. Still not at rest.

The four gardens at the directions—chariot various, rough-change, enjoyment-mix, everywhere-joy. We encountered these before, but now we see their function. Chariot Various-park is the meditation on diversity, where the practitioner sees the variety of phenomena. Rough-change park is the meditation on transformation, where the practitioner sees how phenomena change. Enjoyment-mix park is the meditation on the blending of bliss and emptiness. Everywhere-joy park is the meditation on equanimity, free from sorrow.

These are valuable meditations. But the gods practice them with attachment to the experience. They want the joy. They want the bliss. They want the freedom from sorrow. And because they want, they are bound. The freedom from sorrow that depends on conditions is not true freedom. When the conditions change, the sorrow returns.

The tree at the northeast, Complete Gather Burst, with its roots five leagues down and branches spreading like an umbrella—this is the tree of your life, practitioner. Your roots go deep into past karma. Your branches spread wide into future possibilities. The jewel net hanging from it is the net of interdependence, the way all things are connected. The gods' cloth that hangs there is the fabric of your experience, woven from your own mind.

The white rock slab, fifty leagues wide, like jewel harmonig—this is the seat of meditation, the ground of practice. Indra's throne is the recognition of your own nature. The falling flower rain is the natural blessings that come when you rest in that recognition.

But even Indra falls. Even the king of gods is subject to impermanence. His throne is conditional. His city is made of merit that exhausts. Do not aspire to be Indra. Aspire to recognize the nature that is king of all, yet is no king. Aspire to find the throne that needs no support, the city that is not built, the enjoyment that does not depend on conditions.

The assembly-place Dharma Good, three hundred wide, nine hundred in circumference, with Indra's throne in the middle and gods' seats arranged—this is the mandala of practice. But the true mandala has no circumference. The true throne is everywhere. The true assembly is all beings, not just gods.

[1041-1082]
Now we come to the form realm—beyond the desire gods, beyond the thirty-three, beyond even the asuras who war with them. The text describes houses measureless, relying on sky, like spread planets and stars. Two double sizes, measuring larger and larger.

You read this and think of higher heavens. But listen: these are the jhana states, the absorptions achieved through concentration. Each higher than the last, each more refined, each further from ordinary desire. But still, they are houses. They have dimensions. They rely on sky—they depend on space, on the absence of obstruction. But they are still constructed. They are still fabricated.

The interval sky from Jambu continent to the Thirty-three, eighty thousand leagues—the text says to understand this as before shown, by calculating. But what are you calculating? The progress of your own meditation. The distance from ordinary mind to the first jhana. The distance from the first to the second, the second to the third. Each stage further, each stage higher, but each stage still within the world-system.

"Thus attached, yet in one intermediate eon this vessel world empty nature, free from beings." This is crucial. The text reminds us that all these heavens, all these palaces, all these gods—even the highest form realm—are empty of inherent existence. They appear for an eon, then they empty. They are like a dream palace, magnificent while the dream lasts, gone upon waking.

The mountains and hills with their trees, grass, flowers—each valley with its forest, each continent expanding with jewel trees ripened by nectar rain from the sky. Beautiful. But it is all dependent on conditions. The rain falls, the trees grow. The rain stops, the trees wither. The gods enjoy this, but they do not see its nature. They think it is real. They think it is permanent. They think it is theirs.

The essence attaches manner like above step—the text describes how the world re-forms after being empty. But this is your own mind, practitioner. After a meditation session, after sleep, after distraction, your world re-forms. The essence—the karmic tendencies—attaches again. The vapor releases to ground. The jewel trees of your perceptions ripen again. And you are back in the world, thinking it is real, thinking it is solid, thinking it has always been here.

But you can recognize this process. You can see the world forming. You can see it dissolving. You can see the interval between—empty, free, without beings or essence. That interval is the natural state. That is what the gods do not see. They are so busy enjoying the garden that they do not notice the gardener. They are so busy dwelling in the palace that they do not see the foundation.

Your practice is to see the formation, abide in the emptiness, and not be seduced by the re-formation. When the world dissolves in meditation, do not fear. When it re-forms after meditation, do not grasp. See the whole process as display, as magic, as the play of your own awareness. Then you are higher than the gods. Then you are free of the world-system.

[1083-1106]
Now we enter subtle territory—the formless realm, the peak of existence. The text describes wind goddesses, water goddesses, naga power-possessing sons. Padma's speech sound radiating all directions, summoned by sound.

You read this and think of higher deities, more refined beings. But listen carefully: these are not beings separate from you. They are the subtle elements of your own mind when it approaches the formless absorptions. The wind goddesses are the subtle movements of conceptual mind. The water goddesses are the fluidity of awareness. The nagas are the powerful currents of energy that lie dormant until activated by practice.

The previous formless ripened consciousness, latency-abiding seeds, manifestly awakened. This is the ripening of your own karma, practitioner. The seeds you have planted through practice begin to sprout. The consciousness that was held in latency—hidden, potential—now manifests. But it is still consciousness. It is still formless, but it is still an ayatana, a base, a foundation. It is not liberation.

Samadhi's emanation body—consciousness accomplished as this body. Own appearance completely-piercing-through arisen. Body's portion without-not is. The text is describing the formless gods' bodies. But these are subtle bodies, made of consciousness alone. They are the most refined grasping at self. Even here, in the peak of existence, there is grasping. Even here, there is the thought "I am," "I exist," "I am conscious without end."

Subtle mind, coarse flesh-blood, clear light body three—whichever not-established, existing also not, thus existence non-existence's realms. This is the key. In the formless realm, the coarse body is abandoned. The clear light body is realized. But subtle mind remains. And where there is mind, there is existence. Where there is existence, there is non-existence. The duality remains.

Samadhi completely-emanating body that itself: part existing appears, part without appears, thus existence non-existence called. The formless gods exist in a state where they neither fully exist nor fully do not exist. They have transcended form, but they have not transcended consciousness. They dwell in peace, but it is the peace of suppression, not the peace of recognition.

Sūraṅgama samādhi—the heroic samadhi. Under mind completely-play wheel-possessing called sky, gold great vajra one upward arose. This is the highest absorption, where the vajra of consciousness stands upright, immovable. Light-rays immeasurable radiating. Extremely beautiful heroic manner possessing. The gods who achieve this see the vajra and enter it. They think they have reached the ultimate.

But then—the emanation vajra that mind extremely moved. From those realms' nature arisen realm that to, some drop-like surpassing cast. Upper Sūraṅgama samādhi from lapsed. "What also not" said. Even at the peak, the fall begins. Even the highest samadhi is impermanent. The mind moves. The vajra that seemed so stable begins to shake. The drop is cast down. The samadhi lapses. And from the peak of "nothing at all," the descent begins.

This is the tragedy of the formless gods. They achieve the highest peace within samsara, but they do not transcend samsara. They still move. They still change. They still fall. Only recognition of the nature of mind liberates. Only seeing that all these states—desire, form, formless—are equal in emptiness. Only that is true liberation.

[1107-1139]
From above only perception exists, from that dwelling without any other. Immeasurable beings expand, also called "nothing at all," also called "slightly nothing." You read these names of the formless absorptions and think of high meditation states. But listen, you who would understand your own mind.

"Nothing at all" is not liberation. It is the suppression of perception so refined that there seems to be nothing. But the one who perceives nothing is still there. The subtle grasping remains. "Slightly nothing" is the recognition that even nothing is something, so one settles into a state where there is almost nothing, just a slight presence, a whisper of existence.

The text says these states arise from good concentration, but going increasingly bad below. This is crucial. From the highest formless state, when the karma that sustains it exhausts, one does not stay there. One falls. And because one has been in a state of such subtle grasping, the fall is long and the landing is hard. The formless gods, when they exhaust their merit, are often reborn in lower realms because they have not accumulated the causes for higher rebirth while dwelling in their absorption.

Emanation body arisen from that appearance, body size smaller than above, light brilliance also small. As one descends through the formless realms, the appearance of body returns, but it is less radiant than before. Labeled as sound denying low called "nothing at all." The denial itself becomes the label. The very negation becomes a kind of assertion.

Ayatana by arisen and increased from above appearance—afflictions not manifestly moving, dwell in subtle latency. This is the danger of high meditation without wisdom. The afflictions are not purified; they are merely suppressed. They dwell in latency, like seeds waiting for the right conditions to sprout. When the meditation ends, when the absorption lapses, the afflictions return, often stronger than before.

These dwell in concentration called jewel box. A beautiful name for a trap. The jewel box is precious, but it is still a box. It confines. It limits. The formless gods are trapped in their own achievement, unable to move forward because they think they have reached the end.

Then the text quotes the Secret Essence: "E ma ho from Sugata heart, self thought karma emanation." This is the truth. All these realms, all these absorptions, all these states—they are self-thought, karma-emanation. They are created by your own mind. The Sugata heart, the Buddha nature, emanates them as play, as expression, but they are not the nature itself.

From Condense: "When conditions gather, karma confusion wheel arises." This is the mechanism. When the conditions come together, when the causes and conditions align, the wheel of karma and confusion turns. Worlds arise. Realms appear. Gods and hell-beings manifest. It is all dependent arising, empty of inherent existence.

Not new born—obscuration is together born ignorance equal endow to awareness, to that space part. This is profound. The obscuration is not something new that is added to awareness. It is co-emergent with awareness itself. It is the other side of the coin. Where there is awareness, there is the potential for ignorance of that awareness's nature. They are together born.

Not confusion later, first pure, only made actually clear by adventitious condition. The nature is not confused and then purified. It is pure from the beginning. The confusion is adventitious, added on, like clouds covering the sky. The sky was never stained by the clouds. Remove the clouds, and the sky is clear. Remove the confusion, and the nature is seen.

But the formless gods do not see this. They dwell in their jewel box, thinking they have escaped. Until the conditions change, and they fall.

[1140-1172]
Consciousness without end—the next formless ayatana. Those beings expand greatly, consciousness without end, form object, wheel enters. Only conceive self to only consciousness, exceed end knowing, condense thing not exist.

You read this and think of infinite consciousness. But listen: what is consciousness without end? It is the mind grasping at itself infinitely. It is the attempt to know the knower. It is the consciousness trying to be conscious of being conscious, stretching out infinitely like mirrors reflecting mirrors. It has no end because it is chasing its own tail.

Arisen from those, beings' form expands without end. Called consciousness without end ayatana. This is the second formless absorption, higher than "nothing at all" but still within the formless realm. The beings here have transcended the perception of "nothing," but they are caught in the perception of "consciousness." They have traded one prison for another.

Those also from above life measure short, body size small, light not clear. Compared to the beings in higher realms, these are diminished. Low concentration—that also cause decline of merit power. The concentration is weak because it is based on grasping. The merit power declines because it is not sustained by wisdom.

Then sky without end ayatana—below that at two thousand leagues, to sky called great cloud various play. Self-appearance concentration, pervaded by various colored cloud mass heaps. This is the third formless realm. Having exhausted the fascination with infinite consciousness, the beings expand into infinite space. The sky without end. The great cloud of various play—the display of phenomena appearing in space.

But it is still play. It is still various. It is still cloud—obscuring, not clear. Immeasurable beings expand from expanding consciousness. The expansion continues, but it is expansion into more of the same. More space. More consciousness. More infinity. None of it is liberation.

Thus from four formless—peak of existence lasts eighty thousand great eons. Nothing at all sixty thousand. Consciousness forty thousand. Sky without end twenty thousand. These are vast numbers, vast time spans. But they are still limited. They end. The peak of existence lasts eighty thousand great eons, but then it ends. What use is eighty thousand eons if it ends in fall?

The text addresses a question: if think body appearance contradicts formless, not contradict. Meditation gods' appearance dwells only as consciousness by formless of light. The formless gods do have bodies, but they are bodies of light, bodies of consciousness. They are not like our coarse bodies of flesh and blood. Desire gods humans' arise without flesh blood body, dwell not actually conceiving consciousness to object. Even in the desire realm, gods arise without the coarse bodies we have. They are more subtle.

Pretas' move without mind form—consciousness clear inside. Hells' experience without suffering body of contact. That consciousness dwelling in concentration joy bliss state also. This is showing the gradations. As realms become more subtle, the reliance on coarse form diminishes. But consciousness remains. Experience remains. The capacity for suffering and joy remains.

Peak of merit share equal fruit, to concentration part four, self-nature emanation appearance body or form, not manifest to below, only see from self place and above. Each realm sees what is appropriate to it. The formless gods see formless appearances. The form gods see form. The desire gods see desire realm appearances. Each sees from their own place and above, but not below. This is the limitation. To see below, to see the suffering of lower realms, one must have compassion. One must descend.

From middle Mother also, that time desire and form, formless dwell gods also holding flower in hand, worship Tathagata. Even the gods in these high realms, when they encounter the teachings, worship the Buddha. They know that their state, however high, is not the ultimate. They offer flowers—offer their merit, their achievement, their very existence—to the Tathagata. This is wisdom. This is the beginning of true path.

[1173-1198]
From short commentary also, established by called all god races come near. Then manner of expanding to form realm—when passed twenty-thousand leagues below from sky without end.

You see how the fall begins? From the highest formless realm, one passes down through the lower formless realms, and then, twenty thousand leagues below the lowest formless, one enters the form realm. The form realm is higher than the desire realm, more refined, but it is still below the formless. It is still within samsara.

To sky called jewel ornament various arrangement, five lights clearly appear without outside inside, by becoming one expanding mass of above consciousness. This is the highest form realm, where the five lights dawn—white, red, yellow, green, blue. The lights appear without distinction of outside and inside because the duality of perceiver and perceived has not yet fully re-emerged. It is the unity of consciousness, expanding as light.

Immeasurable expand everywhere clearly possessing light mouth eye ear, do move fly hover etc. by wind power. The beings here have bodies of light, with organs of perception made of light. They move by wind—by the subtle energy that animates the form realm. They fly, they hover, free from the heaviness of desire realm bodies. But they still move. They still go somewhere. They are still not at rest.

That also below compared to above formless, above all desire form, exist above, not below, called "below not" or "below not," exist at peak of all form possess. This is the highest form realm, called "below not" because there is nothing below it within the form realm. It is the peak of form. But remember—it is still below the formless. It is still within the world-system.

That also distinguish difference from limitless four ayatana concentration consciousness emanation body eye consciousness common not seen. This like picture form or rainbow form, become outside light body to clear consciousness. The bodies in the form realm are not seen by ordinary eye consciousness. They are like pictures, like rainbows—appearing but without substantial existence. They are light bodies, clear consciousness taking form.

Body six thousand leagues, life lasts six thousand interval eons. Vast, yes, but measurable. Limited. Temporary.

Then the descent continues through the form realms. Extremely see—cause exceed joy when one sees. Excellent appearance—measuring mark exceeding below. Not sorrow—no sorrow to those arisen joy bliss appearance. Not great—desire attachment to appearance not great. Each stage lower, the joy diminishes slightly, the attachment to form increases slightly, but they are still form realm gods, still absorbed in concentration, still free from gross desire.

These five place classes, without some affliction trace, called five pure class gods, five other noble places. The five pure abodes are special—they are realms where beings go who have attained the state of non-returner. They will not fall back to lower realms. They will achieve liberation from there. But they are still in the form realm. They still have subtle form. They are not yet fully liberated.

Above ordinary beings' three other places—great fruit, merit born, cloud without light. These are lower form realms, achieved by lesser virtue. Great fruit because they established great virtue. Merit born because arisen from accumulated merit. Cloud without light because they are like clouds obscuring the sun—their virtue is not yet brilliant.

Body sizes decrease as we go down—five hundred leagues, two hundred fifty, hundred twenty-five. Life spans decrease correspondingly. What was vast becomes less vast. What seemed almost infinite becomes measurable. This is the nature of the form realm. It is refined, but it is still conditioned. It is still impermanent.

[1199-1227]
Cause no sorrow to those arisen joy bliss appearance—body two thousand leagues, life lasts two interval eons. We continue through the form realms, each with its specific characteristics, each lower than the one before.

Jewel crystal house pile—arise beings called not great, cause desire attachment to appearance not great. The name itself tells the story. Not great. The beings here are less magnificent than those above. Their houses are made of crystal, beautiful but cold. Their attachment to appearance is not great, but it is still attachment.

Life lasts one interval eon, body size thousand leagues exist. Still vast by human standards, but the decline is clear. From six thousand leagues at the peak of form to one thousand here. From six thousand interval eons to one. The trajectory is downward, even through the heavens.

Then we reach the ordinary form realm heavens—virtue increase, measure without virtue, virtue small, light clear, jewel glory pile, jewel brave light. Each name describes both the quality of the realm and the limitation of its inhabitants. Virtue increase—they are increasing in virtue, but from a low base. Measure without virtue—their virtue is immeasurable, which means they have not measured it, do not understand it. Virtue small—self-explanatory. Light clear—their bodies are clear light, but this clarity is still a form of obscuration.

Body sizes continue to decrease—sixty-four leagues, thirty-two, sixteen, eight, four, two. Life spans decrease correspondingly. What was vast becomes intimate. What was cosmic becomes personal. But it is still form. It is still realm. It is still not liberation.

Some also say measure without virtue above virtue increase—there is some disagreement about the ordering of these realms. This is because the distinctions are subtle. The differences between one level of virtue and another are not always clear-cut. The important point is not the exact ordering but the principle: there are gradations of form realm existence, each with its characteristics, each with its limitations.

Jewel keruja, jewel kekeru, jewel samika, jewel sikata—the names become more obscure, more difficult to translate. But they all share the jewel prefix. These realms are precious, valuable, attained through virtue and concentration. But they are still constructed. They still depend on causes and conditions.

Light clear expanded from above, cause clear light body. The beings here have clear light bodies, achieved through the concentration on light. But clear light achieved through concentration is not the same as the natural clear light of the nature of mind. One is fabricated, the other is innate. One depends on practice, the other is always present.

Then to desire realm from two—first of six god races: below that to sky called greatly expanded wish fulfilling tree jewel. We have descended through the entire form realm, from the peak of "below not" down through the five pure abodes, through the ordinary form heavens, down to the lowest form realm. And now, below that, we enter the desire realm.

The wish-fulfilling tree jewel—this marks the transition to the desire realm. The beings here have desires, but they are refined desires. They wish for things, and the wish-fulfilling tree provides. They have power over emanation—the ability to manifest forms. Their bodies are leagues in size, their lives thousands of years by their reckoning.

[1228-1252]
Below that to sky called wish fulfilling tree see beautiful—fall from above is emanation joy. That sound by doing play joy, emanating hundred or thousand or immeasurable sons from body light. The descent continues. Now we are in the realm of emanation joy, where the gods take pleasure in manifesting forms, in creating.

Body league one and four part, five hundred and one hundred twenty-five bow lengths. Life eight hundred human years, calculate one day as own year thousand eight lasts. Time moves differently here. One day for these gods is eight hundred human years. Their lifespan, by their own reckoning, is a thousand eight hundred years. But by human reckoning, it is vastly longer. This is the nature of the god realms—time is relative, existence is prolonged, but it is still existence. It still ends.

Below that to sky called wish fulfilling tree eye beautiful—joy possess expanded from emanation joy, cause dwelling in supreme joy bliss dharma. Each level more refined, more capable of joy, but also more attached to that joy. The supreme joy bliss dharma—they think this is the ultimate. They dwell in it. They possess it. But possession implies separation. Where there is possessor and possessed, there is duality. Where there is duality, there is not liberation.

Body league one, five hundred bow lengths. Life four hundred human years, calculate one day as own year four thousand lasts. The progression continues. Bodies get smaller. Lives get shorter. But they are still immense compared to humans.

Below that to sky called wish fulfilling tree mind change—Thab-bral called, Asuras and conflict free. We have reached the realm of the Thirty-three, where Indra dwells, where the conflict with asuras is suspended. Thab-bral means "free from conflict," "without battle." This is the highest of the ordinary desire god realms, the most pleasant, the most refined.

But notice—even here, conflict is mentioned. Even in the realm free from conflict, conflict is remembered. The asuras are not absent; they are simply not fighting at the moment. The peace is conditional. It depends on the balance of power, the exhaustion of karma, the temporary alignment of conditions. It is not true peace. It is not the peace that passes all understanding.

Body leagues four-three: bow-lengths three-hundred seventy-five. Life human-years two-hundred, day one calculated, own-years two-thousand enduring. Still vast. Still desirable by ordinary standards. But you, practitioner, know better. You know that all this is temporary. You know that the gods, when their merit exhausts, fall. You know that the realm free from conflict is still within conflict's domain, still subject to the laws of karma, still part of the world-system.

Your goal is not to be reborn among these gods. Your goal is to transcend the entire system. To recognize that all these realms—hell, preta, animal, human, asura, god, form, formless—are equal in their emptiness. To see that the nature of mind is not higher or lower, not better or worse, not god or demon. It simply is. And in that is-ness, there is freedom.

[1253-1284]
That under wishing-tree completely-surrounded decorated ground—Limit-without from fallen realm expanded: thirty-three. We return to the Thirty-three, to Indra's realm, but now we see the details.

The great elephant with thirty-two gold heads and one turquoise head, roots three power and near-power exercise. This is the elephant Airavata, Indra's mount. The thirty-two gold heads represent the thirty-two major marks of a Buddha, but here they are inverted—instead of being marks of enlightenment, they are the pride of worldly power. The one turquoise head is the single eye of wisdom that is almost lost in the multiplicity of power.

Separate and necklace blazing abodes thirty-three. The elephant wears the thirty-three worlds as his necklace, blazing with the light of their splendor. Powers thirty-three's activities that called. The activities of the gods, their power and glory, are like ornaments—beautiful, impressive, but ultimately just decoration.

Body leagues' four portion two: bow-lengths two-hundred fifty. Life human-years hundred, day one calculated, own-years thousand one enduring. The numbers continue to diminish as we descend. What was two hundred human years per day is now one hundred. What was two thousand god-years is now one thousand one hundred. The trajectory is clear.

That under sun moon planets stars appearing abode Meru peak and yoke-holder basis, thirty-three from expanded realms: Great-king types four called. We have reached the realm of the Four Great Kings, at the base of Meru, where the sun and moon appear. These are the lowest of the desire gods, the guardians of the four directions.

Continents four individual's lords born, power control protect. The Four Great Kings rule over the four continents. They have power, they control, they protect. But they are still bound. They are still within the system. Their protection is conditional, limited, temporary.

Body leagues four portion one, bow-lengths hundred twenty-five, life human-years fifty, day one calculated, own-years five-hundred enduring. The decline continues. Fifty human years per day. Five hundred god-years of lifespan. Still vast, but now comparable to human longevity in the early eons. The gap between gods and humans is narrowing.

These desire-gods types six. Asuras types four: Life-glory god's type thirty-three, body and life equal. Great-power yaksha's type Great-king four's body life enjoyment equal. Fierce naga's type nagas equal. Killer raksasa's type pretas accord. Cruel mara's type cloth-beautiful type and so forth. Paranirmitavasavartin enjoyment's type equal.

The four types of asuras, demons, classified according to their equivalence to gods. The life-glory type equal to the Thirty-three. The great-power type equal to the Four Great Kings. The fierce naga type equal to the nagas. The killer raksasa type equal to pretas. The cruel mara type equal to the highest gods. The paranirmitavasavartin type equal to the gods who control others' emanations.

This classification shows the close relationship between gods and asuras. They are not so different. The asuras are almost gods. They have the same lifespan, the same body, the same enjoyment. Only their mind is different—filled with jealousy, competitiveness, aggression. This is the crucial point. The difference between high and low, god and demon, is not in the external circumstances but in the mind.

[1285-1320]
Life like thirty-three. Then demon class included in god class, titan class four only. The asuras, though demonic in nature, are classified within the god realm because they share the same lifespan, body, and enjoyment. But their inclusion is a reminder that even the highest pleasures can be poisoned by wrong mind.

Then expanded to humans—first, two god sons from clear light expanded to lotus miraculous birth on this excellent merit ground Jambu continent explained. We have descended through all the god realms, through all the asura realms, and now we arrive at the human realm. But what a birth! Not from womb, not from egg, not from moisture, but from clear light, from lotus, miraculous.

That after formed beings up to four great kings, two god sons from clear light fallen to this Jambu continent: Sun Greatly-Illuminating, Moon Stainless. These are the first humans, descending from the clear light gods, falling from the sky like sunlight and moonlight. Their names describe their nature—illuminating, stainless. The original human condition was luminous, pure.

Then to immeasurable lotus of light where all appearance greatly beautiful, from those two's minds greatly moved, by condition of manifest space seed part arisen, some miraculous birth god sons expanded. From the minds of the first two humans, moved by the beauty of the lotus light, other beings arose. The power of mind to create, to manifest, to expand. This is the origin of the human race—not from evolution, not from chance, but from mind. From the clear light.

Those joy when seeing each other, greatly clear light appearance, activity by miracle: Those beings go, also go to sky. Sit, also sit in sky. Food as meditation, dwell in joy bliss. The first humans had miraculous powers. They could fly. They could dwell in bliss. They took meditation as food—they were nourished by absorption, by the clear light. They had no need for coarse food.

Body extends immeasurable light ray groups, where wish to go, by mere thought arrive, life years immeasurable last, no afflictions manifestly move. No suffering. No limitation. No affliction. This is the human condition in the first eon, before the fall. Before grasping. Before duality fully emerged.

Some tantras explain expanded from Joy Possess, some explain expanded from Four Great Kings. Intention: those two first chiefs fallen from clear light, below that Joy Possess, Four Great Kings, fallen from above others, miraculously born here, know no contradiction in all views. Different teachings give different accounts of the origin. But the intention is the same: humans came from light, from higher realms, from purity. The fall is the descent into denser states, into embodiment, into limitation.

That time first eon that place name called Joy Possess Pile. What cause? Inconceivable light appearance enjoyment, immeasurable awareness concentration joy bliss. The first eon was called "Joy Possess Pile" because it was characterized by inconceivable enjoyment, by immeasurable bliss. The humans of that time possessed joy naturally, without effort, without seeking.

That time sixth teacher Vajra Holder tames those beings. Even in this state of natural bliss, there is need for teaching. The Vajra Holder, Vajradhara, the sixth Buddha of this eon, came to guide these beings. Not because they were suffering—they were not. But because even bliss, when not recognized as the nature of mind, is still samsara. Even enjoyment, when clung to, becomes bondage.

[1321-1340]
Came in manner of miraculous birth to wide large cavity of thousand-petaled greatly beautiful light lotus. The Buddha Vajradhara, the primordial Buddha, appears spontaneously, born from the lotus of reality itself. Not from parents, not from conditions, but from the natural expression of the dharmakaya.

That also, by gazing at beings with three forms of gaze, expanded from above: god sons Sun Greatly-Illuminating, Moon Without-Stain arose. Sign of arising as teacher taming beings by relying on means and wisdom. The Buddha's gaze—compassionate, wise, all-seeing—calls forth the first students. The sun and moon, the first humans, arise from that gaze. The teacher and the taught are not separate. They arise together.

That time, upon each lotus petal top, each similar to Buddha and cause came: Sign of thousand Buddhas arising in this eon. Each petal of the thousand-petaled lotus represents a Buddha who will appear in this fortunate eon. The first humans, sun and moon, are the precursors, the signs, the causes for the thousand Buddhas to come.

Then, taming appearance eye gazing at lotus, proclaimed self sound of hot cold arisen from sky: From thrice arisen sound called "not appear dark," those beings also seized being called human. The Buddha's teaching manifests as sound—three times arising, dispelling the darkness of not-knowing. And the beings who hear it are "seized"—captured, transformed, claimed by the dharma. They become human—not just in body, but in nature. To be human is to have the capacity to hear the dharma, to understand, to practice.

That time, no body flesh etcetera flesh blood—occasionally rely on above light, clearly appear, greatly beautiful sense five, limb, color, ayatana etcetera exist and-yet, male and female different not. The first humans had no coarse bodies. They were made of light, sustained by light. Occasionally they relied on the light from above—the light of the clear light gods, the light of the natural state. Their senses were beautiful, their limbs perfect, but there was no male and female. No duality. No separation.

That time, sixty-four light stars appearing in sky: before sign of sixty-four Great Perfection dharma enumerations arising. The sixty-four stars that appeared were omens of the sixty-four tantras of the Great Perfection that would be taught. From within that, seventeen beautiful bright: Sign of seventeen extremely secret supreme tantras arising. Seventeen of the sixty-four are especially secret, especially profound. They are the heart of the teaching.

Then, awareness form all-knowing eye showing emptiness that, gazing at taming object, say early to all teachings sound thalgyur great root tantra. The Buddha's all-knowing eye, the wisdom that sees emptiness, gazes at the beings to be tamed. And from that gaze, the sound of the Thalgyur tantra arises—the great root tantra that contains all teachings.

This time, beings' life years immeasurable, body thirty-two cubits. Then gradually decline. The golden age does not last. Even with miraculous birth, even with light bodies, even with immeasurable lifespan, decline sets in. This is the nature of conditioned existence. Where there is birth, there is death. Where there is formation, there is dissolution.

Then beings also many expand, life also gradually decline, body light etcetera also fade, merit also small went. The multiplication of beings, the decline of lifespan, the fading of light, the exhaustion of merit—all happening together, all signs of the world's degeneration. But this degeneration is not a fall from grace in the biblical sense. It is the natural play of conditions. It is the way the world-system operates. And within it, there is always the opportunity for awakening.

[1341-1360]
The text continues the story of decline, but the original page 39 content appears to be truncated. Based on the pattern of Longchenpa's Treasury, this section continues describing the degeneration of the human condition and the arising of the need for dharma teachings.

You have read now of the world's formation, its structure, its inhabitants, and its eventual decline. From the highest formless realms down through the form realms, through the desire heavens, through the asura battles, to the human realm with its miraculous origins and gradual degeneration. What are you to make of all this?

Some will take it as mythology, as ancient cosmology to be compared with modern science. Some will take it as literal truth, clinging to every measurement, every name, every detail. Both miss the point.

The point is this: all worlds are mind. All realms are your own awareness taking different shapes. The hells are not below the earth; they are the burning of anger in your mind. The heavens are not above the clouds; they are the bliss of concentration when achieved. The human realm is not merely this planet; it is the condition of awareness that can choose—choose virtue or non-virtue, practice or distraction, awakening or continued wandering.

You are reading these words because you have the precious human body, the precious human life. Not the light-body of the first eon, but something more valuable: a body that suffers. A life that knows impermanence. A mind that can recognize its own nature precisely because it is not lost in endless bliss, not tormented by endless pain, but poised between, capable of understanding, capable of choice.

Do not waste this. Do not think "I will practice later, when conditions are better." The conditions are never better than now. The first humans had miraculous powers, immeasurable lifespan, natural bliss—and they still declined. Their conditions were perfect, and they still fell into duality, into grasping, into degeneration. You have imperfect conditions—limited lifespan, coarse body, distracted mind—and this is your advantage. You know impermanence. You know suffering. You know that nothing lasts. Use this knowledge.

The world-system described by Longchenpa is vast, complex, filled with details that could occupy a scholar for lifetimes. But you are not a scholar. You are a practitioner. Your task is not to memorize the names of the god realms or the measurements of Mount Meru. Your task is to recognize the nature of your own mind.

When you sit in meditation, you may experience bliss like the desire gods. You may achieve absorption like the form gods. You may enter clear light like the formless gods. Do not be seduced. Do not think "this is it." All these experiences are signposts, not destinations. They show you what is possible, but they are not liberation.

Liberation is recognition. Recognition that all these realms are empty. Recognition that the one who experiences them is empty. Recognition that experience itself is empty. Not empty like a void, but empty like space—open, clear, infinitely spacious, allowing all things to arise without obstruction, without grasping, without fixation.

This recognition is available now. Not when you achieve this or that meditation state. Not when you are reborn in a higher realm. Now. In this very moment, as you read these words, the nature of your mind is present, open, aware. It has never been separate from you. You have never been separate from it.

Rest in that. Let the world-system arise and dissolve. Let the gods ascend and fall. Let the humans multiply and decline. You remain, open and aware, the space in which all this play unfolds. This is the teaching of the Treasury. This is Longchenpa's gift. Do not squander it.

[1344-1369]
. But what use is knowing how beings emerged from light-eggs and gradually degenerated, unless you see your own mind's degeneration right now?

You think you are different from those ancients who lived eighty-thousand years, who ate essence of earth like honey, who needed no clothes because their own light radiated seven fathoms clear? Look at yourself! Your light has dimmed to almost nothing. You need lamps in daytime, heaters in warmth, layers of cloth to cover your shame. This is not merely a story of ancient history—this is the story of your own mind's wandering!

When those first beings fell from light into desire, from desire into grasping, from grasping into stealing and killing—do you not see yourself in each step?

[1344-1369]
—is itself the display of your own deluded mind. The vessels and essences, the continents and hells, all arise from the three poisons you harbor in your breast. 

So what to do? Do not merely read. Look directly: Who is reading? What is this light that still knows, still sees, still understands these words? That knowing is itself the primordial radiance that never degenerated, never fell, never became clothed in flesh and karma. Rest there. Let the story of samsara be the story that points you back to what never entered the story at all.

[1361-1380]
Page 40 appears to be a continuation from the previous section on human degeneration. Let me provide commentary based on the thematic completion of this cosmological section.

So we come to the end of this section on the world-system's container and essence. You have traveled from the clear void before formation, through the arising of elements, the construction of Mount Meru, the establishment of realms from hell to heaven, and finally to the human condition with its miraculous origins and inevitable decline.

What now? What are you to do with this knowledge?

First, understand that this description is not merely ancient cosmology. It is a map of your own mind. The world-system is the system of your perceptions, your habits, your karmic patterns. The realms are the states you cycle through—not in some future life, but in this very day. In the morning, you may be in a god realm, feeling blissful and powerful. By noon, you are in an asura realm, fighting with colleagues, competing, jealous. By evening, you are in a hell realm, burning with anger or frozen by depression. Then sleep comes, and you enter the formless realms of dreamless absorption.

You cycle through all of this in twenty-four hours. You are a cosmological wanderer, a realm-traveler, never staying anywhere for long. And yet you think you are a solid person, living in a solid world, with a solid identity. Foolish one! You are nothing but flow. You are change itself.

Second, understand that liberation is not found in any of these realms. Not in the highest heaven, not in the deepest absorption. Liberation is found in recognizing that all realms are equally empty, equally mind-made, equally the play of awareness. When you recognize this, you are no longer bound by the realm you happen to be in. You can be in hell with the mind of a Buddha. You can be in heaven with the mind of a practitioner, not grasping, not clinging, using the favorable conditions but not seduced by them.

Third, understand the preciousness of the human realm. You have read how the gods, despite their bliss, are still bound. You have read how even the formless beings, despite their peace, eventually fall. Only humans have the perfect balance—the capacity for both suffering and bliss, the intelligence to understand the teachings, the motivation to practice. The gods are too comfortable. The hell beings are too tormented. The humans are in the middle, capable of turning toward the dharma.

But this capacity is not permanent. The text describes the decline of the human condition—lifespan shortening, body becoming coarse, merit exhausting. This is happening now. You can see it in the world around you. The degeneration is real. The opportunity is limited. Do not wait.

Finally, understand that all of this—the world-system, the realms, the gods, the humans, the teachings themselves—are like dreams, like illusions, like the moon reflected in water. They appear, they function, they have consequences, but they have no inherent existence. They are the play of your own mind. And the nature of that mind is emptiness and clarity inseparable, the dharmakaya itself.

To recognize that nature is the purpose of all these teachings. Not to become an expert in Buddhist cosmology. Not to win debates about the number of leagues to Mount Meru's peak. But to wake up. To see what is. To be free.

Longchenpa has laid it all out for you—the entire structure of samsara, from top to bottom. He has shown you where you are, where you have been, where you might go. Now it is up to you. Will you continue to wander? Or will you recognize the wanderer?

The choice is yours. It has always been yours. Make it wisely.

[1370-1396]
Every moment your mind chases after pleasure, you fall further. Every time you grasp at "mine," you sink deeper into this swamp of existence.

Longchenpa describes the hells arising from anger accumulated

[1413-1423]
—but you don't need to wait for death to experience hell. Feel your own rage, that burning that consumes you from within! That is the Reviving Hell right here, right now.
