[999-1005] You think these four kings are something special? I've seen better security watching a yak hair tent in a blizzard. They guard the directions like a frozen butter lamp sputtering at midnight—present but not exactly illuminating much. The text says they dwell with their retinues, but you know what? So does a hermit with his fleas. Don't get caught up in the hierarchy. Whether you're a world-protector or a beggar on the road, you're still looking for the same thing—recognition of what was never lost.

[1019-1035] Thirty-three gods on Meru, and every one of them thinks their palace is special. I once tried to build a meditation hut that fancy. Took three days. Leaked on the fourth. Indra's palace with its crystal foundations—sure, it's beautiful. But beauty is just mind's projection, like seeing a face in the frost on your tent wall. You think the gods are happy up there? I've met happier beggars. The four gardens sound lovely, all mandara flowers and sandalwood pools. But I've drunk from a mountain stream that tasted sweeter than any celestial nectar. Don't chase their paradise. Your own mind is the only palace that doesn't crumble.

[1042-1067] That assembly-place called Dharma Good—sounds impressive, doesn't it? Like some grand philosophical gathering. But I've seen dharma discussions in barns that cut deeper than any celestial symposium. The gods sit on their thrones discussing virtue while their realm is still within samsara's shopping district. They're wealthy shoppers in a burning mall. You want to know the real dharma assembly? Look at your own mind in the morning before thoughts start chattering. That's the only gathering worth attending.

[1068-1090] Now we get to the form realm. The gods up here are subtler, more refined, like mist instead of rain. They think they've escaped the coarse desires of lower realms. But refined attachment is still attachment. I've known meditators who spent years cultivating these states, thinking they were getting somewhere. It's like polishing a frozen butter lamp—you can make it shine, but it still won't give real warmth. The form realm gods have beautiful bodies made of light. So what? I've seen corpses that taught me more about reality than any radiant deity.

[1091-1106] Formless realm—now this is where the really subtle confusion happens. No body, no location, just mind dwelling on infinite space or consciousness. Sounds advanced, doesn't it? Like climbing to the top of a mountain only to find another mountain. I spent a winter thinking I understood this. Turns out I was just good at sitting still. Surangama samadhi—heroic progress, they call it. But heroic progress toward what? You're already there, you fool! While you're busy climbing through these refined states, the nature of mind is staring you in the face like a butter lamp you keep trying to light that's already burning. Stop looking up. Look here.
