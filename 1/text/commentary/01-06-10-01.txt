reveal the three kayas' display! Unelaborate shows nirmanakaya field—aggregates, elements, sense bases emptied! Very unelaborate shows sambhogakaya field—mind's coming and going realized as non-existent! Special unelaborate gives dharmakaya prophecy—samsara and nirvana's attachment, subtle knowledge obscuration purified!

Like a knot untying itself! Like ice melting in the sun! Effortless self-liberation!

Second, self-face difference extensively explained! Four empowerments elaborated! Elaborate-with-elaborate—drink water, outer! Elaborate-without-elaborate—enter mandala, deity shown, name given! Elaborate-with-very-elaborate—sravaka vow, nine complete, breath held! Elaborate-with-special-elaborate—vase certain, body seal perfect!

Progressive like grades in school! Each builds the foundation for the next! You drink, you enter, you receive—each empowerment opens what was closed!

Also vase certain explained! Palace relied upon, deity clear! Student body becomes deity, four elements purified! Substance sun-moon given, consort given, practice certain, sign-meaning-word given!

Like receiving a key to a locked treasure house! Like being given the crown of a king! Receiving opens recognition!

Emaho! The four gates to liberation!

Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: The four unelaborates are not stages to climb but aspects to recognize. Like a jewel showing four faces—each face complete, yet the jewel is one. Don't seek the fourth while ignoring the first. Each contains all.

[8875-8885]
Voice 20 proclaims: The unelaborate of unelaborate is the ground itself—prior to elaboration, naturally pure. Like space before the wind stirs. The unelaborate without elaboration is the path—recognition of that purity. Like remembering you are dreaming while in the dream.

[8880-8890]
This old practitioner once sought the special unelaborate while neglecting the ordinary. He wanted extraordinary experiences, high teachings, secret transmissions. Then his teacher showed him a cup of tea. "The special is hidden in the ordinary." The four unelaborates are one unelaborate showing four ways.

[8885-8895]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The unelaborate is not achieved through effort. It is revealed through recognition. Like cleaning a mirror—the reflection doesn't arrive; it is revealed. The four empowerments are four ways of cleaning, four ways of revealing what was never stained.

[8890-8900]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals: The four elaborate empowerments correspond to the four unelaborates like shadow to form. They are not opposites but complements. The elaborate points to the unelaborate like a finger points to the moon. Don't worship the finger.

[8895-8905]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who collect empowerments like stamps! Those who count initiations like coins! They miss the point entirely. One empowerment fully received is worth more than a hundred taken casually. The unelaborate is not found in numbers but in recognition.

[8900-8910]
Between elaboration and non-elaboration, the vast middle way opens. The elaborate is not wrong; the unelaborate is not right. They are two aspects of one reality, like two wings of one bird. Fly with both, or don't fly at all.

[8905-8915]
This old hermit received many empowerments in his youth. He kept lists, counted blessings, treasured his certificates. Then one day he lost them all in a fire. At first he wept. Then he laughed—what was lost? Paper. What remained? Recognition. The true empowerment cannot be burned.

[8910-8920]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The four unelaborate empowerments are the essence of all empowerments. They show that what is to be received is already present, what is to be opened is never closed, what is to be purified was never stained.

[8915-8925]
Voice 20 proclaims: Emaho! The four gates lead to the same palace! The four keys open the same treasure! Don't seek variety; seek depth. One gate fully entered reveals all gates. One key fully turned opens all locks.

[8920-8930]
This old practitioner offers final teaching: The unelaborate is your own face. The empowerment is self-empowerment. The teacher points to what you already are. The ritual is celebration, not creation. Rest in that, and all empowerments are complete.

[8925-8935]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The elaborate shows the unelaborate. The unelaborate was never hidden. The seeker seeks what has never been lost. This is the great joke of the path—and the great liberation.
