Hence. The structure. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[10786-10790]
This fool. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[10790-10794]
The answer comes like lightning: because the essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in samsara as real entities. From the power of spontaneous presence as merely the play of the path, appearing like that does not contradict primordial purity.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Just as when going to sleep, though dreams do not exist in the own-face of awareness, appearances of horses and oxen appearing to the dreamer does not contradict the empty nature of sleep. The dreamer is never truly bound by the dream.

[10794-10800]
Between samsara and nirvana, the vast middle way opens like the sky at dawn. Conventional appearance shows spontaneous presence with all its qualities; ultimate emptiness reveals primordial purity. These are not two substances but two aspects of one non-dual reality. Like a coin with two faces—you cannot have the gold without both sides.

[10798-10808]
Stop searching. Start seeing. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[10800-10808]
Voice 20 proclaims: Those are the dispute-answers establishing non-duality! From Klongdrukpa: Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature (rang bzhin). Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva, listen well. Because the nature (rang bzhin) is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing in the field. The bodhisattva himself asked: If the nature (rang bzhin) itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete, are these sentient beings reasonably self-liberated without effort?

[10808-10814]
Slash through hesitation. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[10815-10824]
Consequently. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[10820-10830]
From the tantra: Because there are no words by which to express the ultimate, being free from words of expression and sound entirely, because the essence of anything is not established as real, words are free from harming this ultimate nature. Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Sentient beings, from the object of self-grasping mind alone, because variety, recollection, and thought do not cease in delusion, words do not harm the essence—there is no distinction in the nature (rang bzhin).

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Because of the term ultimate and conventional distinction.

[10830-10848]
This old hermit sits in meditation as the sun rises. Words cannot capture this moment. The distinction between ultimate and conventional is itself conventional. The ultimate has no opposite. Primordial purity is not the negation of impurity; spontaneous presence is not the affirmation of existence. They are the natural state, beyond affirmation and negation. The seven bases debate like children arguing about the color of air. The eighth resolution is the laughter of recognition.

[10830-10848]
Between words and silence, the vast middle way opens. The Teacher's response dissolves the debate by showing that the very terms of the dispute belong to conventional designation. Ultimate reality cannot be expressed in words, yet words are used to point. The essence is not established as real, so words cannot harm it. The nature spontaneously displays, so words cannot capture it. This is the secret of the non-dual basis—beyond the reach of logical analysis, yet immediately present to direct recognition.

[10840-10855]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Stop debating and LOOK! The non-dual basis is not a conclusion to reach but a recognition to have. All this analysis is preparation. The meal is recognition. Stop preparing and eat!

[10850-10865]
Thus established. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[10855-10865]
This old hermit offers final teaching: All words are now exhausted. All positions abandoned. The non-dual basis stands revealed—not as a new doctrine but as your own face. Look and recognize.
