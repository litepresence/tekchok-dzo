You are not a thing to be compared to a conch shell. The base is not something "like" something else. The metaphor points, but do not mistake the finger for the moon. The base essence is primordially pure. This means it has always been pure. Not "became" pure. Not "will be" pure. Always. Like the sky has always been blue, even when clouds cover it.

The youth vase body—you imagine some beautiful young deity, radiant and perfect. Foolish! The youth vase body is your own nature, unobscured by age or decay, because it was never born. It abides in the actual state, which is not a place. It is the state of actuality itself. Empty, yes—empty of thingness, empty of marks. But not empty of awareness. Not empty of the subtle resonance that is your own primordial wisdom.

But they are not three things. They are three aspects of one thing, like a jewel has color, shape, and value. You cannot have one without the others. The essence is empty, yet nature is clear. How? Look at space—empty, yet it appears clear. The compassion is the unce arising of awareness-knowing, wisdom expanding.

, he quotes the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra. Realize buddha not-arisen. Not-realize sentient-being not-arisen earlier front in. Awareness self-arisen wisdom base from not-moved. You think Buddha is something to become, sentient being is something to stop being. But neither has ever arisen. Where is the Buddha you will become? Where is the sentient being you are now? They are concepts, labels, fingers pointing at the moon. And awareness—self-arisen wisdom—it has never moved from the base. You think you have wandered through samsara for eons, but the awareness that knows that wandering has never moved an inch.

Not-confused buddha great as abide, essence body not-cease abide, essence not-change, method secret, unmoved, not-move, not-shaken. You hear "not-move" and you think you must freeze, hold still, become like a rock. No! Unmoved means not moved by conditions. The essence does not change when the weather changes. The method is secret—not hidden from you, but secret because it cannot be spoken. It can only be recognized.

So look at your own mind. Is it not like the youth vase body—unborn, undying, naturally radiant? Do not look elsewhere. Do not think you will find it in some future practice, some future realization. It is here. It has always been here. The only question is: do you recognize it?

I need to practice more, understand more, realize more." Foolish! The completion is not something you achieve. It is the nature of things as they already are. Every appearance is complete. Every moment of wisdom is complete. The body that you have right now—do you think it needs to become some rainbow body to be complete? It is already the mature abiding of the kayas. You just do not see it.

You think the kayas are somewhere else, in some pure land, wearing ornaments of gold and jewels. But the actual state appears without obscuration right here. The essence is great, and it abides as the body—not "as" the body in the sense of becoming the body, but the body itself is the display of that essence. And in that display, there is no abiding in the mouth, eye, ear, desire. It is empty, yet not abiding in emptiness. Like a bird flying through the sky—it does not abide anywhere, yet it flies.

All arise from emptiness, yet they are not mixed—they appear completely, purely. Confusion and purity do not cease—they are both great displays of the same nature.

So stop trying to clear the darkness. Stop trying to make things cease. Let appearances arise. Let them be not-mixed yet completely apparent. Let them pervade and gather into one. This is the great play of your own nature. Can you just let it be? That is the only practice. That is the only completion.

The actual state itself.

So stop trying to separate essence from nature from compassion. Stop trying to find the base as a thing. It is the actual-state. It is what is actually happening right now, without your concepts about it. Can you see it? Can you rest in it? That is the only question worth asking.

The entity empty-portion reversed! Look at what is not: Not awareness! Not non-awareness! Not buddha! Not sentient being! Not samsara! Not transcended! Not light! Not color! Not body! Not primordial wisdom! Not ground! Not path! Not result!

This is not nihilism—this is the great freedom from all conceptual constructs! Like the sky cannot be stained by clouds, your nature cannot be limited by any quality!

No confusion! No liberation! No bondage! These are mere labels applied to what has always been free!

The nature appearance-portion reversed! Whatever appears, its essence is emptiness. Whatever is empty, its nature is appearance. Not two, not one—beyond the mind that divides!

You seek to establish what cannot be established! You seek to characterize what has no characteristics! Stop looking with the mind that creates distinctions! The primordially pure has no direction, no limit, no center!

This is the view that destroys all views! The meditation that transcends all meditation! The conduct that is beyond conduct! The result that was never apart from the ground!

Like searching for the edge of space—you will search forever and find nothing to find!

Rest in what cannot be described, what cannot be thought, what cannot be meditated!

Emaho! The great reversal of all concepts!

Listen well, dear one! From the Mu-tig-phreng-ba (Pearl Garland): the nature dwells in its own essence—to this Buddha and sentient beings are not different, non-recognition and confusion are not different, mind and mental factors do not separately exist. Look here! Enemy and friend are not different, relatives and non-relatives are not different. Affliction and self-grasping are not different!

Understand this: going and coming are not different, dharma and non-dharma do not appear different, method and wisdom themselves are not different. Aggregate and element are not different, object and grasped object are not different. Sense-power and object are not different, grasping and grasped are not different!

Form and primordial-wisdom are not different, knower and knowable have no master. Light and color do not exist separately, sound and smell are beyond distinction. Desire and attachment are not different, space and palace are not different, deity and offering are beyond all duality!

Free from words and letters, cannot be determined by expression, free from all superimposed terms. Not grasping or grasped conceptualization. Buddha not different from sentient beings, dharma not different from non-dharma concepts—what and what and what also not! This is called the essence of non-differentiation.

From the Yi-ge-med-pa (Without Letters): To me, birth and death are not a cause, ceasing not—dharma complete! To me, outer and inner are not a cause, clear—dharma complete! To me, empty and existent are not a cause, appearing—dharma complete!

To me, perceivable object is not a cause, seeing—dharma complete! To me, body and mind are not a cause, self-appearing—dharma complete! To me, self and other are not a cause, awareness-dharmas five—complete! To me, action's cause is not a cause, great meditation—complete! To me, gone object is not a cause, self-appearing object—complete! To me, direction and kind are not a cause, secret primordial-wisdom—complete! To me, appearing and ceasing are not a cause, space-dharmas three—complete!

"I" does not exist earlier—yet the base thus abides. Called primordially pure great. Essence, nature, compassion, form—three aspects of one abiding. Ignorance is called, but the name has no existence. One and two—numbers do not apply. Examine existence and non-existence—neither is established. Where not divided from dharma-nature, wisdom only also does not accomplish. Words do not exist—speech accomplishes nothing. At the end, not abiding, self-aware pure. Hold speech, name, end—they exhaust. No cause, no condition, no number—at that, object and subject do not exist. Characteristics divide nowhere. Subject coarse exhausts. Primordially not existing—pure, pure.

So let the colors be. Let the lights be. They are your own display, self-dissolving, self-pure. Do not grasp at them. Do not chase them. Rest in the youth vase body, the actual state, and let appearances be the ornament of your own nature.
