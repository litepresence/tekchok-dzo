Hence. The structure...

[10786-10790]
This fool...

[10790-10794]
The answer comes like lightning: because the essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in samsara as real entities. From the power of spontaneous presence as merely the play of the path, appearing like that does not contradict primordial purity. Just as when going to sleep, though dreams do not exist in the own-face of awareness, appearances of horses and oxen appearing to the dreamer does not contradict the empty nature of sleep. The dreamer is never truly bound by the dream.

[10794-10800]
Between samsara and nirvana, the vast middle way opens like the sky at dawn. Conventional appearance shows spontaneous presence with all its qualities; ultimate emptiness reveals primordial purity. These are not two substances but two aspects of one non-dual reality. Like a coin with two faces—you cannot have the gold without both sides.

[10798-10808]
Stop searching. Start seeing.

[10800-10808]
Voice 20 proclaims: Those are the dispute-answers establishing non-duality! From Klongdrukpa: Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature. Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva, listen well. Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing in the field. The bodhisattva himself asked: If the nature itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete, are these sentient beings reasonably self-liberated without effort?

[10808-10814]
Slash through hesitation.

[10815-10824]
Consequently...

[10820-10830]
From the tantra: Because there are no words by which to express the ultimate, being free from words of expression and sound entirely, because the essence of anything is not established as real, words are free from harming this ultimate nature. Sentient beings, from the object of self-grasping mind alone, because variety, recollection, and thought do not cease in delusion, words do not harm the essence—there is no distinction in the nature. Because of the term ultimate and conventional distinction.

[10830-10848]
This old hermit sits in meditation as the sun rises. Words cannot capture this moment. The distinction between ultimate and conventional is itself conventional. The ultimate has no opposite. Primordial purity is not the negation of impurity; spontaneous presence is not the affirmation of existence. They are the natural state, beyond affirmation and negation. The seven bases debate like children arguing about the color of air. The eighth resolution is the laughter of recognition.

[10830-10848]
Between words and silence, the vast middle way opens. The Teacher's response dissolves the debate by showing that the very terms of the dispute belong to conventional designation. Ultimate reality cannot be expressed in words, yet words are used to point. The essence is not established as real, so words cannot harm it. The nature spontaneously displays, so words cannot capture it. This is the secret of the non-dual basis—beyond the reach of logical analysis, yet immediately present to direct recognition.

[10840-10855]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Stop debating and LOOK! The non-dual basis is not a conclusion to reach but a recognition to have. All this analysis is preparation. The meal is recognition. Stop preparing and eat!

[10850-10865]
Thus established...

[10855-10865]
This old hermit offers final teaching: All words are now exhausted. All positions abandoned. The non-dual basis stands revealed—not as a new doctrine but as your own face. Look and recognize.
