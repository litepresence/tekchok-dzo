! The stains that cling to your body, speech, mind, and consciousness—these are not your true nature! Like dust settling on a mirror, they obscure but do not change what is already perfect and pure.

The four empowerments are the waters that wash these stains away. Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each carries four stains, sixteen in total. But look deeper! These sixteen multiply through elaboration-with and elaboration-without, sign and meaning, until thirty-two obscurations stand purified. Like a lotus rising through muddy water, you emerge unstained!

Lines

[8951-8958]
reveal the eightfold path of purification: elaboration-with sign and meaning, elaboration-without sign and meaning, very elaboration-without, and extremely elaboration-without. Each doorway leads to the same primordial purity. Like rivers flowing to the ocean—all paths converge in realization!

The mind that thinks virtue and non-virtue, prophecy and non-prophecy, grasping and rejecting—all these thoughts are the very stains themselves! But who is the thinker? Search and you will find only empty space. Like searching for the color of the sky—you look everywhere and find nothing to grasp!

Doubt is the demon that binds you. Analysis is the net that ensnares you. Release the mind that holds objects variously! Let thoughts arise and dissolve like clouds in the vast sky of awareness. The thirty-two stains purify not through effort but through recognition—seeing their true nature as emptiness!

Emaho! The stains were never real!

[8973-8986]
Four empowerments divide method and prajna two-by-two, eight purifications! Body's elements particular: earth and so on, each with four—earth's earth and so on—sixteen. Hot and cold two divisions make sixty-four, sign-meaning division's sixty-four empowerments purify! Also four elements each well divided: sixty-four. Pervading element general body and self-characteristic held actual body two divisions—earth has different bodies hundred twenty-eight. Similarly divided, water, fire, wind each hundred twenty-eight, three sets, combined five hundred twelve bodies ripen!

[8987-8997]
Thus outer body ripens, inner afflictions too: desire—looking, laughing, holding, embracing—four, each element's body four-by-four, sixteen. Delusion—dulled unknowing, obscured, intoxicated, greatly non-recognition mixed—four divided into four, sixteen. Hatred—hating, great hating, greatly hating... Do you see? Five hundred twelve bodies without, sixteen afflictions within—all from element-play!

Emaho! Your confusion is element-dance!

[8965-8972]
Thus. We proceed...

[8968-8978]
Voice 20 proclaims: The sixteen body stains, sixteen speech stains—each corresponds to an empowerment that purifies. Like poison and antidote paired from the first. The empowerment doesn't create purity; it reveals what obscuration hid.

[8975-8985]
This fool...

[8980-8990]
Recognition is immediate.

[8985-8995]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[8990-9000]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who count their stains like beads on a mala! Those who catalog obscurations like librarians! They miss the point. One stain recognized is all stains purified. Don't multiply what needs to be dissolved.

[8995-9005]
Between purity and impurity, the vast middle way opens. The stains appear impure; their nature is pure. Like a dirty window—the dirt appears real, yet light shines through. The window was never separate from light.

[9000-9010]
This old hermit once met a student who wept over his many obscurations. "I am too stained to practice," he said. The hermit held up a dirty mirror. "Does the dirt prevent reflection?" The student looked and saw his own face. The dirt was beside the point.

[9005-9015]
In this manner...

[9010-9020]
Voice 20 proclaims: Emaho! The thirty-two stains, the sixty-four empowerments—all are conceptual elaborations! The true empowerment is recognition of mind's nature. All else is finger-pointing. Look at the moon, not the finger!

[9015-9025]
A simple monk...

[9020-9030]
What knows these words?
