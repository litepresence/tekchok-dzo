Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to explain Mahayoga ground, path, and result using his tent as an example. "The ground is like the tent itself," he said. "It's always here. The path is like entering the tent—you think you're going somewhere. The result is realizing you never left." This old practitioner nodded, then asked: "Where do you keep your confusion?" The hermit pointed to the corner of his tent where he'd piled his doubts. We both laughed. The ground, as the cause for clarifying, distinguished by the great freedom from elaboration of mind-as-such's ultimate truth, without effort or exertion, is great. Like gold and its yellowness being inseparable. You don't make gold yellow. You don't make mind enlightened.

[3341-3361]
Designated ground: depending on various names, determining the occasion. Ground as object of cultivation: through cultivation, approaching mind's characteristics. But this old practitioner warns: don't cultivate what is already perfected. Don't polish the mirror that was never dusty. Ground for clarifying: ripening is mind's result appearing variously, liberated variously—called spontaneously-arisen wisdom. Ripening is dharmata's result, not accomplished through effort—called Buddha's all-knowing wisdom. The great yoga of realization: ground as object of cultivation, path as agent of cultivation becoming manifest, called great realization yoga. Result self-cultivating: called Buddha's completely pure mind wisdom.

The sadhana-focused tradition has divisions: body sadhana carrying Manjusri's mandala wheel as path; speech sadhana making Padma family Buddha; mind sadhana making Heruka Vajra family Buddha; quality sadhana making Ratna family Buddha; activity sadhana making Karma family Buddha. Their essence: through three samadhis, each sadhana's deity and oneself become inseparable. But this old practitioner asks: who is the one becoming inseparable? Find that one first. Etymology: depending on sadhana, accomplishing the single hero's mandala wheel. Purpose: accomplishing result through cultivating path. Result: becoming respective family's Buddha.

[3390-3410]
Their essence: even merely conventionally, in the occasion of pure convention, viewing external vessel-world as celestial palace, supported sentient beings as deity mandala, seeing all beings as deity forms—purpose of not killing life for yidam, not lying, etc. No deliberate dharma in mind. Ultimately not established as any nature. Not falling into truth-transcendence. Realizing union inseparability—superior to outer. This old practitioner walks through the market and sees every face as a deity form. Some are wrathful, some peaceful, all are teaching. The thief is a deity teaching non-attachment. The saint is a deity teaching virtue. No difference in essence. Only in appearance.

[3341-3354]
Ground in Mahayoga: three aspects. Ground for clarifying (the base), designated ground (names), ground as object of cultivation (practice). All are the same ground viewed differently. Like a mountain seen from valley, ridge, and peak. Same mountain. Different views. Don't confuse the views with the mountain. This hermit spent years studying the views. Forgot to climb. The ground is your own mind. The nature of mind. Clear light. Emptiness. Call it what you will. It's not somewhere else. It's not something you achieve. It's what you are, what you've always been, what you'll always be. Recognize this. That's the ground.

[3355-3361]
Path in Mahayoga: two aspects. Path for clarifying (ritual engagement), order-of-entry path (stages). The generation stage is the path—creating the mandala, visualizing the deity, accumulating merit. This works! But don't think the creation is the reality. The deity appears through your visualization. But the appearing is empty. Both true. Both necessary. This old practitioner created many deities. Forgot to ask: who creates? The creator is also empty. The visualization is also empty. The deity is also empty. But don't stop visualizing because of emptiness. Visualize with the understanding of emptiness. That's the path.

[3362-3389]
Result in Mahayoga: ripening (appearing variously), ripening of dharmata (not accomplished through effort). Two results, one result. Appearances continue, but recognized as self-liberated. That's ripening. Dharmata is always pure, always accomplished. That's the other ripening. Not two separate things. Two aspects of the same. This yogi wanted to "achieve" result. Ran toward it for years. Was already standing on it. The result is not somewhere else. It's not in the future. It's the nature of the path itself. The path walked to completion reveals itself as result. The seeking fulfilled reveals itself as finding.

[3362-3375]
Sadhana-focused tradition: body, speech, mind, quality, activity sadhanas. Each connected to a Buddha family. Manjusri (body), Padma (speech), Heruka (mind), Ratna (quality), Karma (activity). This is systematic! You can work with your predominant tendency. Predominantly angry? Heruka. Predominantly proud? Ratna. But don't get stuck in the classification. The classification is medicine for the disease. When disease is cured, abandon the medicine. This hermit worked with Heruka for years. His anger transformed. But then he had to let go of Heruka too. Even the deity is empty.

[3376-3390]
Essence of sadhanas: through three samadhis (suchness, all-illuminating, causal), deity and self become inseparable. This is union—not two things merging, but recognition of never being separate. Like ice and water. Different appearances, same nature. This hermit practiced union for years. Thought he was becoming the deity. Finally saw: there was never separation, so no union needed. Just recognition. The three samadhis are the structure. Suchness—emptiness. All-illuminating—appearance. Causal—compassion. Three aspects of one reality. Base, path, and result all contained in these three.

[3390-3410]
Pure perception: seeing world as celestial palace, beings as deities. This transforms everything! The person who annoys you? Wrathful deity teaching patience. The beautiful sunset? Peaceful deity teaching appreciation. Nothing to reject, nothing to accept. Just—seeing differently. This old practitioner tried this. Failed often. Succeeded sometimes. Both are practice. Both are the path. The pure perception is not denial. It's not pretending. It's seeing the true nature of things. Everything is deity display. Everything is wisdom display. Even the confusion. Even the suffering. Especially those.

[3362-3410]
Etymology of sadhana: accomplishing the single hero's mandala wheel. Purpose: accomplishing result through cultivating path. Result: becoming respective family's Buddha. Various-path-transformation: many traditions. This hermit collected sadhanas like some collect stamps. One hundred practices! Could barely finish one. His teacher took ninety-nine. "Now," she said, "you might actually accomplish something." One sadhana done completely is better than a hundred done partially. Choose one. Stick with it. Complete it. Then move on. Or don't move on. One is enough.

[3341-3361]
This practitioner returns to the tent analogy. Ground, path, result. The tent is always there (ground). You enter it (path). You realize you never left (result). This is Mahayoga in a nutshell. Not a journey to somewhere else. A recognition of what's always been true. The path creates the conditions for recognition. The recognition reveals the path was unnecessary. But you couldn't recognize without the path. This is the paradox. This is the mystery. This is the tantric path. Walk it completely. Then see: there was nowhere to walk.

Emaho! Mahayoga—great yoga of great illusion. Don't make it small by grasping. Don't make it great by rejecting. Just practice. Visualize the deity. Become the deity. Recognize the deity is your own mind. Recognize your own mind is empty. Rest in that emptiness. Act from that emptiness. Benefit beings from that emptiness. This is the path. This is the fruition. This is the great liberation. Emaho!
