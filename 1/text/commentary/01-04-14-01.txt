Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent a year trying to pronounce "Anuyoga" correctly. He said it a thousand times a day. Finally his teacher said: "You've mastered the word. Now master the meaning." The hermit was silent for three days. "Space and wisdom," he finally said. "Inseparable." His teacher nodded. "Now forget that too." The eighth, Anuyoga scripture vehicle: space and wisdom inseparable, freedom from elaboration, not abiding anywhere. Through completion stage wisdom-focused method. Divisions: scripture and sutra. Scripture: dependent scripture—asserting mind and mental factors; expressive scripture—basis of words and conventions. Sutra: five surpassing the mayajala path.

This old practitioner doesn't know all the names. But he knows: space is not empty like a cup. Wisdom is not knowing like a scholar. They're inseparable like wetness and water. From Self-Arisen Rigpa: "Listen Vajra-holder—the great Anuyoga vehicle: space and wisdom as two, inseparable vajra. Entry door: simultaneous and gradual. View: inseparability. Simultaneous entry: deities not generated, essence remembrance completes. Gradual entry: space and wisdom gradually enter, Vajra-holder attains result on ground." This yogi once tried simultaneous entry before he was ready. Like trying to jump across a chasm before learning to walk. He fell. The falling was also the path.

Five sutras surpassing the mayajala path. This is technical stuff. The five ways Anuyoga goes beyond Mahayoga. Direct, immediate, without elaboration. But this old practitioner doesn't care about the categories. He cares about the experience. Space-wisdom. That's it. Everything else is commentary. The five sutras are descriptions of direct experience. Not philosophy. Not theology. Direct pointing. This is your mind. This is the nature of reality. Recognize it. Rest in it. That's Anuyoga. That's the completion stage. That's wisdom-focused method.

[3481-3492]
From Self-Arisen Rigpa again. This text is the source for much Anuyoga teaching. Entry doors: simultaneous and gradual. Simultaneous: deities not generated, just remember essence. Gradual: space and wisdom enter step by step. Both work. Depends on capacity. This hermit tried both. Simultaneous scared him. Too direct. Gradual felt safer. But both led to the same cliff edge. Eventually, you have to jump. The gradual path is not inferior. It's appropriate for some. The simultaneous path is not superior. It's dangerous for the unprepared. Practice what fits your mind. Practice what you've been taught.

Protected samaya: always respect secret mantra meaning-revealers, offer whatever you have to guru teaching secret mantra, guru and Tathagata without distinction shown as one. In brief: space and wisdom—Anuyoga's view. This old practitioner once had nothing to offer his teacher. He offered his nothing. She accepted it more gladly than gold. Anuyoga asserts result-Buddhahood in one life, intermediate state, or through transmigration. Liberation's basis is space-wisdom, free from constructed dharmas, effort and accomplishment, transference and reversal—empty of conceptual mind's space abiding, spontaneously-arisen wisdom dawning, all dharmas as ground-settling great self-liberation, called effortless self-liberated space-wisdom.

[3502-3510]
This yogi asked: "When is it liberated?" His teacher laughed. "When was it bound?" Space and wisdom inseparable. This is the heart of Anuyoga. Not space as container, wisdom as contained. Not two things in relationship. One thing with two names. Like fire and heat. Like water and wetness. You can't have one without the other. This hermit meditated on this for years. Thought he understood. Then one day—didn't understand at all. That was closer. The understanding is the obstacle. The space that thinks it's space is not space. The wisdom that thinks it's wisdom is not wisdom. Drop the thinking. Just—this.

[3511-3520]
This hermit returns to space and wisdom. Space: not empty, not full. Wisdom: not knowing, not not-knowing. Inseparable. Try to find where space ends and wisdom begins. You can't. They're like two sides of one hand. Like inside and outside of a tent. Artificial distinctions. Useful for teaching, but not the truth. This hermit doesn't remember all the technical terms. But he remembers: space and wisdom are one. The expanse and the knowing are inseparable. This is Anuyoga. This is the completion stage. This is the path of liberation.

[3521-3533]
Effortless self-liberated space-wisdom. The word "effortless" is key. Not that you don't practice. But the practice is not what causes liberation. Liberation is already the case. Practice reveals what was hidden. Like removing a cover from a lamp. The lamp was always lit. You just couldn't see it. This yogi removed covers for years. Some were heavy. Some were light. All were unnecessary. The effort was the obstacle. The practice was the problem. But he needed to practice to see this. That's the paradox.
