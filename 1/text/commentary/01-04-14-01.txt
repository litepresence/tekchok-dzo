[3341-3361] The ground, as the cause for clarifying, distinguished by the great freedom from elaboration of mind-as-such's ultimate truth, without effort or exertion, is great. Like gold and its yellowness being inseparable. Designated ground: depending on various names, determining the occasion. Ground as object of cultivation: through cultivation, approaching mind's characteristics. Distinguished by ground-settling and self-liberated samādhi. Path for clarifying: through the path of manifest realization, abiding in Piṇḍārtha's path, accomplished. Through accomplishment, cultivation: called the path of transformation samādhi. Order of entry, path of complete liberation: depending on the arising order of the path of concordant conditions and yoga, entering the mahāsiddha body, claiming realization self-liberates.

[3355-3361] Result for clarifying: ripening is mind's result appearing variously, liberated variously—called spontaneously-arisen wisdom. Ripening is dharmatā's result, not accomplished through effort—called Buddha's all-knowing wisdom. The great yoga of realization: ground as object of cultivation, path as agent of cultivation becoming manifest, called great realization yoga. Result self-cultivating: called Buddha's completely pure mind wisdom.

[3362-3410] The sādhana-focused tradition has divisions: body sādhana carrying Mañjuśrī's maṇḍala wheel as path; speech sādhana making Padma family Buddha; mind sādhana making Heruka Vajra family Buddha; quality sādhana making Ratna family Buddha; activity sādhana making Karma family Buddha. Their essence: through three samādhis, each sādhana's deity and oneself become inseparable. Etymology: depending on sādhana, accomplishing the single hero's maṇḍala wheel. Purpose: accomplishing result through cultivating path. Result: becoming respective family's Buddha. Various-path-transformation: many traditions of gradual, subtle, and net-dependence, but collected into tantra and nipa two. Tantra has generation-stage-focused, completion-stage-focused, and union-focused—and so on. Nipa has two: svātma-nipa, mind-focused with limbs; maṇḍala-nipa, maṇḍala-entry with limbs. Depending on Piṇḍārtha and Abhisamaya-mañjari's deity distinctions.

[3390-3410] Their essence: even merely conventionally, in the occasion of pure convention, viewing external vessel-world as celestial palace, supported sentient beings as deity maṇḍala, seeing all beings as deity forms—purpose of not killing life for yidam, not lying, etc. No deliberate dharma in mind. Ultimately not established as any nature. Not falling into truth-transcendence. Realizing union inseparability—superior to outer. Ultimately no deity, so no entities or signs. Conventionally, purifying aggregates, elements, etc. as deity maṇḍala. Purifying five aggregates, five elements, five objects, five faculties, five afflictions, etc. But in truth, purifying ground is dharmadhātu's natural purity; purifying object is aggregates, elements, grasper-grasped, etc.; purifying agent is generation-completion method stages; purifying result is not even established as kāya and wisdom—this is their view.
