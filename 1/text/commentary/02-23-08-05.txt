: that person's breath not separated, syllable breath with doubtless abiding purifying. Generally beings not seeing this Dharma's door, higher realms drawn, this method shown.

That person's heart inside

[14665-14702]
Listen! Bindu appearance ceases. One instant, spontaneously accomplished appearance ceases. One instant, primordially pure truth seen. That too emanation from primordially pure ground not separate. Path faculties all's suchness obtained. Like example shooting star sky running manner. Shooting star that, light radiating-like, emanation opening, beings' benefit doing. Benefit three days capable.

Sharp faculties' peak: One day bardo abiding. That too four joining pristine awareness appearance, own appearance seeing. That too own eye from pristine awareness fire two arisen. Weapon rain falling that all ceased. Appearance ceasing non-existent dawning. That own consciousness awakening. Own object seeing. Spontaneously accomplished ground certainty obtaining. Again shooting star-like should know.

Sharp faculties' supreme: Two days Buddha. That too bindu appearance one day abiding. That too own heart from pristine awareness sun one dawns. From that light rays ten directions radiate. From that light rays' tip each each Tathagata body each dawns. By that appearance's objects all body's nature seen. Then again spontaneously accomplished appearance certainty obtaining, emanation seven days capable of benefit. That too shooting star-like.

Sharp's excellent: Three days bordo abiding. That too bindu one day abiding. That too certainty obtaining, pristine awareness appearance, own appearance aspect one dawns. That too two days abiding. First day light seen. Second day body seen. That body also big coarse seen. That confidence, spontaneously accomplished ground certainty obtaining. That too shooting star-like. Emanation also eleven days capable of benefit. Sharp's sharp.

Emaho! The sharp faculties liberate fastest—sometimes in one instant! They see the bindus, recognize them, and dissolve into the natural state. The "shooting star" is the sudden flash of recognition. Don't compare yourself to others—whatever your capacity, recognition liberates!

[14681-14700]
white light sphere egg-like contemplated, gradually upward-going contemplated, together with own also that consciousness thus contemplated; oneself also that consciousness thus contemplated, with that person's age-years wind outward going long and short joined, short time with vowel reciting. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Breath rough going time

, that crown mouth-directed, a-a twenty-one spoken, wind phu-ru-ru comes, even evil one higher realm proceeds; intellectual view-meditation also dharmata proceeds. Recognition is immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Listen! Four days bardo abiding. That too own front, five bindus beautifully arranged, seeing. That own latency awakened, east bindu one day abiding. Likewise four directions' bindus one day each abiding. Then again spontaneously accomplished certainty obtaining, Buddha. Emanation also fourteen days capable of benefit.

Sharp faculties' medium: One day seeing. Five days seeing. That too thus: Four days bindu abiding. One day pristine awareness appearance abiding. That too own heart from light rays horse-drum-like one arisen. That too sky's expanse pillar-like coming. That own eye not distracted holding, looking. Sky's center, great bindu one beautifully clear that seeing. That confidence greatly arising. Own is thought consciousness one arisen. Confidence mother lap child entering pith instruction called.

Then that own awareness dissolving-dissolving. Non-reversing great measure arrow-like pith instruction called. Emanation also twenty-one days capable of benefit.

Sharp faculties' end: Six days needed. That too bindu four days. Pristine awareness and dharmadhatu one day. Likewise mirror-like one day. Then again own two eyes from pristine awareness mirror clear two excellently dawning. From that appearance immeasurable radiating. One own above bindu one seeing. One own front also great bindu one seeing. Then certainty obtaining, Buddha. Emanation also twenty-five days capable of benefit.

Emaho! The bindus (spheres of light) are the display of your own nature! When you see them, don't just watch—recognize them as your own awareness. The "mother lap child" is awareness returning to its source. These aren't complicated rituals—they're descriptions of what happens naturally when you recognize!

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Emaho!

[14738-14749]
Listen! Non-reversing certainty obtained. Dissolution not held's time there, emanation dividing. Emanation days however dividing, that much abiding, then emanation also sun setting time rays gathering-like, awareness gathering, primordially pure ground dissolving. Wisdom subtle analyzing, this too crucial point great understanding existing. Second, medium faculties seven's liberation manner, five instants. From Blazing Body Relic: Suchness bardo, instant liberation. Thus said. First instant, own appearance various dawns. Second, seen.

[14741-14749]

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
