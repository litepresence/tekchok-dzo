Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me: "What is illusion?" I showed him the smoke from my fire rising through the hole in the roof. "Is that real?" he asked. "It appears," I said. "Does it exist?" "It appears to exist." "Is that an answer?" "It's the only answer." The first Svatantrika position: objects and perceivers aren't established, but non-established awareness-wisdom, inexpressible in words or thought, exists ultimately in the manner of illusion. From the Mother Sutra: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Even nirvana is like a dream, like an illusion." This old practitioner memorized that verse. Recited it daily for ten years. Then one morning forgot it. That forgetting was more liberating than a thousand recitations.

The second position says that ultimately not even illusion is established. Without objects or aspects, even self-cognizing experience of their absence doesn't exist—like without a daughter there's no consciousness apprehending her. Conventionally not truly existent, ultimately nothing abides. When waking from a dream, the appearance of horse and cow ceases, yet... yet what? This old practitioner has been sitting with that "yet" for thirty years. The higher Svatantrikas go further than the lower. They say: not even illusion-like existence is ultimately real. Conventionally, yes. Things appear like illusions. But ultimately? Nothing abides. Nothing is established. Not even the wisdom that knows this. Not even the emptiness that is known.

Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me he had finally understood non-abiding. "I abide in non-abiding," he said proudly. I asked him: "Where do you put your pride?" He had no answer. The first position of higher Svatantrikas: through non-existence, objects are not established as ceasing. From the Mother Sutra: "Ultimately, samsara does not exist. Nirvana does not exist. Emptiness does not exist. Only words indicate meaning." This is their position. The higher Svatantrikas are called "higher" because they don't abide anywhere. They don't even abide in illusion-like existence. They transcend all positions, all establishments, all views.

The eight non-abidings enumerated: conventional, causal, negation, negator, one, many, neither-one-nor-many, mere-appearance. Each is a way of not landing anywhere. But the listing itself becomes a place to land! This is the irony. You collect the non-abidings like trophies. "I know eight ways to not abide!" The knowing becomes the abiding. The list becomes the prison. This old practitioner had lists like this. Burned them all. The fire was warm. The ashes were light. The freedom was worth the loss of knowledge.

[3076-3085]
This old practitioner spent three years memorizing the names of all the non-abiding positions. Conventional non-abiding, causal non-abiding, negation non-abiding, negator non-abiding, one non-abiding, many non-abiding, neither-one-nor-many non-abiding, mere-appearance non-abiding—countless variations. Each one more subtle than the last. Each one a finger pointing at the same moon. Finally his teacher asked: "Do you want to know the names of all the fingers, or do you want to see the moon?" He burned his list of names. Best fire he ever made. The warmth lasted for days.

[3086-3092]
Prasangika Madhyamaka: not only is nothing ultimately established, but conventionally too, mere appearance established as illusion—all such positions being refuted—assert transcendence of existence and non-existence extremes, free from all positions. From the Samadhiraja Sutra: "Permanent and impermanent—these are extremes. Existent and non-existent—both are extremes. Therefore, having abandoned both extremes, the wise do not abide even in the middle." This yogi once thought "not abiding in the middle" meant finding another place to abide. Took him five years to understand: there's no place, not even "no place."
