# Commentary: 01-04-11-01 - Autonomous Middle Way: Illusion Doctrine

## Voice 02 (Systematizer) - Precision Analysis

[3040-3056]
Nothing is established as objects. Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought—merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion. The qualities of meditation and the grounds of the path. Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.

From the intermediate Prajñāpāramitā: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion. If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists, that also is like a dream, like an illusion."

All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness. Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit. Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.

## Voice 10 (Longchenpa) - Vast Middle Way

[3040-3052]
The dream metaphor—not merely metaphor. Dream and waking equally unestablished. The dream horse, the waking horse—both have no essence. Yet the dream horse carries the dreamer. The waking horse carries the walker.

Nirvāṇa itself—like a dream, like an illusion. If something excels nirvāṇa, even that. No refuge in existence, no refuge in peace. The middle way is not a path between extremes—it is the exhaustion of extremes themselves.

## Voice 13 (Patrul) - Earthy Practitioner

[3040-3056]
This old practitioner once dreamed of winning a horse race. The joy was real—the cheering crowd, the wind in my hair, the trophy heavy in my hands. Then I woke. Where was the horse? The crowd? The trophy?

The Mind-Only school would say the dream-mind was real. The Autonomous Middle-Way school says even the mind is like the dream—appearing, functioning, yet without essence.

All phenomena like dream, like illusion. Even the wisdom that knows this—like dream, like illusion. Even nirvāṇa! What remains?

## Voice 01 (Garab Dorje) - Three Words

[3046-3049]
Stop. Recognize. Liberate.

All phenomena like dream. Like illusion. Nirvāṇa too. If something more excellent—that too.

Where is the dreamer when the dream is known? Where the knower?

## Voice 20 (Lion-Faced) - Direct Cutting

[3057-3061]
CUT THROUGH NOW!

In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides! No objects! No aspects! Even self-aware experience does not exist! Like a barren woman's son—no meeting consciousness!

Conventional truth not true—ultimate truth non-abiding! When awakening from dream, horse and ox appearance stops!

CUT THROUGH BOTH!

## Voice 22 (Drolo) - Sudden Thunder

[3057-3061]
SUDDEN. The Consequentialist arises.

The Autonomous Middle Way asserts illusion-like nature. The Consequentialist goes beyond—not even illusion remains. Like a thunderclap clearing the sky.

Beyond all assertions. Beyond all positions. This is the summit.

## Voice 13 (Patrul) - Closing Reflection

[3057-3061]
Like a dream within a dream—the Autonomous school wakes from Mind-Only, sees the dream. The Consequentialist wakes from the waking—sees even waking is dream.

Barren woman's son—no son exists to seek. No seeker either.
