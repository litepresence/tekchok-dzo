Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me: "What is illusion?" I showed him the smoke from my fire rising through the hole in the roof. "Is that real?" he asked. "It appears," I said. "Does it exist?" "It appears to exist." "Is that an answer?" "It's the only answer." The first Svatantrika position: objects and perceivers aren't established, but non-established awareness-wisdom, inexpressible in words or thought, exists ultimately in the manner of illusion. From the Mother Sutra: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Even nirvana is like a dream, like an illusion." This old practitioner memorized that verse. Recited it daily for ten years. Then one morning forgot it. That forgetting was more liberating than a thousand recitations.

The qualities of meditation—the paths and bhumis—and the final result, the Buddha's illusion-like wisdom, having attained that, one acts for beings from within the dharmakaya. All phenomena are the various objects and consciousnesses. Nirvana means manifesting the form kaya and acting for beings. Therefore, there is no phenomenon higher than the self-cognizing suchness and the sublime dharmakaya—this is their position. Among these, some assert illusion as truly established, some as merely appearing like illusion, some as simply illusion—many variations. These are called the lower Svatantrikas. This yogi once met a lower Svatantrika who could debate for three days about whether illusion was truly established or not. Impressive! But could he rest in the illusion of his own debating?

[3053-3061]
The second position says that ultimately not even illusion is established. Without objects or aspects, even self-cognizing experience of their absence doesn't exist—like without a daughter there's no consciousness apprehending her. Conventionally not truly existent, ultimately nothing abides. When waking from a dream, the appearance of horse and cow ceases, yet... yet what? This old practitioner has been sitting with that "yet" for thirty years. The higher Svatantrikas go further than the lower. They say: not even illusion-like existence is ultimately real. Conventionally, yes. Things appear like illusions. But ultimately? Nothing abides. Nothing is established. Not even the wisdom that knows this. Not even the emptiness that is known.

[3040-3052]
The lower Svatantrikas hold that illusion-like existence is ultimate truth. This is subtle! They're not saying things exist solidly. They're saying things exist like illusions—appearing but empty, functioning but unreal. It's a middle position between Mind-Only (mind truly exists) and Prasangika (nothing is established). This hermit spent years here. It's comfortable. You have something to hold onto—illusion-like existence. A positive statement about the ultimate. But eventually, even that must be released. The higher view awaits. The view of non-abiding. The view of no view.

[3053-3061]
Higher Svatantrikas go further. Not even illusion-like existence is ultimately established. Conventionally, things appear like illusions. But ultimately? Nothing. No existence, no non-existence, no illusion, no non-illusion. This is closer to Prasangika. The difference is subtle—Svatantrikas still use positive language, still establish positions. Prasangikas only negate. Both lead to the same mountain. Different paths up. This old practitioner prefers the Prasangika approach now. More direct. Less to hold onto. But he respects the Svatantrika path. Many need it. The gradual approach. The systematic presentation. There's no one right way.

[3057-3061]
The three variations on illusion: some say illusion as truly established, some as merely appearing like illusion, some as simply illusion. This hermit finds these distinctions exhausting. But they're important for scholars. For practitioners? Just practice. Sit. Look at your mind. See what's there. See what's not there. The classifications won't help you do that. Only doing it will help. This yogi spent years trying to figure out which variation was correct. Debated, studied, argued. Finally his teacher said: "You're looking at the finger. Look at the moon." He looked. The moon was beautiful. The finger was just a finger.

[3040-3052]
From the Mother Sutra: all phenomena dream-like, illusion-like. Even nirvana. This is shocking to some! They think nirvana is real, solid, permanent. But no—nirvana too is empty. If there were something higher than nirvana, that too would be empty. Emptiness is the nature of all things, without exception. This old practitioner spent years seeking a solid nirvana. A safe place. Finally realized: even safety is empty. Even refuge is empty. This is the ultimate refuge. Not a place. Not a state. Not an achievement. Just—this. Whatever this is. The nature of mind. The emptiness of all phenomena. Beyond words, beyond concepts, yet right here.

[3053-3061]
The analogy: without a daughter, no consciousness apprehending her. Without objects, no perceiver. Without appearances, no emptiness. Without samsara, no nirvana. They're interdependent, not independently existing. This is dependent arising, the heart of Buddha's teaching. This hermit used to think dependent arising was complicated philosophy. Now he sees: it's just how things are. Obvious, once seen. Invisible, until seen. Everything depends on everything else. Nothing stands alone. Nothing has its own inherent nature. This is emptiness. This is freedom.

[3040-3061]
Svatantrika in general: illusion-like existence, ultimate truth, paths and bhumis, Buddha's wisdom. All these are held as existent in some sense. Higher Svatantrika: not even illusion is ultimately established. The difference is like the difference between saying "the reflection in the mirror is real as a reflection" and saying "the reflection is not even established as a reflection." Both are true. Second is more subtle. Both lead to liberation. This old practitioner started with the lower view. Needed something positive to hold onto. Gradually moved to the higher view. Now he's not sure he holds any view at all.

[3057-3061]
This practitioner returns to the higher Svatantrika view. Ultimately nothing abides. Conventionally, illusion-like appearance. This is a good resting place for many. Not too solid, not too empty. But don't rest too long! The path continues. The Prasangika view awaits. Not even this position is ultimately tenable. All positions are provisional. All teachings are fingers pointing. Don't worship the finger. Look at the moon. This is the way. This is the Middle Way. Not eternalism, not nihilism. Just—the way things are. Dependently arisen. Empty. Free.

[3053-3061]
The transition from lower to higher Svatantrika mirrors the practitioner's journey. First, you need something positive to hold onto—illusion-like existence. Then you see: even that's too much. Even that's a grasping. Release it. Rest in non-abiding. But don't make non-abiding into a position! This is the subtle trap. Every position, even the position of no-position, can be grasped. The grasping is the problem, not the position. This hermit has grasped at non-abiding. Very sophisticated grasping! But grasping nonetheless. The path is endless. The release is endless. Or rather—there is no path. There is no release. Just this. Emaho!
