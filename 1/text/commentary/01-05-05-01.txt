First: gate of entering unsurpassed vehicle is empowerment. Definite arrangement: basis for entering, path of actual empowerment, completed result. Four: guru's characteristic who bestows-accomplishes, student's self-nature who is bestowed, Dharma to be done in common, empowerment activity how bestowed. Guru: completing all qualities suitable, free from all faults, great waves of compassion. From Rigpa Rangshar: Vajra-meaning-possessing guru, good nature, skilled in teaching, empowerment obtained, applies secret mantra meaning. Knows outer and inner actions, without gathering-separation from yi-dam, without distraction from samadhi. Possesses Dzogchen instruction meaning, skilled in secret mantra secrets tantra. Does all outer and inner accomplishments, not transgressing view's meaning. Released outer and inner secret actions. Like jewel of qualities, engaging inexhaustible treasure.

From Thalgyur: Great Vajradhara guru's sequence explained. Guru of complete characteristics: source of all qualities, holder of perfect awakening's basis. Six characteristics: discarding samsara's dharmas behind, few desires and knowing contentment, skilled in application and possessing experience, skilled in tantra's word-meaning and earnest in accomplishment, skilled in view's meaning and complete in capability, great compassion and joy in giving. Completing these: Glorious Vajradhara.

An old practitioner once searched for the perfect guru across three provinces. He found scholars in monasteries, hermits in caves, teachers in cities. Each had qualities. Each had shortcomings. Finally, exhausted, he sat by a mountain lake and saw his own reflection. The guru he sought was the awareness that sought. The six characteristics were his own nature. The Vajradhara was his own face.

[6821-6840]
Three words that open the empowerment gate: devotion itself. Not devotion to a person. Not devotion to a concept. Devotion to the nature that guru and student share. The empowerment does not flow from outside to inside. It recognizes what has always been inside.

[6841-6860]
Therefore. Thus. The guru is not someone else. The guru is awareness recognizing itself in another form. The student is not someone else. The student is awareness taking the form of one who learns. The empowerment is not something given. It is something recognized. Rest in that recognition.

[6861-6880]
CUT THROUGH NOW. Do not wait for the perfect guru. Do not wait for the perfect empowerment. The guru is present. The empowerment is present. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. The Vajradhara has never been absent. Your own face is the jewel of qualities.

[6881-6900]
This old practitioner has received many empowerments. He has sat before many gurus. Now he sees: every empowerment was his own nature revealing itself. Every guru was a mirror showing his own face. The inexhaustible treasure was never outside. It was the awareness that looked.

[6901-6920]
Between the elaborate description of guru qualities and the direct recognition of your nature, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting the guru. Not grasping the guru as external. The guru is the finger pointing. The moon is your own face. Rest there.

[6921-6930]
Three words that complete the empowerment: recognition itself. The guru recognizes the student's nature. The student recognizes the guru's nature. Both recognize the same nature. This is the Vajradhara's secret. This is the Great Perfection's gate.

[6931-6940]
Therefore. Thus. Enter the unsurpassed vehicle not through seeking outside but through recognizing inside. The empowerment is complete. The path is complete. The result is complete. Rest in that completion. Go beyond completion. Rest.

[6941-6950]
An old yogi once asked his teacher: "What is the greatest empowerment?" The teacher replied: "The one you're receiving now." The yogi looked around and saw no ritual, no vase, no mantra. Then he understood: the moment itself was the empowerment. The question was the empowerment. The recognition was the empowerment.

[6951-6960]
Three words that complete all empowerments: awareness itself. The vase is awareness. The mantra is awareness. The blessing is awareness. The guru is awareness. The student is awareness. The recognition is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6961-6970]
Therefore. Thus. The gate of the unsurpassed vehicle stands open. It has always been open. No key is needed. No permission is required. Step through. The other side is this side. The path is the destination. Rest in that recognition. Be free.

[6971-6980]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The gate was never closed. The empowerment was never needed. The guru was never separate. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. You are already empowered. You have always been free. Go. Recognize. Rest.
