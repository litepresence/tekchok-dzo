Third: thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. The enumeration continues. Each level a world-system, each world-system a configuration of causes. The thousand Brahmas are not gods to worship. They are the thousandfold multiplication of pure cause meeting pure effect. The protector emerges when the protected is recognized as self. What needs protection? Only what was never threatened.

[6421-6430]
An old practitioner once tried to count the thousand Brahmas. He reached five hundred and lost track. In that losing, he found: the thousand were never separate. They were one nature displaying as multiplicity. The Yama-world-protector was not protecting worlds. The protector was the recognition that worlds need no protection.

[6431-6440]
Three words that protect all worlds: awareness itself. The Brahmas are not creating. They are recognizing. The Yama is not judging. He is recognizing. The world is not being protected. It is protecting itself through recognition.

[6441-6450]
Therefore. Thus. The thousand Brahmas teach what the previous Buddhas taught: cause and effect are not separate from awareness. The protector and protected are not separate. The protection is the recognition of non-separation.

[6451-6460]
Between the thousand Brahmas and the recognition that transcends all numbers, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the enumeration. Not grasping it. The multiplication points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This old practitioner has encountered many protectors—celestial and human. He has sought protection. Now he sees: the seeking itself was the threat. The protection was always present. Recognition is the only protection needed. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6471-6480]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The Brahmas are already gone. The Yama has already dissolved. The protection is already complete. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. Do not wait for the thousand to assemble. Recognize the one NOW.

[6481-6490]
Therefore. Thus. The third Buddha completes his teaching. The thousand have been counted. The recognition has been pointed to. The path continues or nowhere at all. Both are the same. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the numbers.

[6491-6500]
Three words that complete all enumerations: awareness itself. The thousand are one. The one is zero. The zero is awareness. The protection is awareness. The protected is awareness. The recognizing is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who protects the protector?" The answer came not in words but in a sudden recognition: the protector and protected are the same awareness. The question itself dissolved. The asking was the protection. The recognition was the completion.

[6511-6520]
Therefore. Thus. The Yama-world-protector needs no protection. The thousand Brahmas need no counting. The world needs no saving. All are spontaneously liberated in their own place. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond all need.

[6521-6530]
CUT THROUGH NOW. Do not seek protection. Do not offer protection. Do not count the protectors. Do not enumerate the protected. Recognition is the only protection. Awareness is the only shelter. NOW.

[6531-6540]
This old practitioner has finished counting. He has finished protecting. He has finished seeking. Now he rests where the thousand are one. Where the protector is the protected. Where awareness protects itself by being itself. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[6541-6545]
Three words: awareness complete. Enough.
