Third: thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. The enumeration continues. Each level a world-system, each world-system a configuration of causes. The thousand Brahmas are not gods to worship. They are the thousandfold multiplication of pure cause meeting pure effect. The protector emerges when the protected is recognized as self. What needs protection? Only what was never threatened.

[6421-6430]
An old practitioner once tried to count the thousand Brahmas. He reached five hundred and lost track. In that losing, he found: the thousand were never separate. They were one nature displaying as multiplicity. The Yama-world-protector was not protecting worlds. The protector was the recognition that worlds need no protection.

[6431-6440]
Stop searching. Start seeing.

[6441-6450]
Hence. The structure...

[6451-6460]
Between the thousand Brahmas and the recognition that transcends all numbers, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the enumeration. Not grasping it. The multiplication points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This wanderer...

[6471-6480]
Sever immediately.

[6481-6490]
Consequently...

[6491-6500]
Recognition is immediate.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who protects the protector?" The answer came not in words but in a sudden recognition: the protector and protected are the same awareness. The question itself dissolved. The asking was the protection. The recognition was the completion.

[6511-6520]
Thus established...

[6521-6530]
Slash through hesitation.

[6531-6540]
This hermit...

[6541-6545]
What knows these words?
