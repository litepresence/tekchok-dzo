The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The text describes the five Buddha realms and the central wrathful realm where even those with dull faculties can attain liberation. These are not mythological locations but the natural display of enlightened mind. When recognition occurs in the bardo, one naturally abides in these pure fields.

The key point throughout all these teachings is recognition (ngo shes). Whether you are:
- A practitioner with sharp faculties who recognizes instantly in the clear light
- A medium practitioner who works through the four wisdom preparations
- Or a dull faculty practitioner who needs to reach the natural emanation fields

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

All can attain liberation if they recognize the nature (rang bzhin) of their own mind!

The "shooting star" analogy appears throughout—the sudden flash of recognition that liberates instantly. Don't think you need eons of practice. An instant of pure recognition is enough.

The twenty-one faculties represent the full spectrum of sentient beings' capacities. Whichever describes you, there is a path. The teachings are exhaustive so that no one is left out.

Remember:
1. All appearances are your own display (rang snang)
2. Recognition liberates (ngo shes grol)
3. No recognition, wandering continues (ma ngo 'khyams)
4. The nature is originally pure (ka dag)
5. The display is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub)

Train now in recognizing the nature (rang bzhin) of mind in this life. Familiarize yourself with the clear light in meditation and sleep. Then when death comes, you will recognize the clear light of death as your own nature, and liberation is certain.

This completes the commentary on Volume 2, pages 321-370, covering the bardo teachings, the spontaneously accomplished visions, the four wisdom preparations, clairvoyance, and the natural emanation pure fields.

May all beings recognize their own nature and attain liberation!

Emaho!

Emaho!

[15563-15604]
Listen! There is a great charnel ground called Blazing Ye Mountain. It has a measureless palace like this: A skull house four stories high. It is thus: Dry skulls as fruit, flesh and blood as walls, intestines with veins as roof. Measures and height immeasurable. Thunderbolt nails. Rakta as gutter water. Sun and moon as seats. Crocodile mouth as door frame. Eight great gods as pillars. Great supreme foundation. Daytime, wind swirls. Nighttime, fire blazes. Four corners of that palace, great field's canopy spread. Five goddesses dancing. All ground, rakta's waves swirling.

Inside that palace, Bhagavan Youthful Hero Powerful, mind unmoving from peace, yet body shown in wrathful aspect. Surrounded by dakinis and immeasurable wrathful gatherings. Thus: Dakini Purna Nyebar Zhiba, Brahma Dung Ngri Can, Rishi Moonlight Youth, and surrounding dakinis Ekajati six sisters, fourteen servant women, fifty-eight assistant women, and assistants hundred-thousand ten-thousand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable dakini retinue.

From Bhagavan's mind emanated retinue, Vajra Holder in hand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable wrathful retinue. Garab Dorje, etc., surrounded by immeasurable human retinue. Turning result Secret Mantra unsurpassed Dharma wheel to retinue, peaceful emanation body bodhisattvas liberated. All have wrathful frowning faces.

That palace is extremely vast. Those faculties' end persons.

Emaho! Don't be shocked by these terrifying images! This is describing the fierce aspect of wisdom—the energy that cuts through delusion. The charnel ground isn't a place—it's the recognition that all appearances are impermanent, all concepts dead. The wrathful deities aren't enemies—they're your own awareness in its most powerful form!

[15605-15634]
Listen! Astonished and amazed, born into emanation body's field realms, merely so it is said. These too, from Bhagavan Vajra Holder's blessings, naturally arranged, therefore called "nature emanation fields." Those fields' continuities—from heart's mirror-like etc., pristine awareness jewel self-clear self-radiance, and in skull house, wrathful mandala, primordially abiding appearance, arise. Appearance to retinue, faculties' objects seen capable cause, and liberation certain cause, should be known as that.

### From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
From Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod: "Faculties' end ones, nature emanation body field, exhaling breath—twenty-fourth chapter." Having extensively explained ground and path stages of Secret Supreme certain liberation through crucial points, now ascertaining where accomplished by that method, perfected ultimate result stage in two: General presentation of manifestly awakening in internal expanse primordially pure ground. Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance.

First has three: Held by liberation place's essence. Explained separately nature of how liberated. Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. First: Self-arisen awareness naturally pure, pure by all adventitious stains, two purities possessed Dharmakaya, non-dual expanse and pristine awareness primordially pure jewel secret womb is ultimate liberation place.

From Self-Arising Awareness: "Liberation place is primordially pure appearance. Like vase body example." "All Buddhas' deliverance place is primordially pure great mandala." From Jewel Heap: "Result Dharmakaya emptiness, entities exhausted, very wonderful."

This is the completion ground! Every being has this nature—just obscured. Liberation isn't going somewhere else—it's recognizing what's always been. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life!
