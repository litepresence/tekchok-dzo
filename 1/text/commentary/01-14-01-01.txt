Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis establishes the fundamental distinction between the basis of mind and the basis of wisdom. The Kunzang Klongdrukpa Tantra speaks: O great bodhisattva, the abode of mind is the all-ground (kun gzhi), because the all-ground gathers all objects of thought and is known as mind. The abode of primordial wisdom is the Dharmakaya, because the Dharmakaya does not possess memory-thought and has no consciousness that grasps objects as different. This is the crucial distinction that separates samsara from nirvana.

[17361-17374]
This old practitioner has seen scholars confuse the ocean with the boat that floats upon it. The all-ground is like the ocean—vast, containing all waves, the support of all container and contained. Dharmakaya is like the clear sky—empty, luminous, without support or supported. Those who equate them are like those who mistake the reflection for the mirror itself.

[17375-17386]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Some with manifest arrogance hold the all-ground as Dharmakaya! They cite common treatises saying the all-ground is the support of all pure and impure, and Dharmakaya is the stainless thusness within purity. Some even say when the all-ground transforms, it becomes the wisdom of the dharma-dimension and essence-body. But this contradicts the scriptures!

[17387-17396]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the fault: if the all-ground were Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya would possess stains. If the all-ground produces delusion of container and contained, Dharmakaya would produce delusion. If one accepts this, it follows that Buddhas would revert to sentient beings. The Kunzang Mind Mirror Tantra states: Those who hold all-ground as Dharmakaya deviate from me!

[17397-17408]
From Rangshar: Some hold all-ground as Dharmakaya. To teach them the reply, the characteristics of all-ground are thus: the all-ground is so-called because all are complete from it. Through the power of various appearances, Buddhas become sentient beings. Why? Because all are complete from it, one becomes Buddha, one becomes sentient being. Through definite establishment, one becomes Buddha, one becomes sentient being.

[17409-17420]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The all-ground is not Dharmakaya. The all-ground is mind mixed with ignorance; Dharmakaya is wisdom free from ignorance. Like a dreamer and the one who wakes—the dreamer must wake from the dream, but the waker was never dreaming.

[17421-17426]
From Klongdrukpa: Therefore, if all-ground and Dharmakaya are not distinguished, they become similar to consciousness that grasps one form as different. Meaning cannot appear individually. The example of these two is like the ocean and boat. Dharmakaya, primordially pure rigpa without defilement, is like a clear ocean. The all-ground, like a boat on the ocean, has never entered the primordial expanse.

[17427-17442]
This old hermit rows his boat across the lake of mind. The water is Dharmakaya—always pure, always clear, never disturbed by the boat. The boat is all-ground—carrying karma, habits, delusions, filled with many persons. The distinction is very great: one must wake from sleep and dream, but self-awareness needs no reversal.

[17440-17448]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: Rigpa without defilement, the essence of Dharmakaya, is not an object of reversal at any time and exists as the final liberation-ground. The all-ground, like sleep, becomes the basis for all dreams of deluded appearance. One must wake from it. Dharmakaya is the basis to be examined, the state to be familiarized, identified as the place of liberation-result.

[17448-17464]
Voice 20 proclaims: The all-ground and all dharmas supported by it are to be known as stains to be purified! From Thalgyur: The essential point of all-ground and Dharmakaya—there, first explain all-ground. Basis of all dharma and non-dharma. Nature, word-meaning, division with. Nature is container of all habitual tendencies. Division: body and connection. Various and original-basis. Definitive-meaning: gathered at all.

[17464-17478]
The nature of all-ground has five aspects: nature, definitive-meaning, division, function, cause of entering sound. First, nature: compounded virtuous forms and samsara dharmas, all complete habitual tendencies, become the container. Definitive-meaning: all-many-at. Basis gathered many of time, ground or support-basis as abiding. Division: four types—original-meaning all-ground, connection-meaning all-ground, body-habit all-ground, various-habit all-ground.

[17478-17496]
Between samsara and nirvana, the vast middle way opens. The all-ground serves as the basis for connection to both. The original-meaning is the first ground of samsara's dharmas. The connection-meaning is spoken from the aspect of reversing ignorance co-existing with first movement awareness. The body-habit all-ground speaks from the aspect where flesh, blood, light, and mind-body appear. The various-habit all-ground speaks from being the source of impure karma and habits.

[17496-17514]
This old practitioner spent years trying to purify the all-ground, like polishing a brick to make a mirror. Foolish! The all-ground cannot become Dharmakaya—they are distinct from the first. The all-ground is the sleep; Dharmakaya is the waking. One must abandon the sleep, not transform it into waking.
