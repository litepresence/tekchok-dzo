Dear practitioner, these physical postures are the door to wisdom - practice them! Emaho!

[5685-5692]
Listen, dear practitioner! Through that returning, outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body and mind warmth arises. Two palms' ends pressed to earth, moving action wind returns. Through that returning, outward thigle and thigle-particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping action wind returns. Through that returning, outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts!

[5693-5696]
Dharmakaya's posture also explained in speech: Like three perfected lion's strengths, whoever is without fear, body's key point dispels three realms' fear.

[5697-5699]
Also on meaning's flow distinctions: Continuous sitting key point—body sitting in dog's crouch causes dharmadhatu and rigpa to meet.

Do you see? Your body is the path! Press palms to earth, raise the chin—winds reverse, vision dawns! Do not think this is just exercise. These postures are wisdom's gateway! The body you drag around all day is actually the dharmakaya's throne!

Emaho! Reversing the winds through body postures!

[5743-5744]
.

Dear practitioner, gaze without moving - this is the key! Emaho!

[5745-5746]
Listen, dear practitioner! Through cutting the word's reversal, the word self-arisen wisdom dawns! Through blocking merely one's own speech, dharmas all abide in the inexpressible state—certain!

[5747-5752]
Third, mind's three unmoving: Through not separating from focused stiffness, always abiding in Buddha's intent. Through entering awareness dharmadhatu's scope, not straying from entity's nature. Through always not separating from that itself, four visions measure arrived—certain! Also, moving by moving-turned returning is called—key point of liberating from those!

[5753-5761]
Second, taking measure of three abidings: Three body's abidings free from action. Three wind's abidings taking measure of non-production. Three appearance's abidings confidence in non-reversal. First three: Abiding without dwelling in action, samsara's delusion cannot increase. Abiding in projecting and gathering limbs, delusion's wheel continuity ceases. Placing action in the ground, certain separation from accumulated action's ripening.

[5762-5764]
Second three: Wind not going outward abiding, conditioned appearances various—no harm. Inward not blinking abiding, no support for various conceptual thought. Without going-coming outside-inside abiding, basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two—empty.

Do you see? Not moving is the key! When you stop chasing, wisdom dawns. When you stop blinking, concepts have no place to land. This is not doing something new—this is stopping the doing!

Emaho! Three unmoving, three abiding—liberation without moving!

[5774-5777]
Listen, dear practitioner! Four empowerments' fruit arising as direct becoming! At dharmata direct perception time, body like tortoise-shell vessel put in—body's channels slowly abiding arising. That is Dzogchen meaning, effort-free, body's limbs entered!

[5778-5783]
Pot empowerment's action purified, elaborate wisdom self-arisen certainly arises! At increase-above time, body like person tormented by disease gone—channels, central wind entered arising! Dzogchen negate-assert not-existing meaning generally entered, secret empowerment's action purified, non-elaborate wisdom self-arisen arises!

[5784-5788]
At measure-arrived time, body like elephant sinking in mud—mind channels wind obtained arising! Dzogchen accept-reject not-existing meaning heart entered, prajna wisdom empowerment body purified arising—extremely non-elaborate wisdom self-arisen arises!

Do you see? Each empowerment purifies deeper! Body like tortoise-shell, like diseased person, like sinking elephant—all pointing to wisdom self-arisen!

Emaho! Four empowerments' wisdom self-arisen!

[5802-5804]
Listen! From the pure arising of Dzogchen speech's own face—Dzogchen speech certainly liberated, entered into the resonance of purity, meaning free from elaboration inwardly decided!

[5805-5808]
Speech like a small-pot child emerging from between rocks—like gone! From prajna wisdom's empowerment, compassion gathered, arising! Dzogchen, beyond speech and thought, entered as the controller of speech's meaning, extremely elaborate-free word—grasping's extreme cut!

[5809-5811]
Speech arising like cliff forms—from channel-abiding letters entered into wind's bindu, arising! Dzogchen inexpressible meaning entered into speech's sound!

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your speech is not ordinary chatter—it is the spontaneous display of wisdom! When you speak from recognition, every word liberates. When you rest in the nature of speech itself, elaboration ceases. Do not try to make your speech special—recognize its natural purity, and it becomes vajra speech!

Emaho! Speech liberation through Dzogchen words!

[5830-5833]
Listen, dear practitioner! Extremely elaborate all near ceased, not-existing—empowerment! This also example faith, meaning's certainty! Also body's base is four elements' binding, liberating-released arising. Now elements self-nature return not-possible—main point!

[5834-5838]
Speech's four: express-basis, express-condition, express-object, express-agent—four bindings liberated from. Now word self-nature say not-possible!

[5839-5844]
Mind's four: mindfulness, no-mindfulness, unborn, intellect-transcended—four bindings liberated from. Now think naturally not-established!

[5858-5872]
Thus empowerment four as example, faith by meaning thig-decided. Meaning: body, speech, mind, all dharmas, wind-mind-elaborate-free sphere, luminosity clear gathered!

Do you see? Body cannot be bound by elements! Speech cannot be captured by words! Mind cannot be held by thoughts! You are already empowered!

Emaho! Four empowerments—already complete!

[5873-5880]
Listen, fortunate practitioner! Having heard the Buddha's qualities, do not obtain hope and thrill—the three self-established bodies, complete confidence! Having heard also of action and afflictions' cause and effect, do not fall into delusion-vision samsara fear—confidence beyond cause and effect!

[5881-5885]
Having seen nirvana's own place, do not thrill with hope of liberation—primordial purity self-complete, strong place obtained, confidence! Four arising!

[5886-5889]
From the Jewel Heap Tantra: "Four great confidences of unchanging view, non-returning wisdom measure also taken!" Thus aside from the four extreme reliances, sixteen visions conclude!

Dear practitioner, these four confidences are your own mind's nature! Do not seek them outside. Do not hope for them in the future. They are complete right now, primordially present. The three kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized. Rest in this confidence!

Emaho! Four great confidences—recognize them now!
