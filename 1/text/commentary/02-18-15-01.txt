Dear practitioner, these physical postures are the door to wisdom - practice them! Emaho!

[5685-5692]
Listen, dear practitioner! Through that returning, outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body and mind warmth arises. Two palms' ends pressed to earth, moving action wind returns. Through that returning, outward thigle and thigle-particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping action wind returns. Through that returning, outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts!

Emaho! Reversing the winds through body postures!

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Dear practitioner, gaze without moving - this is the key! Emaho!

[5745-5746]
Listen, dear practitioner! Through cutting the word's reversal, the word self-arisen wisdom dawns! Through blocking merely one's own speech, dharmas all abide in the inexpressible state—certain!

[5747-5752]
Third, mind's three unmoving: Through not separating from focused stiffness, always abiding in Buddha's intent. Through entering awareness dharmadhatu's scope, not straying from entity's nature. Through always not separating from that itself, four visions measure arrived—certain! Also, moving by moving-turned returning is called—key point of liberating from those!

[5753-5761]
Second, taking measure of three abidings: Three body's abidings free from action. Three wind's abidings taking measure of non-production. Three appearance's abidings confidence in non-reversal. First three: Abiding without dwelling in action, samsara's delusion cannot increase. Abiding in projecting and gathering limbs, delusion's wheel continuity ceases. Placing action in the ground (gzhi), certain separation from accumulated action's ripening.

[5762-5764]
Second three: Wind not going outward abiding, conditioned appearances various—no harm. Inward not blinking abiding, no support for various conceptual thought. Without going-coming outside-inside abiding, basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two—empty.

Do you see? Not moving is the key! When you stop chasing, wisdom dawns. When you stop blinking, concepts have no place to land. This is not doing something new—this is stopping the doing!

Emaho! Three unmoving, three abiding—liberation without moving!

[5774-5777]
Listen, dear practitioner! Four empowerments' fruit arising as direct becoming! At dharmata direct perception time, body like tortoise-shell vessel put in—body's channels slowly abiding arising. That is Dzogchen meaning, effort-free, body's limbs entered!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your speech is not ordinary chatter—it is the spontaneous display of wisdom! When you speak from recognition, every word liberates. When you rest in the nature (rang bzhin) of speech itself, elaboration ceases. Do not try to make your speech special—recognize its natural purity, and it becomes vajra speech!

Emaho! Speech liberation through Dzogchen words!

[5830-5833]
Listen, dear practitioner! Extremely elaborate all near ceased, not-existing—empowerment! This also example faith, meaning's certainty! Also body's base is four elements' binding, liberating-released arising. Now elements self-nature return not-possible—main point!

Speech's four: express-basis, express-condition, express-object, express-agent—four bindings liberated from. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[5858-5872]
Thus empowerment four as example, faith by meaning thig-decided. Meaning: body, speech, mind, all dharmas, wind-mind-elaborate-free sphere, luminosity clear gathered!

Do you see? Body cannot be bound by elements! Speech cannot be captured by words! Mind cannot be held by thoughts! You are already empowered!

Emaho! Four empowerments—already complete!

[5873-5880]
Listen, fortunate practitioner! Having heard the Buddha's qualities, do not obtain hope and thrill—the three self-established bodies, complete confidence! Having heard also of action and afflictions' cause and effect, do not fall into delusion-vision samsara fear—confidence beyond cause and effect!

[5881-5885]
Having seen nirvana's own place, do not thrill with hope of liberation—primordial purity self-complete, strong place obtained, confidence! Four arising!

[5886-5889]
From the Jewel Heap Tantra: "Four great confidences of unchanging view, non-returning wisdom measure also taken!" Thus aside from the four extreme reliances, sixteen visions conclude!

Dear practitioner, these four confidences are your own mind's nature! Do not seek them outside. Do not hope for them in the future. They are complete right now, primordially present. The three kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized. Rest in this confidence!

Emaho! Four great confidences—recognize them now!

[5907-5910]
Listen here! From Self-Arisen: "Ground called does not exist elsewhere!
