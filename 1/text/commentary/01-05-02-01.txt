[4283-4303]
First: cutting through the basis. Instant faculties primordially liberated, without basis again. Second: path of leaping over, gradual faculties, relying on channels and winds key, making liberation. Three preliminaries bringing to natural place. Body key, door key, object key. Wind and awareness key, taking experience to four appearances' measure.

[4304-4327]
Therefore. Thus. Body's key: lion's manner, elephant's manner, like a rishi. Door unmoved, clarifying two unmoved, sky itself unmoved. Object's key: pure expanse dwelling, awareness's nature dwelling, all appearances dwelling. Mind changeless self-abiding, memory clear. Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear. Mind slow—memory stream ceases. Body speech slack, free from suffering. Awareness slack, five bodies arise. Awareness arisen, conditions cease. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.

[4328-4350]
Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra, unproduced perfected. Indicating method. Dwelling in stream, called tantra. Second: nature's tantra. Meaning of basis, path, fruition. From that same tantra: Basis, path, fruition determined holding, nature's tantra. Essence: empty-clear awareness's essence, basis path fruition gathered. Definite term pervades all, accomplishing Buddha-nature.

[4351-4375]
Divided: basis, essence, quintessence—three. Basis nature's tantra: first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion. Essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent. Delusion imputed only, not experienced. Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting unceasing. Whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.

[4376-4382]
Essence nature's tantra: primordial wisdom three-stacked, heart-essence manner arisen. Basis nature's tantra that power, basis appearance eye, four lamps arisen. Path's four appearances actually seen. Quintessence nature's tantra: awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened. Essence empty, marks awareness non-gone. Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established. Empty self-appearance arisen, cut cut-off non-existent. Empty-clear indivisible—that awareness's quintessence.

[4383-4400]
Three emptinesses: awareness without comparison—delusion emptied. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied. Three appearances: dimension without day-night, awareness without clear-dimming, dharmata without transformation. Three non-returns: samsara primordially Buddha—no return. Awareness kāya manifest—delusion falls into pure appearance, no return. Dharmata manifold—realization's confidence gained, no return.

[4401-4420]
An old practitioner once tried to read all seventeen tantras in one winter. He studied the Rigpa Rangshar, the Samantabhadra mirror, the lion's power tantra. He understood the words but missed the meaning. The tantras are not books to be read—they are awareness to be recognized. The method tantra shows the path. The nature tantra reveals what is. The quintessence tantra IS what is.

[4421-4440]
Three words that open all tantras: self-arisen, self-liberated, self-perfected. The tantras teach themselves to those who recognize. The seventeen tantras are not separate teachings—they are seventeen aspects of one recognition. Like seventeen windows in one palace, each showing a different view of the same garden.

[4441-4460]
Therefore. Thus. The basis tantra: all Buddhas and sentient beings arise from this. Realizing: entered Buddha's tantra. Not realizing: entered sentient beings' tantra. Same tantra. Different recognition. The method tantra indicates what is indicated. Without basis-awareness, no Buddhas or sentient beings. Realizing and liberated—innermost result.

[4461-4480]
This old fool has studied these tantras for years. He has memorized the classifications. He has recited the texts. Now he sees: the tantra is not in the words. The tantra is the awareness that reads. The seventeen are one. The one is zero. The zero is YOUR face before your parents were born.

[4481-4500]
CUT THROUGH NOW. Do not wait to understand all seventeen tantras. Do not wait for perfect study. The tantra you seek is already present. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. The three heart essences—king, minister, subject. The three essences—three mountain peaks. The three flowers—three suns in one sky.

[4501-4520]
Between the method tantra and the nature tantra, there is no separation. Like a water mill grinding grain—the wheel turns outside, the grinding happens inside. Is the method outside or inside? The question dissolves in recognition. The practitioner who recognizes this stops asking where path ends and fruit begins.

[4521-4540]
The seventeen tantras are like seventeen tools in a craftsman's belt. Each has its purpose. Each has its use. But the craftsman is not the tools. The recognition is not the tantra. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the tantras themselves.

[4541-4560]
Three words that encompass all seventeen: rigpa itself. The tantras do not exist apart from the one who recognizes them. The one who recognizes does not exist apart from the recognition. Stop counting tantras and recognize the tantra-counter. Enough.
