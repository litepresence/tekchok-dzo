Listen! From Great Arrangement Chapter Thirty-Two: "Whoever desires to divide the border—body's action self-reverse outward, now wherever engaged, afterward not thus. That itself reverse, body also not abiding, three realms body also not entering!"

[4193-4198]
Also at first body formation time, speech and mind two relying on that form. First body conduct must be done! Body conduct done, afterward body karma depleted, doing un-enthusiastic, body sins purified purpose exists! From Wheel Arrangement: "Who divided body's border, this samsara's latency exhausted!"

Do you see? Body's border must be divided! Reverse the body's actions! Exhaust samsara's latency!

Emaho! Dividing the body's border!

[4235-4240]
Listen! Voice good-bad difference explained. Briefly, six beings' voices. Mind's mindfulness speech expresses. Here purpose two types: supreme and common divisions.

[4241-4249]
Thus relying on speech's various expressed, three realms samsara continuity ceases. From Supreme Empowerment Tantra: "Fortune possessing, six families' voices, each suitable expressing, six beings' wheel ceases!" As above explained, moment's effort engaged. Great effort, that itself attachment reverse. Ordinary, that itself and appearance all equal, carefree recognition arises.

Do you see? Six beings' voices! Express suitably! Wheel ceases! Recognition arises!

Emaho! Six voices ceasing the wheel!

[4289-4293]
Listen! From Vajra Stacked Palace: "Whoever's conceptualized wheel itself, who can turn it? Afterward that one's mind-stream ceases!"

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[4294-4303]
Then without projection-gathering, natural settling mindfulness' aperture self-ceases! From Glorious Sky Light: "Perception cut, aperture ceases!" Also body speech two without attachment, mind's root cut conduct appropriate. Self-traceless training, liberated from three realms! From Wheel Stacked: "Who divided mind's border, this not turning into mind!"

[4304-4308]
Thus dividing border conduct three makes not entering three realms! From Near Empowerment: "Whichever border divided, not turning in three realms, to that natural settling shown!"

Do you see? Divide the border! Mind-stream ceases! Not entering three realms!

Emaho! Dividing the wheel's border!

[4335-4338]
Listen! Natural settling ritual also: "This time body speech mind's key point, yogi possessing natural settling do!"

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[4339-4345]
These purposes two: Common purpose—body speech mind three's obstacles pacified, sins obscurations purified. Supreme purpose—body speech mind three liberated. From that itself: "This purpose two types, supreme common divisions shown!"

[4346-4354]
Meaning two: Actual basis uncontaminated wisdom continuum shown method two. Actual basis word explanation and meaning flow distinction. First, word extreme decided and meaning foremost settling two. First, actual basis four extremes basis, actual not, like seeing palace not seeing king—some Great Perfection, basis approached, body cannot take in hand, dharmadhatu vast, dying time ordinary death.

Do you see? Natural settling! Two purposes! Know the distinction!

Emaho! Natural settling of body speech mind!

[4366-4375]
Listen here, you who think wisdom is something you can find! Longchenpa destroys your worldly concept with just one phrase: "Later also meeting this difficult, world behind throwing away!" 

What does this mean? The master is saying: When you encounter difficulties in Dzogchen practice, the tendency is to look for some exotic solution, some profound technique from another tradition! But Longchenpa laughs at this - "world behind throwing away" means abandoning ordinary conceptual frameworks entirely!

Don't you see? When practice becomes difficult, your mind immediately starts planning: "Maybe I need a different empowerment, maybe I need special mantra, maybe I need secret technique from ancient text." This is exactly what Longchenpa calls "throwing away the world" - abandoning this very world for some other world!

[4376-4385]
Now the crucial teaching: "Rigpa natural settling actually introduced, vajra hanging-cord's vision seeing called!" What is "natural settling"? It's when awareness simply rests in its own nature, without any effort to maintain or improve it. Like water settling when you stop stirring - clarity happens by itself!

The "vajra hanging-cord" vision - this is profound! When awareness naturally settles, it sees through subtle channels directly. Not some visualization you create, not some technique you practice - it's the natural capacity of rigpa when not disturbed by conceptual mind.

"Also actually cannot be shown, rigpa said common ones expressed but foremost not arrived" - Oh, how this shatters your spiritual materialism! You think realization is something special that only advanced practitioners attain? Longchenpa says NO - rigpa has been expressed to everyone, but "foremost" (most realized) haven't recognized it because they're looking for something else!

"Like Vajra Seat not seeing telling its history, like blind color explaining to others" - This is devastatingly precise! A blind person trying to explain colors reveals their complete misunderstanding. But isn't this exactly what you do when you talk about enlightenment without having recognized it yourself?

[4386-4392]
Listen to this about thoughts! "Sometimes unborn empty rigpa thought, sometimes various dawns thought" - Longchenpa is describing how conceptual mind continues even after recognition! It creates "unborn empty" thoughts and "various dawns" experiences - all still conceptual overlay.

"These two word instruction nicely explained essence empty sky-like, dawning manner not ceasing, like mirror's reflection explained, but now existing-existing!" - The danger here is subtle: You might think "sky-like" means some experience, "mirror reflection" means some realization. Longchenpa says these are just explanations - but awareness itself "now existing" is beyond all concepts!

Do you understand? Natural settling isn't an achievement - it's the cessation of seeking. Vajra vision isn't a technique - it's the natural clarity when seeking stops. Rigpa isn't something to be expressed - it's what's already present, unrecognized!

Emaho! Stop explaining Dzogchen and just let awareness settle!

[4393-4400]
Listen! Thigle relying liberation signs: thigle subtle coil possessing! Rigpa channel key point relying liberation signs: hanging-cord subtle crooked connection possessing! These three rigpa actual not, but relying on that virtue force key point liberates!
