Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to explain Anuyoga divisions using the colors of dawn. "First, the sky shows various appearances without cause—that's the first division. Then, the dawn light itself is wisdom—it doesn't depend on anything else to know. Third, appearance and light are inseparable—neither one nor many." This old practitioner watched the dawn with him. Three days later, the hermit said: "Forget what I said. Just watch." This is Anuyoga. Words point, then you drop the words. The first division: various appearances arise without cause, appearing without distinction. This doesn't mean chaos! It means appearances are self-arisen, not created by someone. They appear without a source, yet they appear. Like dawn light—where does it come from? Nowhere. Everywhere. Both. Neither.

[3731-3740]
The second division: the arising is wisdom itself, so knowing doesn't depend on others; liberation is mind itself, so no returning to causes and conditions. This is crucial! The wisdom isn't somewhere else. It's not achieved. It's the nature of the arising itself. The liberation isn't the result of practice. It's the nature of the mind being liberated. This hermit spent years trying to achieve liberation. Finally gave up. The giving up was the liberation. Not because he did something. Because he stopped trying to do.

[3741-3750]
The third division: free from positing existence or non-existence, without reference point in nature, causeless primordial purity. Without reference point in fabrication, primordially liberated—pressing the seal of neither. Self-liberated abiding wisdom—this is called "self-liberated" because nothing needs to be done to it. It's already free. The appearance is already the nature. The confusion is already the wisdom. This is Anuyoga. Not transforming. Recognizing.

[3751-3760]
These three divisions correspond to schools of thought. Those who assert existence—agreeing with Mind-Only, the variegated school. Those who assert non-existence—agreeing with one's own nature, the variegated school. Those who assert neither existence nor non-existence—agreeing with pith instructions, the variegated school. This hermit has been in all three schools. The first taught him appearance is mind. The second taught him mind is empty. The third taught him neither exists nor doesn't exist. All three are steps. All three are true. All three are provisional.

[3761-3770]
The White Space essence: appearances and conditions self-liberated, so nothing to do, causes pure, abiding—there's nothing to prove about the nature of existence. This is the pinnacle view. Not because it's superior. Because it's the simplest. No view to hold. No position to defend. No philosophy to maintain. Just—appearances self-liberated. Conditions pure. Abiding as is. This hermit doesn't understand all the technical terms. But he understands this: you don't need to fix anything. You don't need to change anything. You don't need to achieve anything. Just recognize what's already the case.

[3771-3780]
Divisions: White Space of the Ocean, White Space of the Sky. Ocean Space: essence, permanence-extreme self-liberated, so without action, liberation liberating; various non-dual. Two divisions: Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space. This is symbolic! Don't look for actual oceans in the sky. The ocean represents vastness. The sky represents limitlessness. Together they represent the nature of mind. Not vast like an ocean. Not limitless like the sky. But pointing toward what cannot be pointed to. This old practitioner keeps a painting of ocean and sky in his tent. Looks at it when confused. Reminds him: it's all symbolic. All pointing. The truth is closer than the painting.

[3781-3790]
Sky Space: unconstructed in dharmata, so mind itself self-liberated. Divisions: Sun and Moon Space, Jewel White Space. Two types. The first: essence pure emptiness, nature unborn primordially liberated. The second: qualities completely perfected, so causes and conditions pure. This is getting technical. This hermit doesn't care about the technicalities. He cares about the pointing. Sun and Moon Space—day and night, clarity and emptiness, appearance and nature. Jewel White Space—qualities, richness, complete perfection. Both point to the same. Don't prefer one. Don't grasp either.

[3791-3800]
Variegated Space School essence: appearances known by mind, non-appearances known by the nature of existence. Divisions: three types—outer, inner, and secret. Outer: without action, so outer variegated. Inner: self-liberated own-position, so outer variegated. Secret: obscurations cleared, secret variegated. Suchness variegated: crucial points releasing. This old practitioner has trouble with all these names. But he gets the point: there are levels. Outer is what everyone sees. Inner is what practitioners see. Secret is what realized ones see. All three are valid. All three are partial. The complete view includes all. Transcends all.

[3801-3810]
The first: causeless, so no reversal—crucial point; conditionless, so appearing like this cannot be harmed by anything—crucial point; cause and condition both absent, so samsara-nirvana not established—crucial point. This is also three crucial points! This hermit counts them on his fingers. Gets confused. Starts over. The point is: no cause, no condition, no result. Not because nothing happens. Because what happens is self-liberated. Cannot be reversed. Cannot be harmed. Cannot be established. This is freedom. Not the freedom to do what you want. The freedom from the need to do anything.

[3811-3820]
The second: not depending on eight vehicles, so progression and effort mind-transcending, thus appearing variously yet not transcending single nature's display. This is the critique of gradual paths! Not that they're wrong. They're appropriate for some. But for those who can handle it, Anuyoga goes directly. No dependence on eight vehicles. No progression through stages. No effort to make. Just—recognize. Just—rest. Just—be. This hermit tried this. Failed. Went back to gradual. Gradually became ready for direct. The path is not linear.

[3821-3830]
Emaho! Anuyoga divisions—various ways of saying the same thing. Don't get lost in the divisions. Don't cling to the classifications. They're medicine for specific diseases. When disease is cured, abandon medicine. This old practitioner has studied all these divisions. Can recite them. And? The reciting doesn't liberate. The understanding doesn't free. Only direct recognition. Only resting in the nature. That's Anuyoga. That's the completion stage. That's the path of the vajra holder.
