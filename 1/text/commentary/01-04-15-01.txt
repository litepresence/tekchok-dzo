[3451-3492] The eighth, Anuyoga scripture vehicle: space and wisdom inseparable, freedom from elaboration, not abiding anywhere. Through completion stage wisdom-focused method. Divisions: scripture and sūtra. Scripture: dependent scripture—asserting mind and mental factors; expressive scripture—basis of words and conventions. Sūtra: five surpassing the māyājāla path: Lightning-wheel five wisdom-displaying basis-path complete, Purba-thal-byin displaying meaning, Glorious Great One surpassing mudrā, Kuntu-Rigpa's sūtra, Lung-chen Yige-namdak's sūtra, space-wisdom simultaneous and gradual, liberation-pervasion, and thödgal. Thus, wisdom-beyond-mind mahāmudrā, space-wisdom bliss-emptiness bodhicitta vehicle. From Self-Arisen Rigpa: "Listen Vajra-holder—the great Anuyoga vehicle: space and wisdom as two, inseparable vajra. Entry door: simultaneous and gradual. View: inseparability. Simultaneous entry: deities not generated, essence remembrance completes. Gradual entry: space and wisdom gradually enter, Vajra-holder attains result on ground. Protected samaya: always respect secret mantra meaning-revealers, offer whatever you have to guru teaching secret mantra, guru and Tathāgata without distinction shown as one. In brief: space and wisdom—Anuyoga's view."

[3493-3533] Anuyoga asserts result-Buddhahood in one life, intermediate state, or through transmigration. Liberation's basis is space-wisdom, free from constructed dharmas, effort and accomplishment, transference and reversal—empty of conceptual mind's space abiding, spontaneously-arisen wisdom dawning, all dharmas as ground-settling great self-liberation, called effortless self-liberated space-wisdom. Various appearances as path's space-wisdom: all various appearances as play directionless dawning, various unceasingly liberated, effortless direction-holding space, pure-illusion directionless wisdom dawning, all dharmas without acceptance-rejection, negation-affirmation, desire—called effortless self-liberated space-wisdom. Great self-liberation free from action: result's space-wisdom not abiding in saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, singular effort-free beyond ground, wisdom dawning beyond view-meditation of extreme-free emptiness, all dharmas bliss-suffering equally realized—called dharmatā beyond action space-wisdom. Space-wisdom gradually entering: abiding, empty, bliss—understood as union without excess or need for rejection. Space-wisdom simultaneously entering: realizing self-arisen dharmatā free from view, exhaustion dharmas, liberation without cause—called simultaneous. Liberation-pervasion entering: everything is, yet nothing is—everything not rejected, nothing to obtain—called liberation-pervasion. Thödgal entering: perception-liberation without needing action or effort—dharmatā perception thödgal-born Anuyoga.
