[2989-2998]
The Mind-Only view corrects the extreme of materialism—the belief that mind arises from matter, that consciousness is merely brain function. But it risks its own extreme: grasping at mind as truly existent, as the absolute foundation. This is why the Middle Way school goes further, showing that mind too is empty of inherent existence. Yet do not dismiss Mind-Only! It is a necessary step. First you must see through the illusion of external matter. Then you must see through the illusion of internal mind. When both external and internal are seen through, what remains? Not nothing—rather, a knowing that is neither inside nor outside, neither mind nor matter, yet the basis of both. This is why Longchenpa will move to the Middle Way view. But for now, rest in the recognition that all appearances are like reflections. They appear, they function, they have consequences. But they do not exist as they appear to exist. The tree you see is not a tree independent of seeing. The sound you hear is not a sound independent of hearing. And the one who sees and hears? Equally without independent existence.
