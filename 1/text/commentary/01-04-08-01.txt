Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me: "The Mind-Only view corrects the extreme of materialism—the belief that mind arises from matter, that consciousness is merely brain function." This old practitioner nodded, then asked: "But what extreme does Mind-Only create?" The hermit was silent for three days. Then he laughed. "The extreme of idealism," he said. "Grasping at mind as truly existent." This is why the Middle Way goes further. Not because Mind-Only is wrong. But because it stops halfway. It sees through external matter but grasps at internal mind. The full realization requires seeing through both. Then neither remains to grasp. This is freedom.

[2989-2998]
First position: when hearing a sound, only sound-consciousness arises, not form-consciousness. When engaging any object, that consciousness arises, others don't. So they assert as many consciousnesses as there are aspects. This is granular, precise, almost scientific. This hermit appreciates the rigor. But he asks: who counts the consciousnesses? Who observes the observation? An infinite regress opens like Russian dolls. You need a meta-consciousness to observe the consciousness, and a meta-meta-consciousness to observe that. Where does it end? It ends with the recognition that the observer cannot be found. The one who counts is also a display of mind. The counting is the insight. Not the number counted.

[2999-3008]
Second position: outer various appearances also arise from consciousness, and the consciousness apprehending them also arises from mind. Like a cracked egg, aspects and consciousness appear as object and perceiver in one mind. This moment when engaging an object, outer-aspect consciousness and inner-apprehending consciousness both arise. But through beginningless habituation, though appearing as two, they are established as nothing other than self-cognition alone—like a cracked egg. This old practitioner once meditated on this. Saw the yolk and white as separate yet together. Mind and its appearances—same relationship. Neither is primary. Neither comes first. They co-arise, dependently, like dancer and dance.

[3009-3016]
But if one outer-aspect consciousness and one inner-apprehending consciousness arise at that time, don't two cognitions arise simultaneously? They say no. The aspect-consciousness is non-conceptual. So no problem. This hermit frowns at this answer. Seems like a dodge! But he's not a philosopher. He's a practitioner. Does it matter if two or one? The experience is what counts. The knowing without grasping. The cognizing without fixation. The key insight of Mind-Only is not the number of consciousnesses. It's that appearances are not external. They're displays of mind. Once you see that, the details don't matter. The recognition matters. The freedom from materialism matters.

[3002-3008]
Third position: outer object aspects appear variously, but one inner apprehending consciousness knows them. Like one monkey entering a castle quickly appears in four directions looking. Through the five gates, one consciousness enters and knows objects. This old practitioner prefers this view. More elegant. One consciousness, many aspects. Like one mirror, many reflections. When knowing, aspects and consciousness are both mind's nature without distinction—like dream appearances and apprehending one's own aspect are non-dual in one sleep consciousness. The dream analogy again! So powerful. In a dream, the dreamer and the dreamed are both dream-mind. Not two, not one. Exactly how waking reality works, say the Cittamatras. This old practitioner spent years investigating dreams to understand waking. The investigation itself was the teaching.

[3009-3016]
This is why Longchenpa will move to the Middle Way view. But for now, rest in the recognition that all appearances are like reflections. They appear, they function, they have consequences. But they do not exist as they appear to exist. The tree you see is not a tree independent of seeing. The sound you hear is not a sound independent of hearing. And the one who sees and hears? Equally without independent existence. This yogi once tried to find the "one who sees" by looking inward. He searched and searched until he realized: the searching was itself the seeing. The seeker cannot be found because the seeker is the seeking. This is the Mind-Only insight. Now go further.

[3017-3027]
Impure false aspects: present various aspects and the consciousness apprehending them are merely the appearance of mind's stains, nothing ultimately separate from non-dual wisdom with qualities. No consciousness established. The Buddha's Dharmakaya, stainless—this non-dual wisdom itself. The confusion—afflictions and wisdom mixed like dirty water. Remove the afflictions, pure wisdom manifests. This is their assertion. Pure: aspects and consciousness not even established as merely false. Eventually, aspects disappear and clear luminosity dawns. Object aspects appear, perceiving mind appears, but both absent—like reflections in a mirror. Only self-cognizing wisdom ultimately exists. This is the Mind-Only attainment. But this old practitioner asks: who attains? Find that one.

[3028-3034]
The pure position is the goal of Mind-Only practice. Not nothingness. Not voidness. But clear luminosity. Self-cognizing wisdom. Knowing without object. Cognizing without cognized. This is not extinction. This is full awareness without the split into subject and object. This hermit has tasted this in deep meditation. Can't describe it. Can only point. The knower and known collapse into knowing. The cognizer and cognized dissolve into cognition. This is what the Cittamatras point toward. But they stop here. They say this is ultimate. The Madhyamikas will say: even this is empty. Even self-cognizing wisdom is dependently arisen. Even the pure position is conventionally true, ultimately empty.

[3035-3036]
Svatantrika and Prasangika—why mention them here? Because Mind-Only is a stepping stone to Middle Way. First you see mind is primary. Then you see mind is empty. The progression matters. You can't start with emptiness. Well, you can, but you'll misunderstand it. Build the foundation. Then demolish it. The demolition is the point. This old practitioner has seen people try to practice emptiness without foundation. They become nihilists. Or they become spaced-out mystics. Neither is correct. First establish that appearances are mind. Then see that mind is empty. Then see that emptiness is also empty. This is the complete path.

[2989-2998]
This hermit returns to the first position. When sound is heard, only sound-consciousness arises. This seems so clear, so obvious. But look closer. What is sound without hearing? What is hearing without sound? Can you separate them? Can you have one without the other? They are like two sides of one coin. Like the two ends of one stick. Distinct yet inseparable. This is the nature of subject and object. Of mind and appearance. Not two. Not one. The Cittamatras see this clearly. But they still grasp at mind. They still think there's something there. The Middle Way will show: even that is empty. Even mind is dependently arisen.

[3017-3027]
This practitioner returns to impure and pure aspects. The Mind-Only school is practical. They give you a path. Start with impure—afflictions and wisdom mixed. End with pure—wisdom alone. How? Through practice. Through purification. Through meditation. But the purification is not removal. It's recognition. The afflictions were never the nature of mind. They were temporary, adventitious, like clouds in the sky. The sky doesn't need to be purified of clouds. The clouds simply dissolve. The sky was always clear. This is the Mind-Only view of purification. Not scrubbing dirt off a mirror. Recognizing the mirror was never dirty.

[2989-3008]
The Mind-Only view is complete in itself. It leads to liberation. It frees you from materialism. It shows you the nature of experience. But it has a limitation. It still establishes something—mind, consciousness, self-cognizing wisdom. The Middle Way will show that even this establishment is unnecessary. Even mind is empty. Even emptiness is empty. This is not a refutation of Mind-Only. It's a completion. A transcendence. Like graduating from school. You don't burn your books. You just don't need them anymore. You can still use them. But you know they're tools, not truth itself.

Emaho! Mind-Only, Mind-Empty, Mind-Beyond—just words until directly known. Don't stop at the words. Go to what they point toward. The finger is not the moon. The teaching is not the truth. The map is not the territory. Walk the territory. Drink the water. Look at the moon. This is the way. Mind-Only points the way. Now walk it. All the way. To the end. Beyond the end. To where there is no path, no walker, no walking. Just—this. Emaho!
