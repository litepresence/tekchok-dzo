Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent three winters arguing about whether sound and consciousness are one or many. He'd heard that when you hear a sound, it's just one consciousness arising—no separate thing called "sound" out there, no separate thing called "hearer" in here. Just the knowing of sound. This old practitioner sat with that until his tea froze solid one morning. He looked at the ice in his cup and laughed—ice and water, same substance. Form and consciousness, same knowing.

The egg-split simile, they call it. Like cracking an egg and finding two aspects inside—aspect and consciousness, object and perceiver—both appearing from one mind. This yogi once tried this literally. Sat for an hour with an actual egg, waiting for enlightenment. The egg eventually rotted. The waiting itself was the teaching.

"When knowing occurs," they ask, "are there two consciousnesses at once—one knowing the aspect, one knowing the knower?" Some hermit answered: "Does a mirror need two reflections to show a face? The face appears, the mirror shows. No separation, no duality. Yet not the same thing either." This practitioner thought about that while watching his frozen breath cloud the air. The breath and the cold air meeting—where does one end and other begin?

False Aspectarians say: outer objects are just deceptive appearance, but the knowing itself is real. This hermit held that view once—solid, certain, comforting. Then one night his frozen butter lamp went out, and in that darkness, he couldn't find the "real knower" anywhere. Just knowing, without anyone owning it.

The distinction between defiled false and stainless pure—this is where it gets subtle. Some say appearances are dirty with confusion until cleaned. Others say they were never dirty, just seen wrongly. This practitioner once spent a whole retreat "purifying" his mind. Came out exhausted. Then he met an old woman who never purified anything, and she seemed clearer than he'd ever been.

Emaho! The Cittamatra paths—so sophisticated, so precise. They analyze consciousness into eight, twelve, fifty-one mental factors. They map the mind like cartographers mapping mountains. But this old hermit's mind refuses to stay mapped. Every time he thinks he's found the ground, it shifts like frozen ground in spring thaw.

[3029-3036]
The criticism from other schools: "If only consciousness exists, who realizes that truth?" The Mind-Only response: consciousness realizes itself, like a lamp illuminating itself. But this practitioner asks: does a lamp need to illuminate itself to be bright? Isn't it already luminous? The searching for self-illumination is already illuminated.
