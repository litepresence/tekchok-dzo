Accordingly. The analysis...

[19441-19455]
A simple monk...

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Second, wisdom ripen bindu: from that, wisdom ripen bindu side abide, color clear sun mandala like. This familiarized again self-appearance see. This is wisdom self-essence directly seen. Wisdom ripen bindu side or horizontal appear, color five clear rays spread—sun like.

[19470-19490]
Stop searching. Start seeing.

[19485-19510]
In this manner...

[19500-19525]
This old hermit remembers his first clear bindu vision—a sphere of light in the heart center. He grasped at it, tried to hold it, and it vanished. Later he learned: the bindu is not an object to possess. It reveals the nature; it is not the nature itself.

[19520-19545]
Voice 20 proclaims: Body ripen therefore awareness body ripen time called, wisdom body ripen called. These bindu channels inside resonance outer appear. Gather families: inner dimension essence body bindu, nature light bindu, compassion ray bindu—three entering bindu. Dimension appear bindu part, weapons, lotus, stupa, net pattern, wisdom castle.

[19540-19565]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears as solid, yet is empty. It manifests as round, yet has no shape. The yogi who recognizes this paradox understands Dzogchen. The yogi who seeks solid form misses the point entirely.

[19560-19585]
Hence. The structure...

[19575-19600]
This old yogi...

[19590-19615]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Don't be attached to bindu appearances! They are signs on the path, not the destination. Like milestones on a road—they show progress, but are not the journey's end. Rest in the nature of mind, and let bindu come and go like clouds in the sky.

[19605-19630]
Consequently...

[19620-19645]
This old hermit's final word: When bindu appears, recognize it as your own mind's nature. When bindu doesn't appear, recognize that as your mind's nature too. The recognition is constant; the appearances vary. Rest in the constant, and let the varying vary.

[19640-19660]
Voice 20 proclaims: The three bindu stages—upright, side, round—are like dawn breaking. First a glow, then colors, then full light. Yet the sun was always there. Your recognition is the sun; the bindu stages are the dawn's progression.

[19650-19670]
Thus established...
