[19441-19460]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals bindu upward-standing. First: bindu upward-stand arise when, wisdom self-essence pure appearance. This time below tent-house like, wisdom castle appear—very clear. Bindu outer light mixed, example space rainbow ground like appear. This repeated familiarization from experience higher increase clear time, eye net pattern, membrane, net, half-net see.

[19441-19455]
This old practitioner once spent months in dark retreat, seeking visions. The bindu appeared as sparks, then rainbows, then elaborate forms. But the real teaching came when the visions ceased—resting in the nature of mind itself, beyond all display. The visions were fingers pointing; the nature is the moon.

[19452-19470]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Second, wisdom ripen bindu: from that, wisdom ripen bindu side abide, color clear sun mandala like. This familiarized again self-appearance see. This is wisdom self-essence directly seen. Wisdom ripen bindu side or horizontal appear, color five clear rays spread—sun like.

[19470-19490]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. This repeated familiarization from, wisdom all dimension appearance spear tip like, three-pointed weapon, five-pointed, weapon various, stacked stupas, great stupa, lotus, flower various, thousand-petalled lotus appearance see. Experience increase measure near arrive.

[19485-19510]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Third, awareness ripen bindu: from that, awareness ripen bindu rim with, self-clear round this familiarized, great pure appearance see. These all bindu outer shape round, familiarization dharma-nature exhaustion practice. Characteristic grasp awareness inner dimension five families exist.

[19500-19525]
This old hermit remembers his first clear bindu vision—a sphere of light in the heart center. He grasped at it, tried to hold it, and it vanished. Later he learned: the bindu is not an object to possess. It reveals the nature; it is not the nature itself.

[19520-19545]
Voice 20 proclaims: Body ripen therefore awareness body ripen time called, wisdom body ripen called. These bindu channels inside resonance outer appear. Gather families: inner dimension essence body bindu, nature light bindu, compassion ray bindu—three entering bindu. Dimension appear bindu part, weapons, lotus, stupa, net pattern, wisdom castle.

[19540-19565]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The bindu appears as solid, yet is empty. It manifests as round, yet has no shape. The yogi who recognizes this paradox understands Dzogchen. The yogi who seeks solid form misses the point entirely.

[19560-19585]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Half-body, solitary, father-mother, five families, sphere, great sphere all see. Experience exhaustion near. Bindu general shape round, familiarized dharma-nature exhaustion practice. These appearances are wisdom's own display—not external, not internal, not both.

[19575-19600]
This old practitioner offers teaching on duration: Some see bindu for moments, others for hours. Duration is not the measure. Recognition is the measure. A moment of recognition is worth more than hours of vision without understanding. The bindu reveals; you must recognize.

[19590-19615]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Don't be attached to bindu appearances! They are signs on the path, not the destination. Like milestones on a road—they show progress, but are not the journey's end. Rest in the nature of mind, and let bindu come and go like clouds in the sky.

[19605-19630]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The bindu upward-stand, wisdom ripen, awareness ripen—these three stages of appearance mark the path of thogal practice. Yet even these are display, not reality. The true nature is beyond all stages, beyond all bindu, beyond all appearance.

[19620-19645]
This old hermit's final word: When bindu appears, recognize it as your own mind's nature. When bindu doesn't appear, recognize that as your mind's nature too. The recognition is constant; the appearances vary. Rest in the constant, and let the varying vary.
