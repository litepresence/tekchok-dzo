[12011-12030]
The disturbances of the world fade, and the inner displays become clearer. Yet do not think 'I must have solitude!' The true solitude is the nature of mind itself.

[12011-12034]
If they lived well and good signs appear, this is appropriate; if they lived badly but good signs appear, it is others' signs affecting them—like finding a rainbow when seeking profit, called "meeting rainbow's meaning."

The Blazing Relics Tantra

, extensive establishment of bardo's manifest complete buddhahood is taught. Two aspects: general bardo arrangement and specific natures extensively explained.

Bardo's essence

[12031-12055]
Some practitioners think they must have perfect conditions—proper diet, proper place, proper time. This is attachment to method. The displays arise from your own awareness, not from external conditions. Yet do not completely abandon method either—these are skillful means.

[12035-12075]
teaches extensively: black sky, rain, steam, wind, hail, dust all indicate hell-realm birth. Yellow fading light, dead sun and moon indicate preta. Dark hazy sky indicates animals. Fierce wind and terrifying clouds indicate asuras. Clear sky with bright luminaries indicates gods. Clear sky with gentle clouds indicates humans.

These signs

[12036-12050]
: external phenomena appearing to internal mind's moment. All appearances from inner dharmadhatu ka-dag elsewhere are bardo's state—ka-dag's display as kayas and wisdoms is pure dharmata bardo; confused appearances of six realms are impure confusion bardo.

Where do pure and impure exist

[12051-12070]
? Between ka-dag's space and emergence, returning to ka-dag must occur, so between ka-dag's nature. From the beginning in first ka-dag

[12056-12080]
When practicing, do not force the gaze. Let the eyes rest naturally in space. The bindus will appear on their own. If you strain, you will develop headaches and eye problems. Be gentle, be natural.

[12071-12085]
, confusion's basis is inexpressible; non-confusion likewise. This point, if wisdom exists, is the great crucial seal.

Bardo's etymology

[12076-12091]
arrive two or three days before birth in that realm. Without signs, where one takes rebirth is known through their own karma—death-time visions of hell-fire, hunger-thirst fears, confused awareness, or visions of previous human realms, mountains, oceans, god-palaces, gardens, or dawn-like appearances.

Emaho!

[12081-12105]
The duration of practice should be moderate. Too short, and you make no progress. Too long, and you exhaust yourself. Many short sessions are better than a few long ones. Find your own measure.

[12086-12100]
: "bar" means between above-below, before-after; "do" means holding extremes together like a connecting cord—like a pillar's middle binding cord.

Emaho!

[12101-12120]
: common and uncommon. Some common vehicles consider birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo, etc. But uncommon Secret Mantra King here distinguishes: nature-abiding bardo, death-point bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo—four.

Appearances' modes

[12106-12130]
Above all, maintain the recognition of your own nature. This is the life-force of the practice. Without this, you are merely staring into space. With this, every display becomes the path to awakening.

Emaho!

[12121-12150]
: for three realms generally, afflictions manifest as grasping-fixation. For six realms specifically: gods see nectar in water, humans see water, pretas see pus—one substance, different minds. From Two Truths: "Mind differs, therefore single entity appears as unrealized."

Individual persons

[12131-12155]
You who have entered this path of thod rgal, you are most fortunate. In these degenerate times, such teachings are rare. Do not waste this opportunity!

[12151-12160]
—one person seen as enemy and friend by different people; happiness-suffering, confusion-non-confusion, attachment-aversion, good-bad, dharma-undharma all appear variously. Future karma's good-bad operates through diverse cause-effect.

In short

[12156-12180]
The buddhas of the past practiced thus and awakened. The siddhas of India and Tibet practiced thus and attained rainbow bodies. You too can achieve this if you practice with diligence and devotion.

[12161-12180]
: whatever appears to anyone is like good-bad various dreams—though appearing, unestablished, they appear in empty clarity. Nature-abiding bardo's appearance

[12181-12205]
The key points are few: recognize your own nature, rest in that recognition, and let the displays arise and liberate naturally. Do not complicate things with too many concepts. The nature of mind is simple—keep it simple.

[12181-12200]
: five aggregates' bondage obscures five kayas' appearance; elements and sense-bases obscure light and color; karma and afflictions obscure wisdom and dharmata.

This is

[12201-12220]
the four reversals' difficult-to-cross river whirlpool, day-night circling in various karma and habitual patterns.

Emaho!

[12206-12230]
When you see the lights and forms, remember—they are your own face. When you see the pure lands, remember—they are your own mind's display. When you see the buddhas, remember—they are your own wisdom manifesting. There is no other buddha than your own awareness.

[12221-12240]
: body's elements disturbed, experiencing outer body's suffering; mental events' path lost, experiencing inner mind's suffering; habitual grasping's dam burst, experiencing this life's appearance's separation though attached; remembering non-virtuous deeds, fearing fall into lower realms.

Grasping-fixation's attachment

[12231-12244]
Some say thod rgal is only for those with high faculties. This is not entirely true.

[12241-12244]
remembers cherished supported body, fearing the collapse of the aggregates' fortress—who experiences this?
