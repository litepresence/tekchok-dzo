Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals appearance wisdom. First, from Thalgyur: appearance wisdom explained—earth, water, fire, wind, space from, wisdom appearance wondrous, Bhagavan lord touch-nonexistent. Emptiness itself from that: analyzed not-found wisdom, three realms skin-flesh cut from, five doors' attachment object continuum ceased.

[18610-18620]
This old practitioner once sought visions of wisdom lights. He fasted, meditated, recited mantras—until one day he saw the morning sunlight on dewdrops and realized the five lights were never separate from ordinary perception. The earth beneath his feet was already the wisdom earth.

[18620-18631]
Voice 20 proclaims: Moon and jewel lapis light, whoever wish produce, grasp-arise body appearance grasp. Great Perfection's essential point know from, wisdom by-beyond sky like, all conception dedication-free. Wondrous marvelous wisdom: before nonexistent, after nonexistent, primordially nonexistent, now conception object beyond, extreme-free empty nature.

[18631-18641]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Word transcended, intellect-free, essence empty. Nature wherever not divided, compassion deed not appear. Wisdom appearance three from, intellect arising wisdom confusion rain grasp. This limitless observation end, not-existing not-illuminate arisen play from, Buddhas fruit obtain.

[18636-18659]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. Outer inner all dharma-dimension, this anything not appear. Third, object wisdom: form etc. object five self-liberated gone, appearance four's dharma-nature increasing obtained. From that: object wisdom explained—form sound distinction from, learn taste also five become, knowledge taste exhausted appearance, increase show waxing moon like.

[18650-18670]
This old hermit watched the sun rise over the mountains. The light was not created by his eyes, nor by the sun alone, nor by their meeting—it simply appeared. So too with wisdom appearance. Not inner, not outer, not both. Like trying to catch sunlight in a net—the net is never full, yet light is everywhere.

[18659-18680]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Appearance each taste, object wisdom explained—warmth, measure, sign from, two truths joined conception end exhausted, action nonexistent characteristic empty, expression basis ceased extreme not abide, outflow exhausted therefore heap-possess not, recollection source ceased essence clear, clear rig object end not think, sound-free authentic word nonexistent.

[18670-18695]
Between clarity and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. Wisdom appearance is not a vision to be seen, but the nature of seeing itself. Like the eye that cannot see itself, wisdom cannot be objectified. Yet it is never absent—every perception is wisdom's display.

[18680-18700]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: From Self-Arisen: what arise appearance—all dharmas appearance, do not abide three times, no think no remember, not knowable not viewable, beyond mind expression limit, inconceivable inexpressible, not know not see, non-awareness like, do not observe essence, not think dharma-dimension.

[18695-18720]
This old practitioner once asked his teacher, "Where is wisdom?" The teacher pointed to a teacup. "Is wisdom in the cup?" "No." "Is wisdom in the tea?" "No." "Is wisdom in you seeing the tea?" "No." "Then where?" The teacher drank the tea. Understanding arose—not in words, but in the drinking itself.

[18720-18745]
Voice 20 proclaims: Wisdom not in body, speech, mind. Wisdom not separate from body, speech, mind. Like the moon reflected in water—the moon is not in the water, yet the reflection appears. This is the great mystery of wisdom appearance. Not existing, not non-existing, yet vividly present.

[18740-18765]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: Appearance wisdom is the self-liberation of perception. When form is seen as empty, and emptiness appears as form, this is wisdom's play. Not rejecting appearance, not grasping emptiness—the middle way free from extremes.

[18760-18780]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't seek wisdom in special experiences. The sound of rain, the sight of a bird, the touch of wind—these are wisdom appearance. The extraordinary is hidden in the ordinary. Recognition is the key—not transformation, not achievement, just seeing what has always been.
