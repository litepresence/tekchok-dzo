A wandering fool...

Voice 20 proclaims: Moon and jewel lapis light, whoever wish produce, grasp-arise body appearance grasp. Great Perfection's essential point know from, wisdom by-beyond sky like, all conception dedication-free. Wondrous marvelous wisdom: before nonexistent, after nonexistent, primordially nonexistent, now conception object beyond, extreme-free empty nature.

[18631-18641]
See your own face.

[18636-18659]
The framework reveals...

[18650-18670]
This old hermit watched the sun rise over the mountains. The light was not created by his eyes, nor by the sun alone, nor by their meeting—it simply appeared. So too with wisdom appearance. Not inner, not outer, not both. Like trying to catch sunlight in a net—the net is never full, yet light is everywhere.

[18659-18680]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Appearance each taste, object wisdom explained—warmth, measure, sign from, two truths joined conception end exhausted, action nonexistent characteristic empty, expression basis ceased extreme not abide, outflow exhausted therefore heap-possess not, recollection source ceased essence clear, clear rig object end not think, sound-free authentic word nonexistent.

This mountain hermit...

[18720-18745]
Voice 20 proclaims: Wisdom not in body, speech, mind. Wisdom not separate from body, speech, mind. Like the moon reflected in water—the moon is not in the water, yet the reflection appears. This is the great mystery of wisdom appearance. Not existing, not non-existing, yet vividly present.

[18740-18765]
Thus. We proceed...

[18760-18780]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't seek wisdom in special experiences. The sound of rain, the sight of a bird, the touch of wind—these are wisdom appearance. The extraordinary is hidden in the ordinary. Recognition is the key—not transformation, not achievement, just seeing what has always been.

[18765-18785]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who wait for wisdom to appear! "When will I see the five lights?" they ask. Fools! The light by which you ask is the five lights. The awareness that questions is the wisdom. Stop waiting. Start recognizing.

[18770-18790]
Accordingly. The analysis...
