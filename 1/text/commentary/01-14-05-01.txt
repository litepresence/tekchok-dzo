See directly: Thus established. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[18610-18620]
This hermit realized: A wandering fool. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[18620-18631]
Voice 20 proclaims: Moon and jewel lapis light, whoever wish produce, grasp-arise body appearance grasp. Great Perfection's essential point know from, wisdom by-beyond sky like, all conception dedication-free. Wondrous marvelous wisdom: before nonexistent, after nonexistent, primordially nonexistent, now conception object beyond, extreme-free empty nature.

[18631-18641]
Cut through now! See your own face. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[18636-18659]
Look now: The framework reveals. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[18650-18670]
This old hermit watched the sun rise over the mountains. The light was not created by his eyes, nor by the sun alone, nor by their meeting—it simply appeared. So too with wisdom appearance. Not inner, not outer, not both. Like trying to catch sunlight in a net—the net is never full, yet light is everywhere.

[18659-18680]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Appearance each taste, object wisdom explained—warmth, measure, sign from, two truths joined conception end exhausted, action nonexistent characteristic empty, expression basis ceased extreme not abide, outflow exhausted therefore heap-possess not, recollection source ceased essence clear, clear rig object end not think, sound-free authentic word nonexistent. Rest in this understanding.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[18670-18695]
Between clarity and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. Wisdom appearance is not a vision to be seen, but the nature (rang bzhin) of seeing itself. Like the eye that cannot see itself, wisdom cannot be objectified. Yet it is never absent—every perception is wisdom's display.

[18680-18700]
Sudden recognition! Analysis proceeds. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

[18695-18720]
Thus established: This mountain hermit. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[18720-18745]
Voice 20 proclaims: Wisdom not in body, speech, mind. Wisdom not separate from body, speech, mind.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Like the moon reflected in water—the moon is not in the water, yet the reflection appears.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. This is the great mystery of wisdom appearance. Not existing, not non-existing, yet vividly present.

[18740-18765]
Between these extremes: Thus. We proceed. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[18760-18780]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't seek wisdom in special experiences. The sound of rain, the sight of a bird, the touch of wind—these are wisdom appearance. The extraordinary is hidden in the ordinary. Recognition is the key—not transformation, not achievement, just seeing what has always been.

[18765-18785]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who wait for wisdom to appear! "When will I see the five lights?" they ask. Fools! The light by which you ask is the five lights. The awareness that questions is the wisdom. Stop waiting. Start recognizing.

[18770-18790]
This very moment— Accordingly. The analysis.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
