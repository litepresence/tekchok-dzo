The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
The teaching opens like a door that was never closed. What enters? Only what was already inside. The words are fingers pointing at a moon that has never been absent.

This old practitioner once spent a season watching mountains. They did not move. Neither did I.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[9-12]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The teaching is not what is taught.

The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[29-32]
