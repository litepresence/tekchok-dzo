[1-4]
The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
The teaching opens like a door that was never closed. What enters? Only what was already inside. The words are fingers pointing at a moon that has never been absent.

[5-8]
An old traveler...
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[9-12]
What knows these words?
Ripening is not transformation. It is recognition of what was always ripe.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[13-16]
Between the extremes, the vast middle way opens like a horizon that recedes as you approach.
The sun ripens all fruits without choosing. Its light asks nothing.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[17-20]
Like lightning illuminating the valley for an instant—such is the nature of direct recognition.
The empowerments are rain falling on different soils. The rain is the same. The flowering differs.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[21-24]
Consequently...
The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[25-28]
This cave dweller...
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[29-32]
The sequence completes itself, not by reaching an end, but by recognizing there was never a beginning. Return to what you never left. Rest in what has never moved. The commentary ends where the teaching begins—in the space between thoughts where thoughts have never been.

[33-36]
Thus established...

[33-38]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who rush through teachings like travelers hurrying to a destination! They miss the flowers along the road. Each word is a flower. Each phrase is a scent. Stop and smell the dharma.
