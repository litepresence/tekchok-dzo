Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me: "Here's the punchline of dzogchen: essence has no dharma to hold onto." He opened his empty hands. "Even 'buddha' becomes just a word, pointing at nothing you can grasp." He smiled. "The view and meditation aren't something you measure—they're the natural appearance of samsara and nirvana themselves. No characteristics to pin down, no positions to defend." This old practitioner spent decades defending positions. Debated scholars, wrote treatises, built a fortress of correct views. One morning he woke up and couldn't remember why. The fortress became his prison.

[3915-3925]
He tore it down brick by brick. Liberating! And exhausting. But necessary. Afflictions? When you see them clearly, they release themselves. They don't need your rejection. Acceptance and rejection—both dissolve when there's no one holding either side. This is the path beyond paths: when the very idea of walking toward enlightenment is exhausted. This yogi once walked for three years to reach a sacred mountain. Arrived exhausted. The mountain was just a mountain. The walking was the sacred. Longchenpa speaks of the "gtar-ka"—that membrane, that veiling, that translucent barrier between you and the view.

[3926-3940]
When it clears, there's no longer samsara here and nirvana over there. The boundary was always just confusion. Clear seeing and the confusion it dissolves? Same energy. Not two. This old practitioner spent years trying to clear the gtar-ka. Finally saw: the trying was the gtar-ka. Now he breaks it down into view, meditation, and conduct—and you need to understand what "heat" (gtum mo) means here. It's not sexual energy. It's not some mystical force. It's the burning intensity of non-distraction. When view becomes hot, samsara and nirvana fuse like water mixing with water.

[3926-3940]
When you stabilize that heat, the distinction between them vanishes like an army dispersing when the enemy is gone. For meditation: the movement is gathering—wind and mind condensing like entering a treasure house. The attainment is finding the path. The stability is empowerment itself—like a lineage holder receiving transmission. This yogi once thought stability meant not moving. Sat like a rock for months. Finally his teacher said: "Even rocks move. The earth moves. Find the movement that doesn't move."

[3941-3949]
Conduct brings the outer display. When it's active, you see the knowing reach out like garuda spreading wings. When stable, the three bodies are fully present—not as concepts but as total engagement. This old practitioner once tried to display conduct. Acted wise, acted compassionate, acted enlightened. Everyone saw through it. Especially him. Notice the pattern: view purifies the view, meditation purifies the meditation, conduct purifies the conduct. No external antidote. No purification of something other than itself.

[3941-3949]
That's dzogchen in a nutshell. You don't fix mind. You recognize mind never needed fixing. Whatever appears—mind doesn't conceptualize it because there's no separate mind to do the conceptualizing. This yogi spent years trying to stop conceptualization. Finally gave up. The giving up was the stopping. This practitioner returns to the punchline: no dharma to hold onto. This is scary! We want something solid, something real, something we can trust. But the teaching says: even buddhahood is empty. Even emptiness is empty.

[3926-3940]
Where do you rest? Nowhere. Everywhere. Both. Neither. The mind reels. Good. Let it reel. The reeling is also empty. Heat, or gtum mo, in view and meditation. This is the yogic heat, the inner fire. But Longchenpa uses it metaphorically too. The heat of recognition. The burning away of distraction. When view is hot, you can't be distracted. Samsara and nirvana fuse—not because you make them fuse, but because the distinction was always artificial. Like hot and cold water mixing. No more hot, no more cold. Just water.

[3941-3949]
Conduct is where it gets tricky. You have to act in the world. Can't just sit in a cave forever. But how to act without grasping at action? Without creating karma? The answer: let conduct self-purify. Don't try to be good. Don't try to be compassionate. Just act. The action knows itself. The conduct completes itself. This old practitioner tried to be compassionate. Tried so hard! Failed so often. Finally stopped trying. Compassion happened naturally. The gtar-ka clears. This is the moment of recognition. The membrane between you and the view dissolves.

[3941-3949]
But don't make this into an event! It's not something that happens once and you're done. It happens again and again. Every moment of recognition clears the gtar-ka a little more. Until eventually, there's no membrane at all. Never was. This hermit thought he had "broken through" once. Celebrated. Then saw: another membrane. And another. The breaking through is endless. That's the practice. This practitioner summarizes: view beyond existence and non-existence. Meditation without acceptance or rejection. Conduct without clinging to purity or impurity. Result without grasping at attainment.

[3915-3949]
These four are one. Practice one, you practice all. Practice none, all are complete. This is Dzogchen. This is Atiyoga. This is the great perfection that was never imperfect, the great completion that was never incomplete. Rest there. Not doing view, not doing meditation, not doing conduct. Just resting in what's already uncontrived. This old practitioner still forgets this daily. But he remembers more quickly now. That's the only difference between "beginner" and "advanced"—speed of remembering. Both are equally empty.

[3926-3940]
This hermit returns to the heat, the gtum mo. The burning intensity of practice. Not physical heat. Recognition-heat. The fire of non-distraction. When this burns, samsara and nirvana are seen as one. The separation was always conceptual. The division was always artificial. Like dividing water into hot and cold. It's all just water. This is the Dzogchen view. This is Atiyoga. The direct recognition of the nature of mind.

[3941-3949]
Conduct self-purifying. This is the secret. You don't purify conduct. Conduct purifies itself. Just act naturally. Just respond to circumstances. Without planning. Without strategizing. Without trying to be good or avoid being bad. This is the conduct of the yogi. The conduct of the realized one. But don't imitate it! Don't try to act like a realized person. That just creates more confusion. Just act as you are. Eventually, the acting and the actor dissolve. Only action remains. Only conduct. Self-purified.

Emaho! View, meditation, conduct, result—all just labels on what cannot be labeled. Rest in the unlabeled. Speak the unspeakable. Live the unlived life. Die the undying death. This is Dzogchen. This is the great perfection. This is your own nature, recognized. Emaho!
