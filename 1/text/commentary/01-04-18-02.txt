Second vital point expanded: dharmata's expanse from greatness, nothing not included, so calculating samsara-nirvana's scope; dharmata emptiness without fixation, so calculating thing's change; without action in expanse, so self-arisen wisdom called. This hermit spent years trying to "reach" the expanse. Finally saw: the trying was already in the expanse. The reaching was already what he sought. The expanse isn't somewhere else. It's not a state to achieve. It's the nature of all seeking, all reaching, all trying.

[3900-3906]
Third vital point: own-position all dharmas' source, clear, special cutting. Guru's pith instruction, all teachings' source, clear, cutting through obscurations. Nature: without distinction, so samsara-nirvana single ground; confusion completely pure, so characteristics without confusion cause; three realms ejected. This is the view. This is the meditation. This is the conduct. See everything as pure. See confusion as wisdom. See samsara as nirvana. Not as philosophy. As direct recognition.

[3907-3914]
The four circles: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed secret. Outer: afflictions don't need to be abandoned, so five poisons as path, abiding without effort, emptiness undivided. Inner: non-material, so signless dharmata; without coming-going, so always abiding wisdom. Secret: recognition and attainment simultaneous, so hearing-contemplation-meditation without dependence; breathing stops and Buddhahood simultaneous, so effort and habituation without dependence. Unsurpassed secret: not depending on words, so wisdom without dependence; direct seeing, so examination-grasping view not abiding. This old practitioner describes these from memory. Can't say he's mastered them. But he's tasted each. The taste remains.

[3915-3921]
Outer circle: afflictions as path, effortlessness, emptiness undivided. This is the beginner's Dzogchen. Not that you indulge afflictions. But you don't reject them either. You see them as the path. As wisdom's display. As emptiness's play. This hermit tried this. Failed often. Succeeded sometimes. Both are the path. The failure is the path. The success is the path. Everything is the path when seen clearly.

[3922-3928]
Inner circle: non-material, signless, always abiding. Going deeper. Less emphasis on outer form. More emphasis on inner nature. Signless means no signs to grasp. No experiences to seek. No states to achieve. Always abiding means always present. Not coming. Not going. Not changing. This is the nature of mind. This is what we seek. What we seek is what seeks. The circle completes itself.

[3929-3935]
Secret circle: recognition and attainment simultaneous. This is the advanced Dzogchen. No gradual progress. No stages to traverse. Recognition is attainment. Attainment is recognition. Hearing, contemplation, meditation—not separate practices. All one practice. All one recognition. Breathing stops and Buddhahood simultaneous. Not literal stopping of breath! But the breath of grasping stops. The breath of seeking stops. And Buddhahood is recognized as always present.

[3936-3942]
Unsurpassed secret: not depending on words. Beyond all teachings. Beyond all instructions. Direct seeing without examination. Without grasping at view. This is the completion. The end of the path. The recognition that there was never a path. Never a traveler. Never a destination. Just—this. Just—what is. The unsurpassed secret is not secret because it's hidden. It's secret because it can't be told. Can't be taught. Can only be recognized.

[3943-3949]
This practitioner summarizes: vital points of Dzogchen. Not techniques. Not methods. Recognitions. Direct seeing. Natural resting. The wind in the channels. The expanse of dharmata. The thigle in self-abiding. The four circles. All pointing to the same. All empty. All necessary. All to be transcended. This is the path. This is the fruition. This is the great perfection. Emaho!
