[3950-3967]
Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go. Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables.

Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable: hope does not reach anywhere. Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere. Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.

When divided, there are two: concealing one, revealing and emerging two; concealing two, revealing and emerging one.

[3950-3967]
Without cause and fruition—not that actions have no results, but that the nature (rang bzhin) of action and result is empty. Without self-wish—the spontaneous nature has no agenda. No place to go—because there is no one to go, nowhere to arrive.

Not needing familiarization—recognition is not a habit to form. Not depending on other knowables—self-known, self-luminous.

Hidden and manifest both unobtainable. Hope reaches nowhere—because there is nowhere to reach. Doubt is nowhere—because there is nothing to doubt.

The root rotten—not destroyed, but seen through. Like a tree whose roots are found to be empty—was there ever a tree?

[3950-3967]
An old vagabond. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Had many doubts too. Is this right? Is that wrong? The Great Perfection says: doubt is nowhere.

The root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten. Not that I destroy it—just look closely and it's not there. Like looking for the source of a river. Follow it back—where does it begin?

[3950-3967]
See what is. Rest in recognition. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Without cause and fruition. Without self-wish. No place to go.

Hidden and manifest unobtainable. Hope nowhere. Doubt nowhere.

Root rotten.

[3968-3971]
Cut! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

First: If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed—that nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut.

That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside. Without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness.

[3968-3981]
SUDDEN. Concealing and revealing! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed: abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness.

If view is concealed and the other two are revealed: through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly. Awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts.

Second: Concealing two, revealing one.

If meditation is revealed: awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself.

If conduct is revealed: body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā.

If view is revealed: mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point.

[3972-3984]
Fourth: The essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme. Recognition is immediate.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called. Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.

That divided, there are three: speaking in the manner of error's messenger; speaking in the manner of reversing error at its basis; speaking of the bindu brought to its own vital point.

[3972-3984]
Three ways the teacher speaks: The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. This is the treasury's heart.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Error's messenger—using the student's confusion as the path. Like a skillful doctor using the disease itself as medicine.

Reversing error at its basis—not treating symptoms, but cutting the root. The root of error is the belief in a self that errs.

Bindu brought to its own vital point—the essence concentrated, brought home. Not spread out, but gathered to the point.

[3979-3992]
The first essence: error's root, ignorance, laid as the basis of saṃsāra in the three realms. That same one pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut. Called "first self-awareness."

Self-nature arising as manifold, through the messenger of cause and condition pursuing. The focus on objects severed, saṃsāra and error's basis exhausted—causeless emptiness, primordially pure.

Through error being self-purified in characteristic, the path of error's knowledge is exhausted.

[3985-3992]
Liberate! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Three manners of cutting error:
Cutting error at the root, reversing the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
Leaving error to itself, recognizing the dharmatā of non-error.
Embracing the basis of error, cutting the stream of error's wheel.

[3989-3992]
SUDDEN. First essence! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Error's root—awareness that is the same, knowing itself as self-liberated—primordial error that is not experienced, seal obtained, beyond error and impurity.

Self-nature as different error, the measure of all imagination obtained, beyond object and subject.

Knowing error as error, the heat and measure of non-error obtained!
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.
