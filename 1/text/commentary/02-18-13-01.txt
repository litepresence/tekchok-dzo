When path-vision exhausts near, mandalas complete

[5273-5274]
. Measure is first from half-body until body mandala complete [5275] - arriving means from that, exceeding place not existing, form-vision like full moon

[5276-5277]
, waxing increase ceasing, mandala complete, self-essence not fabricated [5278].

Second, measure three particular explained: outer vision, inner body measure, secret awareness measure

[5279-5282]
. First: vision control lands, light-clear complete [5283]. The Thalgyur says: "Thus from arriving complete measure, direct entity-vision cease, earth stone vision melt, self-know whatever enter"

[5285-5289]
.

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your own body becomes the mandala! Emaho!

[5308-5310]
.

Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets, dharma all know wisdom dawns

[5311-5312]
. Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure, self-vision sambhogakaya complete, mind defilement pure, dust doubt separation itself obtains

[5313-5314]
. Ground and ground latencies self-pure, the Thalgyur declares [5315].

Measure-arrive body also thus becomes [5316], individual body dust free-from, intermediate-space light star-window vision

[5317-5318]
. Then light-ray hook shape, subtle and coil-through vision hold

[5319-5320]
. Body dust self-ceases, copper-shining stainless light body

[5321-5322]
. Center A mark, urna light-ray fathom one measure

[5323-5324]
, crown-uspa wind-by lift vision [5325].

Peaceful-body hand finger from light garland form coil

[5326-5327]
, sound-not mind activity [5328], head skull palace heruka manifest arises

[5329-5330]
. This time self-body measure-to arrives, copper-shining body three one coil

[5331-5333]
.

Third, secret awareness measure: subtle coarse move mind pure although, all-ground consciousness only mind exists

[5334-5336]
. Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawns [5337] - this itself from!

Thus practitioner, your body is the mandala, your mind is the wisdom! Emaho!

[5339-5342]
. Measure-not Buddha realms and thus body also mind-to vision

[5343-5344]
. Empty mind-to defilement exhaust, nature not-move empty-clear obtain, unmixed equal-complete expanse-to pervade, manifest clear-through many separate-not, part not-exist elaboration-not

[5345-5350]
.

That-also vision above two-to affliction-mind and mind-consciousness defilement manifest become purify-from, this obtain time collections eight first seven pure-from

[5351-5352]
. Subtle coarse defilement-from free, body mind connection cut-from

[5353-5354]
. Outer vision object awareness-to vision, investigate agent consciousness part all-ground consciousness power-by self-condition do

[5355-5356]
.

Star-arrow sky-to move measure-like momentary investigate agent self-dawn that self-free antidote separate-to not-look pure [5357]. Vision above two time-at wind outward throw and inward not hold-from, conceptuality moment two-in not abide ability purify cause arise

[5358-5359]
. Body copper-shining, consciousness all-ground part concept-not object awareness fire-spark emit like clear-vivid

[5360-5361]
.

Outer extending vision and inner self-vision vision aspect two see-through body mind separate cut [5362]. Realms three-to outward not return ground supreme mandala great accomplish [5363]. Again Thalgyur from: "Thus vision time all-to, body mind connect cut, contaminated exhaust body-from also, outward arise characteristic clear mind, star-arrow emit manner-by also, sky realm-to clear see"

[5364-5370]
.

That itself first time all-to, wind and separate pure-from also, effort and pure wind action, body-from outward throw cause arise

[5371-5374]
. See agent two part-from also, body light-clear pure-to, mind fire-spark emit like, one-to not abide self-clear basis

[5375-5378]
. Vision aspect two manner-from arise, this-by body mind connect cut-from, realms three return not

[5379-5381]
.

This time-at see agent also all-ground consciousness part star-arrow or fire-spark emit like and, awareness compassion wisdom part two exist-from

[5382-5384]
. See object outer inner two see wisdom part-to arise. This time-at antidote intentionally gaze manner set etc. not, always dharmata wheel-from not pass-from, practice measure complete by-say

[5385-5388]
.

Dear one, your mind and body separate naturally - do not fear! Emaho!

[5392-5393]
. That-from moon waning like, again body that fade-from bindu-to reach etc. first mind-to certain vision

[5394-5396]
.

That container contents arise abide destroy empty four sequence-through vision four purify manner-to meaning sequence apply [5397]. Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass [5477]. Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain [5478]. All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from [5479].

Path dharma exhaust result by-say [5480]. That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace [5481]. Thalgyur from: "Self-Buddha cease dharmata, element cease-from dust cease, dust and particle end cease-from, part merely also abide not, affliction cease-from delusion and, concept-free attachment not abide-from, latency and all-from arise, dust part merely also not abide, thus subtle coarse cease-from, aggregate five also end gradual subtle, element four body exhaust-from, all wisdom Sambhogakaya, concept-free samadhi self-abide, fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from, dharma by-say word-to not abide"

[5429-5476]
Listen, fortunate one! Experience increase etc. vision not arising from exhaust also exists—this mind supreme instantaneous! Before purifying action potential, respect guru—from others merely exhaust manner exists.

Second nature extensive explained: Essence, definition, nature, dharmata, boundary—five aspects. Dharmata exhaust essence: outer light five vision body together exhaust, inner dust together concept aggregate together exhaust, experience vision object exhaust, primordially-pure vision sky-like manner awareness abides—thal 'gyur! Dharmata exhaust vision, experience vision from empty, body exhaust sense object also exhaust, concept aggregate delusion-from free, express basis word and separate—thus!

Definition: Dharma by body speech mind aggregate dharma affliction together, itself purify agent path vision luminosity meditate part together. Exhaust is empty—mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist, not observe by-say! Thus dharmata certain definition: Dharma know aggregate gather-to, action do and characteristic hold, self-vision empty do-to, individual families hold, itself fabricate not-exist-to, natural abide-through real pervade, unfabricated original continuous-to, sound word name number exhaust—thus!

Nature: outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity—rtsal rdzogs! This time exhaust characteristic, action-free sky like thus—thus!

Dharmata two: vision dharmata—outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust, that exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust!

Emaho! Dharmata exhaustion of all phenomena!

[5482-5498]
.

Empty dharmata - channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust

[5499-5500]
. Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from [5501]. Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express [5502].

Again before from: "Cause and result dharmata, conceptuality coarse source cease-from, memory self-pure continuum-from also, dependent-arising wind itself fully-pure, cause-from arise dharmata, primordial-from pure nature-to, one and many number exhaust, body and wisdom not-exist and, dharmas exhaust ground arrive, result dharmata is think"

[5503-5513]
.

Dear practitioner, all dharmas exhaust into the ground - this is the result! Emaho!

[5516-5520]
Listen here, you who think Dzogchen is complicated philosophy! Longchenpa now addresses your intellectual tendency to create contradictions where none exist. He's about to smash your conceptual thinking with simple, direct truth!

"Fruit's primordial purity without body and wisdom—heart-essence misreading arises!" Do you understand what this means? You try to separate primordial purity (*ka dag*) from its natural expressions - body and wisdom. But Longchenpa says they're inseparable! Like trying to separate fire from heat!

"Outer appearance resonance body and wisdom crystal-light inwardly returned like portion, thus said, meaning not understood merely!" Oh, how students love to analyze! You think Longchenpa is giving complex doctrinal points. But he's saying: When you over-intellectualize, you miss the direct experience!

"Actually, inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence; uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished contradicts..." Longchenpa is listing all the logical contradictions you create when you try to understand primordial purity through concepts!

[5525-5540]
Such contradictions - listen carefully! "Uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished" - this is what happens when you think time is linear! "Inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence" - this happens when you separate ground from path!

But here's the crucial point: Longchenpa says "Such faults accepting not suitable!" Why? Because these aren't real intellectual problems to be solved - they're symptoms of conceptual mind trying to grasp what's beyond concepts!

[5540-5542]
Listen here, dear practitioner! This delusion-vision's vision appears like a mirror's reflection. That own body also like water-moon—wisdom illusory body, self-vision zinc-tin, free from elements' harm, vajra body obtained! For sentient beings' benefit, called arising as body of great transference!

[5541-5548]
Now, after destroying your intellectual errors, the master gives the actual teaching: "Fifth boundary: measure-arrived curtain from exhaustion beginning time, own four legs' fingers light five clear merely existing..."

This isn't some complex visualization technique! The "measure-arrived curtain" isn't something to practice - it's the natural display when awareness recognizes its own completeness. The "four legs' fingers light" aren't special powers - they're how your innate capacity expresses itself!

Emaho! Stop trying to understand primordial purity and just recognize it directly!

[5543-5548]
Others' impure eye, from merely stone-with zinc-tin not seen. Great master Vimala and Padma likewise! Then birth and entering, two powers obtained. Even instant Buddha, duration exists. Until samsara not emptied, doing sentient beings' benefit, also freedom power!

[5549-5556]
Birth power is: entering dharmadhatu, putting rigpa into three thousand beings, all liberated at one time—great power obtained! Insects also dive into light! Birth power obtained, whatever desired emanated, spontaneously doing sentient beings' benefit!

Do you see? Your body is the vajra body! Not seen by impure eyes, but for those with pure vision—mirror-like, water-moon-like! You have the power of birth and entering. Use it for beings!

Emaho! Vajra body of great transference!

[5567-5568]
.

This focus element self cease, birth and enter difference-by

[5569-5570]
. Dharma all exhaust self ground-to, what also hold not

[5571-5572]
. Abide is emanation body, this-by enter power control

[5573-5574]
. Birth self-power who obtain, that also that-to focus-from

[5575-5576]
.

Again time thus do time, vision self-sound rustling, manifest reverse delusion vision, this-by beings benefit all do

[5577-5580]
. Awareness equal one cause, thousand three beings, transfer great this accomplish

[5581-5583]
. Thus gradual and instantaneous, body this-by accomplish

[5584-5585]
.

That all body exhaust measure-from free, this all result certain

[5586-5587]
. Ground supreme mandala great accomplish [5588]. Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say [5590]. Example ladder rung like, that also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease

[5591-5592]
.

Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist [5593]. Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from [5594]. Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from, dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do

[5595-5596]
.

That itself-to Buddha accomplish desire person-by, this means possess thus thus

[5597-5598]
. Other conduct pride do itself is-from, entity see not

[5599-5600]
. That cause this all rare word, always jewel treasure this look

[5601-5603]
.

Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise [5604].

Dear practitioner, these teachings are rare jewels - treasure them! Emaho!

[5606-5609]
Listen, dear practitioner! Three unmoving body establishes the base. Three bindings take measure. Three obtainings give pointing. Four confidences show liberation measure!

[5610-5619]
From Spontaneous Liberation: "There make extreme reliance and faith. Three unmoving base established, wind-mind arrived at key point! Three abidings measure taken, dream reverse and body, speech, mind—signs and measure certainly taken!"

[5620-5633]
From Jewel Garland: "Three unmoving confidence place, self-nature path exhausted! Confidence remaining not, doubt self-liberated. Confidence again not, hope and fear released. Confidence path not, effort spontaneously accomplished!"

[5634-5639]
Also from same: Three unmoving, three abidings, three obtainings—these are not techniques! They are recognition of what already is.
