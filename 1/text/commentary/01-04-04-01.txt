[2836-2843]
The Bodhisattva vehicle—this is where compassion meets wisdom. This hermit first thought they were separate paths: first gain wisdom, then help others. Like building a house before inviting guests. But the truth is, the house and the invitation arise together.

[2844-2855]
The essence: wishing to liberate all beings while realizing there are no beings to liberate. This is the paradox that drives conceptual mind crazy. Like trying to catch water in a net—the harder one tries, the more it slips through. The Bodhisattva doesn't solve the paradox but lives it.

[2856-2870]
The conduct: taking the precepts—eight for lay practitioners, hundreds for monks and nuns. This old practitioner remembers his first vows, trembling with sincerity, determined to keep them perfectly. Now he sees: the keeping and the breaking are both conventional. What matters is the intention, the bodhicitta behind the action.

[2871-2885]
The generation of bodhicitta through the practices of aspiration and engagement. Aspiration: may all beings be happy. Engagement: I will make them happy. The first is easy, like wishing for rain during drought. The second is hard, like carrying water to every thirsty plant.

[2886-2895]
The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment: four mindfulnesses, four abandonings, four legs of miraculous powers, five faculties, five powers, seven branches of enlightenment, eightfold path. This hermit once memorized them all like a merchant counting his goods. Now he sees they are not possessions but descriptions of a natural unfolding.

[2896-2914]
The result: reaching the stage of Universal Light, obtaining the two Buddha bodies for self and others' benefit, the two wisdoms knowing what is and how much. This is the complete awakening, not partial, not gradual, but sudden recognition of what was always present. Like waking up and realizing the dream was just a dream.
