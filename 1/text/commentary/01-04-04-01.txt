First: all phenomena of samsara and nirvana gathered into two truths. This is not philosophical abstraction. This is the structure of experience itself. The world you perceive—conventional. The nature of that perception—ultimate.

[2837-2842]
As Mūlamadhyamakakārikā states: Buddhas taught Dharma relying on two truths. Conventional truth of world. Ultimate truth of meaning. The Buddha did not teach one truth to beginners and another to adepts. He taught both simultaneously. Like showing a mirror and what it reflects.

[2844-2846]
From Magical Illusion Net Tantra: One abides in the manner of two truths. Abides. Not analyzes. Not understands. Abides. The tantra does not say "one understands two truths." It says abides. This is crucial. Abiding is recognition. Understanding is conceptual.

[2847-2848]
Phenomena marked by characteristics appearing as objects of intellect—conventional truth. Divided into false and true conventional. This distinction matters. False conventional: appearances that deceive. True conventional: appearances that function while being empty. Like a useful dream.

[2837-2848]
This old practitioner spent years confused about two truths. He thought conventional was false and ultimate was true. Wrong! Both are true in their own way. Conventional truth is true conventionally. Ultimate truth is true ultimately. Neither negates the other.

[2847-2848]
The false conventional: phenomena arranged by intellect, container world and contained beings, all appearing as external objects. Like a dream where you believe the dream is real. The true conventional: same phenomena recognized as dependently arisen, functional, yet empty. Like a dream where you know you are dreaming.

[2847-2848]
Between the false and true conventional, the entire spiritual path unfolds. From believing appearances are inherently real, to recognizing they are dependently arisen, to realizing they are primordially pure. This is the progression. This is the Vehicle of Characteristics at work.

[2847-2848]
The Treasury presents two truths not as philosophical position but as direct pointing. Conventional truth: look at your experience. Ultimate truth: recognize its nature. Both point to same reality. Two fingers. One moon.

[2847-2848]
This practitioner warns: do not make two truths into two realities. They are two perspectives on one reality. Like seeing water as drinkable and seeing water as H₂O. Same water. Different knowledge. Neither negates the other.

[2836-2848]
Therefore. Thus. All phenomena gathered into two truths. Conventional: appearances as they seem. Ultimate: nature as it is. The path moves from confusion about conventional, to correct understanding of conventional, to transcendence of both conventional and ultimate. This is the journey.
