Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to divide the world into true and false, conventional and ultimate, day and night. He sat there with his frozen butter lamp until the distinctions melted like spring snow. This old practitioner watched him do it. The categories? They're like the yak's horns—useful for distinguishing one yak from another, but don't try to ride them. The two truths are not two separate realities. They are two ways of looking at one reality. The conventional truth is how things appear to the confused mind. The ultimate truth is how things actually are. But don't think the ultimate is somewhere else, some other realm you need to reach. It's the nature of this very appearance. The dream is empty while you're dreaming, not just when you wake up.

[2839-2842]
Listen! This is not philosophical dualism! It is practical pedagogy. The Buddha meets beings where they are, speaking conventionally to those who need it, pointing ultimately to those who can receive it. Like a grandmother who speaks differently to her grandchildren—same love, different words. Some yogi once tried to speak ultimate truth to a merchant worried about his horses. The merchant walked away confused. Speak to beings in their own language, or don't speak at all. The conventional truth is the language of the world. The ultimate truth is the recognition beyond language. But you need language to get beyond language. That's the paradox. That's the path.

[2848-2849]
The conventional has two divisions: false and true. The false conventional is all imputed appearances arranged by intellect—the world you create through conceptual construction. You see a table, you name it "table," you believe in the table as truly existing. This functions! You can eat on it, work on it. But when analyzed, where is the table? In the wood? The wood is also imputed. In the atoms? The atoms are also conceptual. Everything dissolves under analysis like frost in morning sun. This is the Madhyamaka critique. Not that things don't appear, but that they don't appear as they seem. They seem solid, independent, real. They are actually dependent, empty, like dreams.

[2850-2861]
Yet the false conventional is not nothing. It appears, it functions, it has consequences. Like a debt in a dream—you still suffer until you wake. The eight similes of illusion show this: dream, illusion, city of gandharvas, reflection, echo, mirage, water-moon, magical creation. All appearing, none existing as they appear. This hermit once chased a mirage for three days thinking it was water. When he finally reached it, he was too exhausted to be disappointed. That's when he understood. The suffering wasn't from the mirage not being water. The suffering was from thinking it was water, from running toward it, from the desperation and thirst. The recognition that it's a mirage doesn't make it disappear. But it changes your relationship to it.

[2862-2869]
True conventional is virtuous phenomena—ten good deeds, six perfections, path of seeing and meditation. These produce results: good rebirth, liberation. They function conventionally while being ultimately empty. Like medicine that cures the illness but has no inherent nature. The medicine works! But don't worship the pill. This old practitioner spent years collecting pills, thinking more pills meant more health. His teacher dumped them all in the river. "Now," she said, "you can begin to heal." The true conventional is the path. It's necessary. But it's not the goal. It's the finger, not the moon. It's the raft, not the shore. Use it wisely. Don't cling to it.

[2867-2869]
The path of virtue is conventional but necessary. It's like building a boat to cross the river. The boat is empty of inherent existence—you won't find "boat-ness" in any plank or nail—yet it carries you across. Don't abandon the boat while still in mid-stream. But don't carry it on your back once you've reached the other shore. This yogi still sees practitioners carrying their boats, showing them off, comparing whose boat is better. All drowning together. The ten good deeds, the six perfections, the paths and stages—they're all boats. Beautiful boats! But boats nonetheless. When you reach the other side, leave them for the next traveler. Or burn them for warmth. Don't make them into monuments.

[2844-2861]
The eight similes of illusion appear in the Root of Wisdom Sutra for a reason. The Buddha knew we need concrete images to understand emptiness. A dream is vivid while it lasts. An echo sounds real. A mirage shimmers like water. None are what they appear to be, yet all function within their own context. The dreamer eats dream-food and is satisfied. The one who hears the echo responds to it. The thirsty traveler runs toward the mirage. Only upon waking, hearing clearly, or reaching the spot does the illusion become apparent. But here's the key: the illusion was always an illusion. It didn't become an illusion when you recognized it. Recognition changes you, not the illusion. This is crucial to understand.

[2836-2848]
The division between conventional and ultimate is itself conventional! This is crucial to understand. The Buddha didn't discover two separate realities. He taught two ways of looking at one reality. Like seeing a mountain from the valley and from the peak—same mountain, different views. The valley view is valid for the valley dweller. The peak view is valid for the one who climbed. Neither is wrong. Both are limited by perspective. The one who has seen both understands more than either view alone. This is why the two truths are taught—to help us move from the valley view to the peak view, from confusion to recognition.

[2862-2869]
Virtue and non-virtue function conventionally. This is why ethics matter even in emptiness. Some fools hear "all is empty" and think they can do whatever they want. They don't understand: the emptiness of actions doesn't mean actions have no results. It means the actions, the actor, and the results are all interdependent, lacking independent existence. The karmic law functions like a dream law—while dreaming, you can't jump off a cliff and fly just because you know it's a dream. The dream-gravity still applies. You still hit the bottom. The dream-pain still hurts. So practice virtue! Accumulate merit! But don't grasp at it. Don't make it into a possession. That's the subtle trap.

[2849-2856]
Wrong conventional is every imputed appearance arranged by intellect. This is the world of the confused—the world where things appear solid, permanent, independent. We all live here most of the time. The table is just a table, the self is just a self, the world is just the world. Nothing to question, nothing to investigate. This is comfortable! Like sleeping in a warm bed. But comfort becomes imprisonment when we refuse to wake up. The Buddha's teaching is the cold splash of water on the dreamer. Unpleasant! But necessary. The two truths are the alarm clock. The path is getting out of bed. Liberation is realizing you were never asleep.

[2837-2848]
This old practitioner returns to the teaching on the two truths again and again. Not because he hasn't understood it, but because each understanding is deeper. First, he understood it intellectually—conventional equals relative, ultimate equals absolute. Then he understood it experientially—seeing through the solidity of objects in meditation. Then he understood it naturally—living the two truths without thinking about them. Now? He doesn't understand at all. And that's the deepest understanding. The two truths are not a philosophical system to master. They are a finger pointing at the moon. Eventually, you have to look at the moon. Eventually, you have to forget the finger. This is the way.

[2844-2861]
This hermit returns to wrong conventional one last time because it's where we all start. The world of imputed appearances—names, labels, concepts, beliefs. This is not wrong! It's necessary. We need language to communicate. We need concepts to navigate. We need beliefs to function. The problem is not the imputation. The problem is believing the imputation is the reality. Thinking the name is the thing. Thinking the map is the territory. Thinking the concept captures the truth. This is the fundamental confusion. The two truths are the remedy—not by eliminating imputation, but by seeing through it. Using it without being trapped by it. Living in the world without being of the world.

Emaho! False and true, both conventional, both empty, both necessary. Don't get stuck in either. Don't reject either. This is the Middle Way—not the middle between two extremes, but the way that transcends extremes entirely. The way that includes both conventional and ultimate, both appearance and emptiness, both form and void. Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form. This is not poetry. This is the nature of reality. Look and see for yourself. Don't believe this old hermit. Don't believe anyone. See directly. That's the only way. Emaho!
