First: all phenomena of samsara and nirvana gathered into two truths. This is not philosophical abstraction. This is the structure of experience itself. The world you perceive—conventional. The nature of that perception—ultimate.

[2837-2842]
As Mūlamadhyamakakārikā states: Buddhas taught Dharma relying on two truths. Conventional truth of world. Ultimate truth of meaning. The Buddha did not teach one truth to beginners and another to adepts. He taught both simultaneously. Like showing a mirror and what it reflects.

From Magical Illusion Net Tantra: One abides in the manner of two truths. Abides. Not analyzes. Not understands. Abides. The tantra does not say "one understands two truths." It says abides. This is crucial. Abiding is recognition. Understanding is conceptual.

Phenomena marked by characteristics appearing as objects of intellect—conventional truth. Divided into false and true conventional. This distinction matters. False conventional: appearances that deceive. True conventional: appearances that function while being empty. Like a useful dream.

The false conventional: phenomena arranged by intellect, container world and contained beings, all appearing as external objects. Like a dream where you believe the dream is real.

The Treasury presents two truths not as philosophical position but as direct pointing. Conventional truth: look at your experience. Ultimate truth: recognize its nature. Both point to same reality. Two fingers. One moon.

[2847-2848]
This practitioner warns: do not make two truths into two realities. They are two perspectives on one reality. Like seeing water as drinkable and seeing water as H₂O. Same water. Different knowledge. Neither negates the other.

[2836-2848]
Thus. We proceed...

[2840-2842]
See what is.

A meditation master once told his student: "The cup you hold is conventional. Its emptiness is ultimate. But tell me—which do you drink?" The student sat with this for three years. One morning, drinking tea, he laughed. The tea was teaching him what the master could not.

[2847-2848]
Between the two truths lies the entire path. Not in the truths themselves but in the movement from one to the other. From confusion to clarity. From grasping to release. From dreaming to waking. This movement is not gradual—it is the flicker of recognition itself.
