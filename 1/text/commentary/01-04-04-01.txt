[2836-2848]
First: all phenomena of samsara and nirvana gathered into two truths. This is not philosophical abstraction. This is the structure of experience itself. The world you perceive—conventional. The nature of that perception—ultimate.

[2837-2842]
As Mūlamadhyamakakārikā states: Buddhas taught Dharma relying on two truths. Conventional truth of world. Ultimate truth of meaning. The Buddha did not teach one truth to beginners and another to adepts. He taught both simultaneously. Like showing a mirror and what it reflects.

[2844-2846]
From Magical Illusion Net Tantra: One abides in the manner of two truths. Abides. Not analyzes. Not understands. Abides. The tantra does not say "one understands two truths." It says abides. This is crucial. Abiding is recognition. Understanding is conceptual.

[2847-2848]
Phenomena marked by characteristics appearing as objects of intellect—conventional truth. Divided into false and true conventional. This distinction matters. False conventional: appearances that deceive. True conventional: appearances that function while being empty. Like a useful dream.

[2837-2848]
This yogi. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[2847-2848]
The false conventional: phenomena arranged by intellect, container world and contained beings, all appearing as external objects. Like a dream where you believe the dream is real. The true conventional: same phenomena recognized as dependently arisen, functional, yet empty. Like a dream where you know you are dreaming.

[2847-2848]
Between the false and true conventional, the entire spiritual path unfolds. From believing appearances are inherently real, to recognizing they are dependently arisen, to realizing they are primordially pure. This is the progression. This is the Vehicle of Characteristics at work.

[2847-2848]
The Treasury presents two truths not as philosophical position but as direct pointing. Conventional truth: look at your experience. Ultimate truth: recognize its nature. Both point to same reality. Two fingers. One moon.

[2847-2848]
This practitioner warns: do not make two truths into two realities. They are two perspectives on one reality. Like seeing water as drinkable and seeing water as H₂O. Same water. Different knowledge. Neither negates the other.

[2836-2848]
Thus. We proceed. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[2840-2842]
See what is. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[2844-2848]
A meditation master once told his student: "The cup you hold is conventional. Its emptiness is ultimate. But tell me—which do you drink?" The student sat with this for three years. One morning, drinking tea, he laughed. The tea was teaching him what the master could not.

[2847-2848]
Between the two truths lies the entire path. Not in the truths themselves but in the movement from one to the other.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. From confusion to clarity.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. From grasping to release. From dreaming to waking. This movement is not gradual—it is the flicker of recognition itself.

[2848]
A practitioner. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[2836-2848]
Accordingly. The analysis.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.
