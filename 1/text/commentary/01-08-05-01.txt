Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the non-dual basis. Spontaneous presence exists as depth-clarity within the essence of primordial purity. Like the sun's heart radiating light without ever leaving its core, awareness of primordial purity is not established as thing or mark, while the natural expression of spontaneous presence dwells as subtle inner clarity. The essence of appearance is empty; the nature of emptiness dwells clear. Form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, dwell like the heart of the sun—single in essence, manifold in rays.

This old practitioner spent twenty years trying to separate ka dag from lhun grub, like trying to separate water from wetness. Foolish! The primordially pure essence and spontaneously present nature are non-dual from the very first. The crystal ball holds the rainbow; the rainbow adorns the crystal. Neither comes first, neither exists alone. When the cloud of separation dissolves, the sky of non-duality appears.

[10759-10765]
Between essence and nature, the vast middle way opens like a lotus. The Rangshar tantra speaks: The basis is spoken of as having two aspects—the basis of great primordial purity, and the basis of variegated spontaneous presence. Two names for one reality, like calling water both H2O and the ocean. Thus it is said, and thus it is.

[10761-10769]
From Klongdrukpa: The essence itself is primordially pure; the nature is spontaneously accomplished. This is not philosophy but description of what is. The mirror's nature is to reflect; without reflection, there is no mirror. Without mirror, no reflection. Which comes first? Neither—they arise together, dwell together, liberate together.

[10770-10773]
From Mu Tig Phreng Ba: The essence is primordially pure, free from the basis of expression; the nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears. Words fail here. Concepts exhaust themselves. The more you try to capture it, the more it slips away. Like trying to hold water in a net—only the wetness remains.

[10774-10781]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues. Abandoning disputes regarding that has two parts: number and one's own face. The dispute: critics say if primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual as eighth basis, this contradicts the seven bases already refuted. The response: one holds them as non-dual, thus one does not turn away from the gathering of the seven—there is no fault of following as an eighth. This does not contradict "one's own face is primordially pure"—because one holds the essence to be primordially pure, there is connection.

[10777-10781]
This old hermit remembers debating a scholar from the lowlands. "You claim non-duality," he said, "but you speak of two—ka dag and lhun grub. Is this not contradiction?" I laughed and held up a coin. "Is this one or two? One metal, two faces. Without both, it is not a coin." He went away scratching his head. Some truths must be laughed into understanding.

[10781-10790]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Second dispute! If the essence were exclusively primordially pure without spontaneous presence, samsara would not exist as other than purity—it would be unreasonable for sentient beings' confusion to ever arise! Conversely, because the nature is held as merely spontaneous presence without primordial purity, whoever accepts this follows that one is primordially liberated without any effort. It follows that they contradict each other when posited as separate substances—a fundamental problem requiring resolution!

[10786-10797]
The answer: because the essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in samsara as real entities. From the power of spontaneous presence as merely the play of the path, appearing like that does not contradict primordial purity—the two are non-dual. Just as when going to sleep, though dreams do not exist in the own-face of awareness, appearances of horses and oxen appearing to the dreamer does not contradict the empty nature of sleep. The dream is both empty and appearing—non-dual.

[10790-10799]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: Though sentient beings appear to deluded perception, because the meaning of the essence is not established merely through the play of illusion, they are primordially liberated. When horses and oxen appear through the power of mantra to the eye in conventional appearance, manifesting as liberation to pure perception—because the nature dwells in its own place without effort, reverting spontaneously like a child's ball that returns when thrown. From the ultimate aspect of emptiness and conventional aspect of appearance, those two are not separate substances—they do not contradict.

[10798-10829]
From Klongdrukpa tantra: Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature. Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva. Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing in the field. The bodhisattva asked: If the nature itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete, are these sentient beings reasonably self-liberated? The Teacher responded: Because primordially spontaneously accomplished from the beginning. He spoke in response: These sentient beings, because the essence is primordially pure without stain, liberations also appear as play without contradiction.

[10815-10825]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: The bodhisattva's question is already the answer! To ask about self-liberation is to miss that liberation is not a thing to be obtained. The question assumes bondage. The answer dissolves the questioner.

[10820-10835]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: The Teacher's response is not philosophical but direct pointing. Don't analyze the words. Receive the transmission. The tantra speaks to be heard, not dissected. Listen with the ear of recognition.

[10830-10840]
This old hermit offers final teaching: The bodhisattva's question and the Teacher's answer are like two hands clapping. The sound is not in either hand alone. Recognition is the sound of non-duality.
