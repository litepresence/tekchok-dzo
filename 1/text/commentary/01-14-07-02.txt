[19405-19406]
Consequently...

[19405-19406]
This wanderer...

[19405-19406]
Voice 20 proclaims: The light threads are wisdom's natural ornament. They appear to those with pure vision, like rainbows appearing to those who look at the sky after rain. Don't chase the threads; recognize the light that produces them.

[19405-19406]
What knows these words?

[19407-19412]
Thus established...

[19410-19420]
This old hermit watched light dance on water at sunset. The threads of light shimmered, moved, yet were always just light on water. So too with wisdom light threads—they appear to move, appear to change, yet are always the same display of awareness.

[19420-19430]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who chase light threads like children chasing butterflies! They exhaust themselves and catch nothing. The threads appear to beginners as signs of progress. To the advanced, they are just another appearance. To the realized, they are the nature itself showing its face.

[19425-19435]
Between seeking and finding, the vast middle way opens. The light threads neither exist nor don't exist. They appear to pure perception as spontaneously present. They are not created by practice, not destroyed by non-practice. Like reflections in a mirror—they appear, yet change nothing.

[19435-19450]
The framework reveals...

[19445-19460]
This hermit...

[19460-19470]
Voice 20 proclaims: The light threads connect all appearances like a web connecting dewdrops. Each thread is separate, yet all are one web. This is the nature of dependent arising—distinct yet interconnected, many yet one.

[19470-19480]
Wake up. Now.

[19475-19485]
Analysis proceeds...

[19480-19495]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Enough with threads! The fabric is the teaching. The space is the teacher. The recognition is the student. All three are one. Don't separate what has never been divided!
