[2539-2570]
Sravakayana. The vehicle of hearers. Four noble truths. Twelve links of dependent origination. No-self of person. This is precise analysis. Useful medicine for the disease of self-grasping.

[2540-2550]
A practitioner once spent ten years practicing Sravaka meditation. He analyzed the aggregates. He saw their impermanence. Their suffering. Their emptiness of self. He became an arhat. He was free from samsara. But he had not recognized rigpa. He was free from the prison but had not discovered the palace.

[2545-2555]
The Sravaka path is valid. The results are real. Freedom from rebirth in the three lower realms. Freedom from gross suffering. But it is not the final freedom. It is a step. A necessary step for many. Do not despise it. Do not stop there.

[2556-2570]
Four noble truths in detail. Suffering. Cause of suffering. Cessation of suffering. Path to cessation. This is Buddha's first teaching. Still relevant. Still true. But incomplete without the recognition of the nature of mind.

[2560-2570]
The suffering of suffering. The suffering of change. The suffering of conditioning. Three types analyzed precisely. This is not pessimism. This is clear seeing. The Sravaka sees clearly. But sees only part. Like someone who sees the prison clearly but does not see they hold the key.

[2571-2600]
Twelve links of dependent origination. Ignorance creates formations. Formations create consciousness. Consciousness creates name-and-form. Name-and-form create six senses. Six senses create contact. Contact creates feeling. Feeling creates craving. Craving creates grasping. Grasping creates becoming. Becoming creates birth. Birth creates aging and death. The wheel turns.

[2580-2590]
This practitioner once traced these links backward. He tried to find the first cause. He never found it. Finally he saw: the search itself was ignorance. The one who searched was ignorance. The links were links of water. Solid when frozen. Gone when melted.

[2591-2600]
No-self of person. The person is empty of inherent existence. Analyzed precisely: not the aggregates, not separate from aggregates, not in aggregates, not aggregates in person. The chariot and its parts. Valid analysis. Liberating analysis. But incomplete.

[2601-2650]
The Sravaka does not realize no-self of phenomena. They stop at person-empty. This is not wrong. This is their path. They achieve liberation from samsara. But they do not recognize the nature of all phenomena. They are free from the thicket of views but have not seen the viewless.

[2620-2635]
Between the Sravaka's analytical precision and the Dzogchen's direct recognition, we find the path's stages. Not rejecting the Sravaka. Going beyond. The Sravaka medicine cures the fever of self-grasping. Then Dzogchen reveals the patient's true nature was never sick.

[2636-2650]
This old practitioner honors the Sravakas. Their discipline. Their analysis. Their results. But he does not stop there. The Treasury calls us further. Beyond vehicles. Beyond analysis. To direct recognition. This is the path of Longchenpa.

[2651-2700]
The Sravaka path is like climbing a mountain to escape a flood. You reach safety. You are saved. But you have not seen the view from the peak. The Treasury invites us to the peak. Not by rejecting the climb. By completing it. By going further.

[2670-2680]
Devotional recognition. Even in the Sravaka path, devotion opens doors. Devotion to the Buddha. To the Dharma. To the Sangha. This practitioner feels that devotion. It is valid. It is beautiful. But it is not the final devotion—the devotion that is recognition itself.

[2681-2700]
The Treasury synthesizes all. The Sravaka's discipline. The Pratyekabuddha's independence. The Bodhisattva's compassion. The Tantric's skill. The Dzogchen's recognition. All are here. All are honored. All are transcended. This is the vast view.

[2701-2832]
Rest in that vast view. Do not cling to Sravaka as final. Do not reject it as inferior. Both are conceptual proliferations. Liberate them. The Sravaka path is a finger pointing. The finger is not the moon. Look at the moon.
