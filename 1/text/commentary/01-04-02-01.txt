[2539-2548]
The vehicle of hearers—this hermit began there, wanting escape for himself alone. Like a man trapped in a burning house who thinks only of his own exit, not of others still inside. The Sravaka hears the teaching, cultivates renunciation, achieves peace. But is it complete? Like finding a cave in winter—warm, safe, but not a home.

[2549-2560]
The Vaibhasikas analyze the aggregates, dividing experience into smallest parts. They say conventional truth is like a heap of stones—each stone real, the heap merely a name. This practitioner once counted moments of consciousness like a miser counting coins, thinking quantity would reveal quality.

[2561-2575]
They establish four truths: suffering, origin, cessation, path. Like a doctor diagnosing disease—this is the illness, this is the cause, this is the cure, this is the treatment. But who is the patient? Where is the self that suffers and is cured? They say it is merely the aggregates, yet cling to those aggregates as if they were something.

[2576-2585]
The Sautrantikas say the twelve sense bases are the objects of knowledge. They purify afflictions, realize supreme wisdom. But this hermit asks: who purifies? What is purified? If mind is momentary, flashing in and out of existence like lightning, what persists to do the purifying?

[2586-2595]
Both schools accept no-self of person but cling to self of phenomena—atoms, moments, dharmas. Like prisoners who remove one chain but keep another. They are free from the gross delusion of ego, but bound by the subtle delusion of things. This old practitioner knows that trap well. He lived there for years.

[2596-2605]
The Pratyekabuddha is different. He understands dependent origination without hearing it from another. Like a man who discovers fire by rubbing sticks together, not because someone taught him. Solitary, silent, dwelling in forests. This hermit admires the independence, but questions the isolation.

[2606-2615]
The rhinoceros-like practitioner—rhinoceros because he goes alone, not with a herd. Self-taught, self-liberated. But this yogi wonders: can one truly liberate oneself? Is there a self to do the liberating? The very notion of self-liberation implies a self, a doer, an achiever.

[2616-2630]
The Hinayana paths share a limitation: they aim at personal peace, personal liberation. Like travelers who reach an oasis and camp there forever, never continuing to the destination. The water is sweet, the shade is cool, but it is not the journey's end. This old practitioner camped at that oasis for too long.

[2631-2645]
They abandon afflictions, achieve cessation, but do they realize the nature of mind itself? Do they recognize that the one who abandons and what is abandoned are not two? This hermit says: their view is correct but incomplete. Like seeing one face of a jewel but not the whole.

[2646-2660]
The realization of no-self of person is genuine. It frees from samsara's grip. But without realizing the emptiness of all phenomena, without the compassion that naturally arises from seeing all beings as one's own mind, the awakening is partial. Like a lamp that lights only one room of a house.
