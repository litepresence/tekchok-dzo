[3870-3876] The first: through emptiness's great pervasion, without depending on the path of all-pervading action, when distinguishing ground as superior, words for the basis of elaboration don't even conventionally exist. Elaborator unspeakable, inexpressible dharmatā—no letters. Reasoning of action's causelessness ejects saṃsāra and extracts past studies.

[3877-3882] The second: dharmatā's abiding aspect, mind unchanging; three kāyas appearing as path, nothing unliberated; result reaching essential point, dharmatā meeting mother. Word-essence: free of conceptual grasping, natural conceptual grasping exhausted, characteristics free of dualistic identification.

[3883-3887] Word divisions: words for distracted fools thrown to distraction; words when circumstances strike without time—pedagogical responsiveness, not doctrinal positions. Extracting dharmatā from source is pointing-out instruction, not philosophical extraction.
