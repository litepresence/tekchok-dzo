Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me he had transcended all words. "I need no teachings," he said. "I am beyond words." I asked him: "What did you just say?" He stared at me for three days. Finally he laughed. "The words that say there are no words are still words." This old practitioner nodded. "Now," I said, "you're getting close." The first: through emptiness's great pervasion, without depending on the path of all-pervading action, when distinguishing ground as superior, words for the basis of elaboration don't even conventionally exist. Elaborator unspeakable, inexpressible dharmata—no letters.

[3870-3876]
This yogi spent ten years studying letters. Learned five languages. Could read any text. Then his teacher took away all his books. "Now," she said, "read the sky." Reasoning of action's causelessness ejects samsara and extracts past studies. This old practitioner had years of study extracted like a bad tooth. Painful! But the relief afterward—indescribable. The studies weren't wrong. The clinging to them was the problem. The second: dharmata's abiding aspect, mind unchanging; three kayas appearing as path, nothing unliberated; result reaching essential point, dharmata meeting mother.

[3877-3882]
Word-essence: free of conceptual grasping, natural conceptual grasping exhausted, characteristics free of dualistic identification. This yogi once tried to exhaust conceptual grasping by fighting it. Like trying to exhaust fire by adding fuel. Finally he stopped fighting. The grasping exhausted itself. Word divisions: words for distracted fools thrown to distraction; words when circumstances strike without time—pedagogical responsiveness, not doctrinal positions. Extracting dharmata from source is pointing-out instruction, not philosophical extraction.

[3883-3887]
This old practitioner gives pointing-out instructions. Some students grasp the words. Some grasp beyond words. Both need further pointing. The first section: cutting through elaboration. Words for the basis of elaboration don't even conventionally exist. What does this mean? It means the concepts we use to construct reality—self, other, time, space—have no ultimate basis. They're useful fictions. Tools. Don't mistake the tools for the house. This hermit used words as bricks. Built elaborate structures. Lived in them. Comfortable prisons.

[3877-3882]
Dharmata meeting mother. This is a phrase from Atiyoga. The "mother" is the ground, the basis. Dharmata meets its own nature. Recognition recognizing itself. Not two things meeting. One thing recognizing itself as one thing. This old practitioner spent years looking for this "meeting." Finally saw: nothing was ever separate, so no meeting was needed. Words for distracted fools. This sounds harsh! But it's compassionate. Some minds need elaborate teachings. Need philosophy, need logic, need structure. Give them what they need! But don't think the elaborate teachings are superior.

[3883-3887]
The elaborate and the direct both point to the same. Like a highway and a mountain path—both lead to the summit. Different travelers need different routes. This hermit gives pointing-out instructions. Direct, simple, cutting through. Some get it. Some don't. Those who don't need more words. More elaboration. More preparation. That's fine. Meet them where they are. Eventually, everyone gets the direct pointing. Eventually, everyone sees through words.

[3870-3876]
This hermit returns to the beginning. "I am beyond words." The statement contradicts itself. But the contradiction is the teaching! You can't say you're beyond words using words. But you also can't remain silent if someone asks for help. So you speak, knowing speech is limited. You teach, knowing teaching is incomplete. This is the bodhisattva's vow—entering the world of words to lead beyond words. It's a paradox. It's a mystery. It's the only way.

[3877-3882]
The three kayas appearing as path. Dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—not separate places or states. They're how the display appears from different perspectives. From the perspective of no perspective—Dharmakaya. From the perspective of enjoyment—Sambhogakaya. From the perspective of manifestation—Nirmanakaya. All three are always present. Just recognized or not. This old practitioner spent years trying to reach the Dharmakaya. Finally saw: he was already there. Always had been. The seeking was the only obstacle.

[3883-3887]
Extracting dharmata from source. This is the pith instruction. Direct pointing. Not building up concepts, but cutting through them. Like extracting a thorn with a thorn. Using words to go beyond words. This old practitioner gives these instructions. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. The working and not-working are both the path. The words and the silence are both the teaching. Don't prefer one over the other. Use both. Transcend both.

[3870-3876]
This practitioner returns to the first section again. No words for elaboration. This is the highest teaching. But you can't start here. You need words to reach wordlessness. You need concepts to reach conceptlessness. The path is gradual, even when the recognition is sudden. Build the foundation. Then demolish it. This is the way. This is the Dzogchen path. This is Atiyoga.

[3877-3882]
The second section: dharmata meeting mother. Recognition of recognition. The ground recognizing itself. This is the essence of Dzogchen. Not something new. Something old. Something always present. Just recognized. Just seen. The three kayas appearing as path—this is how the recognition manifests. As Dharmakaya, as clarity. As Sambhogakaya, as enjoyment. As Nirmanakaya, as compassion. All three are one. One is all three.

[3883-3887]
Word-essence and word-divisions. The essence is freedom from grasping. The divisions are pedagogical. Different words for different minds. This hermit uses many words. Then uses none. Both are teaching. Both are pointing. The pointing is the same. Only the words change. Don't get attached to the words. Don't get attached to the silence. Rest in the nature that includes both.

Emaho! Words, no words, beyond words—just more words until they're seen through. The finger points. The moon shines. Don't confuse them. Don't prefer one over the other. Use words to reach wordlessness. Use concepts to reach conceptlessness. Then rest in what was always there. The nature of mind. Clear and empty. Luminous and free. Beyond all words, yet perfectly expressed by all words. This is the mystery. This is the Dzogchen path. Emaho!
