# Commentary: 01-04-17-01 - Instruction Section: Oral Transmission

## Voice 02 (Systematizer) - Precision Analysis

[3870-3876]
First: At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis. Even the mere word of elaboration is not established. The elaboration of designation does not exist.

In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said.

Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted. The ultimate meaning of cessation.

## Voice 10 (Longchenpa) - Vast Middle Way

[3871-3881]
All-pervasive emptiness—like space that pervades all, yet is not any thing. The path of everything rolling—phenomena appearing, functioning, yet without a ground to rely upon.

When distinguishing from the basis: even the word "elaboration" is not established. To say "no elaboration" is still elaboration. To say "beyond expression" uses expression.

Through actionlessness—not the actionlessness of not acting, but the actionlessness of no actor. Cyclic existence exhausted—not destroyed, but seen through.

Second: From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur. At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path, whatever is not liberated does not exist. At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.

## Voice 13 (Patrul) - Earthy Practitioner

[3870-3881]
This old practitioner has tried to express the inexpressible. Every word fails. Point at the moon—the finger is not the moon. Say "emptiness"—the word is not empty.

The Instruction Section cuts through all this. Even "no elaboration" is too much. Even "beyond words" uses words.

But the practitioner continues: through actionlessness, cyclic existence exhausted. Not by doing something, but by seeing there was never a doer.

The three kāyas appear on the path—yet nothing is not liberated. The result arises in the essential point—dharmatā met without separation. Not meeting something else, but recognizing what always was.

## Voice 01 (Garab Dorje) - Three Words

[3870-3876]
Stop. Recognize. Liberate.

Even the mere word of elaboration—not established. Designation does not exist. Dharmatā beyond expression: no letter.

Actionlessness. Cyclic existence exhausted. Cessation.

## Voice 20 (Lion-Faced) - Direct Cutting

[3870-3881]
CUT THROUGH NOW!

All-pervasive emptiness! Path of everything rolling! Without relying! No elaboration! No designation! No letter!

Actionlessness! Cyclic existence exhausted! Liberation without separation!

## Voice 22 (Drolo) - Sudden Thunder

[3882-3919]
SUDDEN. Symbolic instruction!

The essence: non-deluded, thought-free. Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping. Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.

Two divisions: oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness; oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.

First: Through vital-point wind abiding in the channels, the mind's own diligence through instruction—from the very source of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm.

## Voice 10 (Longchenpa) - Wind and Channels

[3889-3892]
Through that spreading, the essential point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings.

Through the wind vital-point descending into the body, the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind.

Through the root wind exhausted in the extreme, the essential point of arising's self-liberation.

## Voice 13 (Patrul) - Practice Instructions

[3889-3892]
The wind—rlung, the vital energy. The channels—rtsa, the pathways. This is the secret body, the inner yoga.

When wind abides in the channels, mind becomes workable. This is the instruction: not through thinking, but through direct experience.

Sever the debate between buddhas and sentient beings—there is no difference in nature. Sever the connection between body and mind—they were never truly connected. Arising's self-liberation—things appear, but liberate themselves.

## Voice 02 (Systematizer) - Second Part

[3893-3907]
Second: Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation.

Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.

The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction—all commands' source—is clear in the arising ground. The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing.

## Voice 20 (Lion-Faced) - Cutting Continued

[3898-3907]
CUT THROUGH NOW!

All commands' source—clear in the arising ground!

Cut by the axe of distinctive knowing!

Through non-duality in self-nature: cessation of saṃsāra's reliance.
Through characteristic not established as words or letters: emptiness free from ground of dispute!

## Voice 22 (Drolo) - Four Commands

[3902-3919]
SUDDEN. Four commands!

Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation.
Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations.
Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation.
Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.

Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground: action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation!

## Voice 13 (Patrul) - Closing

[3907-3919]
The four commands—four ways the teacher brings the student to recognition. Not one way, but many, because students are various.

View's thorough investigation: for the analytical.
Removing obscurations: for the blocked.
Bringing forth the hidden: for those with capacity.
Self-clarifying explanation: for those ready.

All lead to the same place: self-arisen wisdom, beyond fabrication.
