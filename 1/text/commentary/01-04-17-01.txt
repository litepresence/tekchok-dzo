Some hermit in a yak hair tent once told me he had transcended all words. "I need no teachings," he said. "I am beyond words." I asked him: "What did you just say?" He stared at me for three days. Finally he laughed. "The words that say there are no words are still words." This old practitioner nodded. "Now," I said, "you're getting close." The first: through emptiness's great pervasion, without depending on the path of all-pervading action, when distinguishing ground as superior, words for the basis of elaboration don't even conventionally exist. Elaborator unspeakable, inexpressible dharmata—no letters.

Word-essence: free of conceptual grasping, natural conceptual grasping exhausted, characteristics free of dualistic identification. This yogi once tried to exhaust conceptual grasping by fighting it. Like trying to exhaust fire by adding fuel. Finally he stopped fighting. The grasping exhausted itself. Word divisions: words for distracted fools thrown to distraction; words when circumstances strike without time—pedagogical responsiveness, not doctrinal positions. Extracting dharmata from source is pointing-out instruction, not philosophical extraction.

[3883-3887]
This old practitioner gives pointing-out instructions. Some students grasp the words. Some grasp beyond words. Both need further pointing. The first section: cutting through elaboration. Words for the basis of elaboration don't even conventionally exist. What does this mean? It means the concepts we use to construct reality—self, other, time, space—have no ultimate basis. They're useful fictions. Tools. Don't mistake the tools for the house. This hermit used words as bricks. Built elaborate structures. Lived in them. Comfortable prisons.

[3888-3892]
Second section: dharmata meeting mother. This is a phrase from Atiyoga. The "mother" is the ground, the basis. Dharmata meets its own nature. Recognition recognizing itself. Not two things meeting. One thing recognizing itself as one thing. This old practitioner spent years looking for this "meeting." Finally saw: nothing was ever separate, so no meeting was needed.

[3893-3899]
The three kayas appearing as path. Dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—not separate places or states. They're how the display appears from different perspectives. From the perspective of no perspective—Dharmakaya. From the perspective of enjoyment—Sambhogakaya. From the perspective of manifestation—Nirmanakaya. All three are always present. Just recognized or not. This old practitioner spent years trying to reach the Dharmakaya. Finally saw: he was already there. Always had been. The seeking was the only obstacle.

[3900-3906]
Extracting dharmata from source. This is the pith instruction. Direct pointing. Not building up concepts, but cutting through them. Like extracting a thorn with a thorn. Using words to go beyond words. This old practitioner gives these instructions. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. The working and not-working are both the path. The words and the silence are both the teaching. Don't prefer one over the other. Use both. Transcend both.
