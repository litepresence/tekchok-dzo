Some hermit in a yak hair tent once asked me: "What is the nature of mind?" I showed him my empty palm. He looked disappointed. "That's it?" he asked. "That's everything," I replied. He stared at his own palm for three days. On the fourth day, he laughed until tears froze on his cheeks. "I see," he said. "There's nothing to see." This old practitioner nodded. The first: not experiencing confusion, ignorance's cause purified; not abiding in present confusion, karma and affliction's basis emptied; future confusion impossible, good-evil karma decided. This is thorough! Every aspect of confusion addressed. Past, present, future—all purified in one moment of recognition. Time is a concept. Liberation is timeless.

Nature without distinction, samsara-nirvana single ground; confusion completely pure, characteristics without confusion cause, three realms ejected. Third essence: falling basis empty, unreached constructed ground; nature beyond calculation, confusion-not-confusion not established; characteristics non-dual, confusion-not-confusion's companion absent. This old practitioner read these words for twenty years before understanding: confusion purified is not confusion removed. It's confusion recognized as empty. Like seeing through a mirage. The mirage doesn't disappear. You just stop chasing it.

[4014-4020]
Third, thigle placed in self-abiding: singular essence free from elaboration, without parts; nature without multiplicity, transcending expression words; characteristic all-pervading dharmata. Through recognition, decisive confidence. Divisions: aural and explanation lineages. Aural: connected one-to-one, close distinction; nature connected to ear faculty, others cannot interrupt, characteristics without wrapping, confidence with liberation certainty.

[4021-4030]
Explanation lineage essence: unreached constructed dharmata, causeless, no basis to transform three realms. Nature: clear light without stain, knowing five wisdoms' characteristics. Characteristics: transcending examination, abiding in three kayas five wisdoms' intention. Divisions: four circles—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed secret. This old practitioner has been in all four. The outer taught him discipline. The inner taught him openness. The secret taught him directness. The unsurpassed secret taught him there's nothing to teach.

[4031-4040]
Outer circle essence: afflictions don't need to be abandoned, so five poisons as path, abiding; without effort, so appearing as dharmata; characteristics without parts, so emptiness undivided anywhere. Inner circle: non-material, so signless dharmata; without coming-going, so always abiding wisdom; characteristics from the root, so arising like root; from rolling aspect, so arising like stem; from clear aspect, so arising like flower; from ripening aspect, so arising like fruit.

[4041-4050]
Secret circle essence: pointing out and attainment simultaneous, so hearing-contemplation-meditation without dependence; nature breathing stops and Buddhahood simultaneous, so effort-accomplishment without dependence; characteristics Buddhahood and compassion simultaneous, so merit-accumulation without dependence. Unsurpassed secret: not depending on words, so wisdom without dependence; nature direct seeing, so examination-grasping view not abiding; characteristics four appearances measure, so result three kayas five wisdoms without dependence.

[4051-4060]
This hermit returns to the beginning. Not experiencing confusion. This is the first point. Confusion is not experienced as something real. It's recognized as empty. As the play of awareness. As the display of mind. This doesn't mean confusion doesn't appear. It means it's not grasped. Not solidified. Not taken as real. This is the beginning of liberation. The recognition that confusion is not the enemy. Confusion is the path. Confusion is wisdom's display.

[4061-4070]
Single ground of samsara and nirvana. This is the highest teaching. Not two different places. Not two different states. One ground, two views. Confused view: samsara. Clear view: nirvana. Same ground. This is Dzogchen. This is the great perfection. This is what all the pointing is about. Recognize the single ground. Rest in the single ground. Be free in the single ground. This is the nature of mind. This is your own nature. Recognize it. Be free. Emaho!
