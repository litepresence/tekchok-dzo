[4096-4150] Those are all gathered into three: Mind Section, Space Section, and Pith Instruction Section. The Mind Section: everything not mind's dharmas don't exist separately—various mind section. These only intend to stop what is other than spontaneously-arisen mind wisdom. Dharmatā Kuntu-Zangmo's space without other destination—space section. These only intend to stop what arises other than expressed dharmatā's space. Natural disposition hitting vital points—pith instruction section. These intend to stop non-vital points gushing elsewhere, arriving at all's pinnacle.

[4150-4178] In these, three assertions don't exceed: ultimately dharmatā's ground-path-result liberation's great perfection. Mind Section: ground-lamp-transformed great perfection. Divisions: various-mind-asserting and mind-side-asserting. Mind-asserting: mind-only truly existent, existence-non-existence stopping—meaning not established as mind-only; mind also not established as mere meaning. Various is mind, not looking; mind not cause or characteristic—not various mind, not even mere existence established. Mind and meaning not established—mere convention not established by mind.

[3626-3650] Through being various, nothing is stopped; through being mind, various also not established—Great Perfection beyond acceptance-rejection. Various appearing yet not exceeding single mind's wheel—understood as various. Mind itself understood as various. Mind-side-asserting: essence appearance-side, mind-side appearance—whatever appears is mind; mind itself spontaneously-arisen wisdom dawning, mind-side's play unceasing self-dawning. Divisions: result-mind-arising, beyond deviation-obscuration, reasoning-disturbance-conjunction, extreme-fall free spontaneously-arisen wisdom, direction-holding entity self-established, philosophical-view mind-free distinction.

[3650-3657] First: dharmatā without change, mind without transformation; spontaneously self-liberated, unconstructed spontaneity, three realms' ground-established, saṃsāra beginningless, end birthless spontaneity ground-settling. Since ground-set, not returning; since self-set, no antidote; effortless, beyond various limit—called spontaneity.

[3657-3661] Second: eight stages intellectually determined basis-deviated dharmas; depending on non-existence side-lying spontaneity, existence side-grasping extreme falls; causeless self-arisen falls—this mere verbal existence, essence mind-free; not constructed causeless self-dawning; unconstructed causeless primordially pure, free from obscuring dharmatā. Deviation also: dharmatā without change from cause; causeless transcending result's basis; obscuration transcending path, karma good-evil without staining—called basis.
