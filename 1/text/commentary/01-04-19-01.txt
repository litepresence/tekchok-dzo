Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to count all the Dzogchen teachings. He had lists, sub-lists, categories within categories. Mind Section, Space Section, Pith Instruction Section—each with their own subdivisions, each with their own sub-subdivisions. His tent was covered in diagrams. This old practitioner visited him one winter. "How's the counting going?" I asked. He looked up, wild-eyed. "I think I have them all!" he said. "Good," I replied. "Now count the snowflakes outside." He looked. Counted three. Gave up. Started laughing. That was his real teaching.

[4096-4150]
Those are all gathered into three: Mind Section, Space Section, and Pith Instruction Section. The Mind Section: everything not mind's dharmas don't exist separately—various mind section. These only intend to stop what is other than spontaneously-arisen mind wisdom. Dharmata Kuntu-Zangmo's space without other destination—space section. These only intend to stop what arises other than expressed dharmata's space. Natural disposition hitting vital points—pith instruction section. These intend to stop non-vital points gushing elsewhere, arriving at all's pinnacle.

[4150-4178]
In these, three assertions don't exceed: ultimately dharmata's ground-path-result liberation's great perfection. Mind Section: ground-lamp-transformed great perfection. Divisions: various-mind-asserting and mind-side-asserting. Mind-asserting: mind-only truly existent, existence-non-existence stopping—meaning not established as mind-only; mind also not established as mere meaning. This old practitioner spent years trying to understand Mind Section. Finally his teacher said: "The mind that tries to understand Mind Section is itself Mind Section. Stop trying to understand and understand completely."

[3626-3650]
Through being various, nothing is stopped; through being mind, various also not established—Great Perfection beyond acceptance-rejection. Various appearing yet not exceeding single mind's wheel—understood as various. Mind itself understood as various. This yogi once thought "single mind" meant one universal consciousness. He was wrong. "Single" here means not two. Not one either. Just—this. Whatever this is. Mind-side-asserting: essence appearance-side, mind-side appearance—whatever appears is mind; mind itself spontaneously-arisen wisdom dawning, mind-side's play unceasing self-dawning.

[3650-3657]
Divisions: result-mind-arising, beyond deviation-obscuration, reasoning-disturbance-conjunction, extreme-fall free spontaneously-arisen wisdom, direction-holding entity self-established, philosophical-view mind-free distinction. This old practitioner doesn't remember all these categories. But he remembers: whatever appears, that's it. No need to categorize. First: dharmata without change, mind without transformation; spontaneously self-liberated, unconstructed spontaneity, three realms' ground-established, samsara beginningless, end birthless spontaneity ground-settling.

[3650-3657]
Since ground-set, not returning; since self-set, no antidote; effortless, beyond various limit—called spontaneity. This yogi once tried to "be spontaneous." Planned spontaneity, practiced spontaneity, studied spontaneity. His teacher laughed for three days. "You're the most deliberate spontaneous person I've ever met." Second: eight stages intellectually determined basis-deviated dharmas; depending on non-existence side-lying spontaneity, existence side-grasping extreme falls; causeless self-arisen falls—this mere verbal existence, essence mind-free; not constructed causeless self-dawning.

[3657-3661]
Unconstructed causeless primordially pure, free from obscuring dharmata. Deviation also: dharmata without change from cause; causeless transcending result's basis; obscuration transcending path, karma good-evil without staining—called basis. This old practitioner has deviated more times than he can count. Each deviation was the path. Each return was also deviation. The path is not straight. Neither is it crooked. The three sections of Dzogchen—Mind, Space, and Pith Instruction. This is how the teachings are organized. But don't mistake the organization for the truth!

[4150-4178]
They're three ways of approaching the same recognition. Mind Section emphasizes mind as primary. Space Section emphasizes the expanse. Pith Instruction emphasizes direct pointing. All lead to the same. Choose the one that fits your mind. Or practice all three. Or none. Mind Section has two divisions: mind-asserting and mind-side-asserting. Mind-asserting says everything is mind. Mind-side-asserting says whatever appears is mind's aspect. Subtle difference! Both are Mind Section approaches. Both lead to recognition.

[3626-3650]
Single mind's wheel. This is a key phrase. All appearances are the play of one mind. But "one" here doesn't mean numerical one. It means non-dual. Not two. The wheel keeps turning—samsara, nirvana, appearance, emptiness—but the mind that knows them is the same. This old practitioner used to look for different minds. Perceiving mind, thinking mind, dreaming mind. Finally saw: one mind, many functions. Like one sun, many reflections. Spontaneity. This is the nature of mind in Dzogchen. Self-liberated, unconstructed, causeless.

[3650-3657]
Not produced by causes, not dependent on conditions. Always already liberated. Always already pure. This is hard to accept! We want to achieve something, become something, transform something. But the teaching says: nothing to achieve, nothing to become, nothing to transform. Just recognize what's already the case. Deviation. This is important! Even in Dzogchen, you can go wrong. How? By grasping at non-existence. By falling into nihilism. By thinking "nothing matters" because everything is empty.

[4096-4150]
This is the worst deviation. This practitioner returns to the counting hermit. He had organized all of Dzogchen into neat categories. Impressive intellectual work! But useless for liberation. The snowflakes taught him what the categories couldn't: you can't count the uncountable. You can't organize the unorganized. You can't grasp the ungraspable. The teaching is meant to be lived, not catalogued.

[4150-4178]
The three assertions don't exceed ground-path-result as dharmata's liberation. This is the Dzogchen view. Ground is already liberated. Path recognizes that liberation. Result is the full manifestation of what was always true. Not a transformation. A recognition. Not an achievement. A remembering. This old practitioner remembers more often now. That's the only difference between now and thirty years ago.

[3626-3650]
This hermit returns to the single mind. Not one mind controlling everything. Not a universal consciousness. Just—the non-dual nature of all experience. The knower and the known are not two. They're the two aspects of one knowing. This is the Mind Section teaching. This is the Dzogchen view. This is the great perfection. Simple. Direct. Profound.

[3650-3657]
This practitioner returns to spontaneity. Unconstructed. Causeless. Self-liberated. These words point to the nature of mind. Not something you create. Not something you achieve. Something you recognize. Something you remember. The ground is spontaneously present. The path is spontaneous recognition. The result is spontaneous manifestation. All three are spontaneous. All three are the same. This is Dzogchen.

[3657-3661]
Deviation and non-deviation. Even in the great perfection, you can go wrong. But the deviation is also perfect. The error is also the path. The confusion is also wisdom. Don't make deviation into a problem. Don't make non-deviation into an achievement. Both are empty. Both are the display. This is the highest view. The view that includes all views. The perfection that perfects all imperfections.

Emaho! Mind Section, Space Section, Pith Instruction Section—three doors, one room. Enter any door. Enter all doors. Enter no door. Same room. Same recognition. Same liberation. The great perfection that was never imperfect. The great completion that was never incomplete. Just this. Just here. Just now. Emaho!
