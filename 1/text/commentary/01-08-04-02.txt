. He speaks of consciousness as momentary, realization as many, affliction as powerful—and how these cannot be the basis. You have spent lifetimes building systems, creating philosophies, arguing about the nature of mind. "Consciousness is momentary!" you cry. "No, it is permanent!" And both sides miss the point. The basis is not consciousness. Consciousness is a wave on the ocean. The basis is the ocean itself, not moved by any wave.

, he shows the faults: basis external-internal consequence, basis grasped-grasper consequence, basis six-collections abandon object one-sided consequence, basis expanse as-one not-tenable because many assembled. You think if you abandon the six collections of consciousness, you will find the basis. But the basis is not an object to be found. You think the expanse is one thing, but how can it be one when many appear? These are conceptual knots you tie yourself in, like a snake coiling around its own body.

, the Six Expanses Tantra scattered spoke, but this side not-tenable, whose essence that appearance, result different meaning that similar, many sound-by deterioration. You cling to one view, then another, and each time you think "This is it!" But every view is a deterioration of the actual state. The essence is not an essence. The appearance is not an appearance. They are not the same, not different. Can you hold that without your mind exploding?

, he speaks of awareness self-arisen's primordial-wisdom, existence-non-existence's extreme from free, primordial-wisdom merely established not, elaboration-free great-bindu's aspect-from anywhere not-established. You want to establish something. You want to say "Awareness exists!" or "Awareness does not exist!" But awareness is free of both extremes. It is not established anywhere. It is like space—can you say space exists? Can you say it does not exist?

, he refutes further. If anything not-established, primordial-wisdom merely-not existence-from pure-by anywhere place-to-put natural-state anything not-exist if samsara-nirvana arise expanse-to contradiction. If primordial-wisdom not-exist, Buddha and sentient-beings's liberation not-exist. You think "If nothing exists, then nothing matters!" But this is not nihilism. The natural state is not a thing that exists or does not exist. It is the ground from which existence and non-existence both arise. Without it, there could be no samsara, no nirvana, no confusion, no liberation.

, he posits his own system: primordially-pure spontaneous-accomplishment non-dual's basis. Essence primordially-pure at spontaneous-accomplishment depth clear exist-by non-dual portion's essence primordially-pure's awareness thing characteristic not-established. You want to know what the basis is? It is primordially pure, yes. It is spontaneously accomplished, yes. But these are not two things stuck together. They are one thing, like water and wetness. You cannot separate them. And in that non-duality, awareness does not have characteristics. It does not have marks. It is not a thing you can point to.

So stop your debating. Stop your analyzing. The basis is not found through logic. It is found through direct recognition. Look at your own mind right now. Is it primordially pure? Does it need to be purified? Is it spontaneously accomplished? Does it need to be accomplished? Rest in that recognition, and let the debaters debate. You have work to do—no work at all.
