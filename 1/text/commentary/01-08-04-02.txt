Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the cascade of errors when multiplicity is posited as the basis. If consciousness is momentary, the basis must follow as momentary—flashing into existence and extinction like summer lightning. This reduces the eternal ground to conditioned arising, the deathless to the dying. If consciousness holds many thoughts and realizations, the basis fragments into innumerable pieces, losing its unity. If consciousness operates under the power of afflictive conditions, the basis becomes tainted, impure, subject to the winds of karma. Three errors, each fatal to the view.

[10724-10729]
This old practitioner has watched scholars tie themselves in knots. They wish to preserve the basis as pure while claiming it is multiple. But multiplicity implies distinction, and distinction implies conditionality. The basis cannot be both conditioned and unconditioned—this is like claiming fire is both hot and cold. Choose your position, but do not straddle the fence!

[10727-10732]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. The basis is not consciousness. Consciousness is conditioned; the basis is unconditioned. Consciousness arises and ceases; the basis neither arises nor ceases. Do not mistake the reflection for the mirror. When you see multiplicity, recognize it as spontaneous display, not as the nature of the ground itself.

[10727-10734]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Third position, fourth position, fifth position—all crumble like sand castles before the tide! If multiplicity is the basis, then the basis becomes external and internal simultaneously—how can one thing be both? The basis becomes grasper and grasped—caught in the dualistic trap it supposedly transcends. The basis becomes the six collections—fragmented, partial, incomplete. This is not the basis but its degradation!

[10729-10732]
CUT THROUGH NOW! Stop counting! The basis is not a number. One, two, three, six, seven—these are fingers pointing. Look at what they indicate, not the counting itself. The six consciousnesses are like six windows in one house—distinct openings, single space within. Do not mistake the windows for the space.

[10730-10741]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Moreover, the basis cannot be held as a single expanse because it is an assembly of many. This is the objection raised against any attempt to unify multiplicity. From the Six Expanses, the Teacher spoke scattered above—his words like stars scattered across the midnight sky. This too, because it does not accord with any side, whose essence is that appearance.

[10732-10741]
Between scattered and gathered, the vast middle way opens. The seven positions are like seven blind men describing an elephant—each touches a part and claims the whole. The faults are endless because the attempts to capture the uncapturable multiply without limit. Are not these knowable dharmas? Yes—and their very knowability is their limitation. What was spoken is just like that.

[10742-10750]
This old hermit sits by the river watching leaves float by. Each leaf is different—some green, some brown, some whole, some torn. Yet all are water, all are leaves, all are floating. The basis is like this—not one leaf, not many leaves, but the floating itself. The seventh position attempts to say the basis is beyond existence and non-existence, but even this becomes a position to be refuted.

[10746-10754]
From Klongdrukpa: If primordial wisdom is not established as anything, being pure from the beginning, is the natural state without anything to place anywhere—if there were nothing, this contradicts being the expanse from which samsara and nirvana arise. If primordial wisdom does not exist, the liberation of Buddhas and sentient beings does not exist. The non-realized mind of delusion is not even possible without the subtle five lights that provide the ground for confusion itself.

[10750-10754]
Because the essence itself is primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted. Thus it is similar to the previous six bases—all positions dissolve when exposed to the light of direct recognition.

[10755-10756]
Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own system. This has two parts: the actual meaning and abandoning disputes regarding that. This is the definitive presentation, the crown jewel of all views, the secret treasury of the Great Perfection.

[10757-10765]
Voice 20 proclaims: The seven positions are like seven mirrors reflecting the same face. Each shows a different distortion, yet each points to the same truth. Don't worship the mirrors. Look at what they reflect.

[10760-10770]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: Establishing the non-dual basis is not creating a new position but dissolving the framework of positions. Like waking from a dream—the dream positions vanish, waking has no position. This is the Great Perfection.

[10765-10775]
This old hermit offers final word: The seven positions are seven rivers flowing to one ocean. Each river thinks it alone carries the water. But the ocean doesn't care which river brings the drop. Rest in the ocean.
