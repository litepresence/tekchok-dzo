Second tier: gods holding flower garlands. What do they hold? Not blossoms plucked from trees. These are the self-arisen ornaments of virtue accumulated. Each petal a moment of generosity, each thread a continuum of discipline. They wear their merit like crowns. But garlands fade. Even celestial flowers wither when the causes that created them exhaust. Look closely at what you hold—how long until it crumbles?

[998-1010]
These gods dwell in the second tier above the first, their garlands more refined, their virtue more accumulated. Yet they share the same fate: impermanence. An old practitioner once meditated on these garland-holding gods. He thought: if celestial merit-flowers fade, what of my own accumulation? Then he laughed. The recognition of fading is itself unfading.

[1011-1020]
Three words that dissolve the garlands: empty appearance. The gods are not holding flowers. They are holding their own projections. The flowers are not real. The holding is not real. The one who holds is not real. Yet the display continues. This is the nature of all realms.

[1021-1030]
Therefore. Thus. The second tier teaches what the first taught: even refined accumulation exhausts. Even celestial virtue disperses. Do not seek stability in accumulation. Seek recognition of the nature that accumulates and disperses.

[1031-1040]
Between the garland-gods and the recognition that transcends all gods, the path continues upward. Not rejecting the garlands. Not grasping them. The ornaments point beyond themselves. Rest in that recognition.

[1041-1050]
This old practitioner has seen many garlands—celestial and human. He has worn merit like ornaments. Now he sees: the wearing itself is the teaching. The ornaments are not the point. The one who wears is not the point. Recognition is the point. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[1051-1060]
CUT THROUGH NOW. The garlands are already faded. The gods are already gone. The second tier is already empty. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. Do not wait for the flowers to wither. See through them NOW.

[1061-1070]
Therefore. Thus. The second tier completes its teaching. The garlands have been offered. The recognition has been pointed to. The path continues upward or nowhere at all. Both are the same. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the tiers.

[1071-1080]
Three words that complete all tiers: awareness itself. The gods are awareness. The garlands are awareness. The holding is awareness. The fading is awareness. The recognition is awareness. Nothing else has ever been. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[1081-1090]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where do the faded garlands go?" The answer came in a vision: nowhere. They were never anywhere. The fading was the teaching. The withering was the blessing. The disappearance was the pointing. He bowed to the empty air where gods had stood.

[1091-1100]
Therefore. Thus. The second tier is complete. The garlands have completed their teaching. The gods have completed their display. The practitioner has completed his recognition. All complete, yet nothing was ever incomplete. Rest in that completion.

[1101-1110]
CUT THROUGH. The second tier is not a place. It is a state of mind. The garlands are not ornaments. They are thoughts. The gods are not beings. They are projections. Cut through all of it NOW. Rest in awareness.

[1111-1120]
This old practitioner has nothing more to say about garlands. He has seen them come and go. He has worn them and lost them. Now he rests where there are no gods, no garlands, no tiers—only awareness displaying as all of it. Go. Recognize. Rest.

[1121-1125]
Three words: awareness complete. Enough.
