Second tier: gods holding flower garlands. What do they hold? Not blossoms plucked from trees. These are the self-arisen ornaments of virtue accumulated. Each petal a moment of generosity, each thread a continuum of discipline. They wear their merit like crowns. But garlands fade. Even celestial flowers wither when the causes that created them exhaust. Look closely at what you hold—how long until it crumbles?

[998-1010]
These gods dwell in the second tier above the first, their garlands more refined, their virtue more accumulated. Yet they share the same fate: impermanence. An old practitioner once meditated on these garland-holding gods. He thought: if celestial merit-flowers fade, what of my own accumulation? Then he laughed. The recognition of fading is itself unfading.

[1011-1020]
Look. It is here.

[1021-1030]
Thus. We proceed...

[1031-1040]
Between the garland-gods and the recognition that transcends all gods, the path continues upward. Not rejecting the garlands. Not grasping them. The ornaments point beyond themselves. Rest in that recognition.

[1041-1050]
This old man once...

[1051-1060]
Cut through.

[1061-1070]
Accordingly. The analysis...

[1071-1080]
Recognize immediately.

[1081-1090]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where do the faded garlands go?" The answer came in a vision: nowhere. They were never anywhere. The fading was the teaching. The withering was the blessing. The disappearance was the pointing. He bowed to the empty air where gods had stood.

[1091-1100]
In this manner...

[1101-1110]
Liberate NOW.

[1111-1120]
This wanderer...

[1121-1125]
See your own face.
