Second tier: gods holding flower garlands. What do they hold? Not blossoms plucked from trees. These are the self-arisen ornaments of virtue accumulated. Each petal a moment of generosity, each thread a continuum of discipline. They wear their merit like crowns. But garlands fade. Even celestial flowers wither when the causes that created them exhaust. Look closely at what you hold—how long until it crumbles?

[998-1010]
These gods dwell in the second tier above the first, their garlands more refined, their virtue more accumulated. Yet they share the same fate: impermanence. An old practitioner once meditated on these garland-holding gods. He thought: if celestial merit-flowers fade, what of my own accumulation? Then he laughed. The recognition of fading is itself unfading.

[1011-1020]
Look. It is here. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[1021-1030]
Thus. We proceed. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[1031-1040]
Between the garland-gods and the recognition that transcends all gods, the path continues upward. Not rejecting the garlands. Not grasping them. The ornaments point beyond themselves. Rest in that recognition.

[1041-1050]
This old man once. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[1051-1060]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. Recognition is immediate.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[1061-1070]
Accordingly. The analysis. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognize immediately. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[1081-1090]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where do the faded garlands go?" The answer came in a vision: nowhere. They were never anywhere. The fading was the teaching. The withering was the blessing. The disappearance was the pointing. He bowed to the empty air where gods had stood.

[1091-1100]
In this manner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

This wanderer. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.
