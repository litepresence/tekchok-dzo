Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals examples. First: basis rigpa one, realization Buddha basis primordially self-liberated, conch like; non-realization sentient being confusion horn like. From Self-Arisen: son, example introduction thus, Buddha sentient being example conch horn manner, one from many arise.

[20212-20225]
This old practitioner once thought Buddha and sentient beings were fundamentally different. Like gold and stone, he thought. But his teacher laughed—Buddha and sentient beings are both the conch, just one recognizes, one doesn't. The conch doesn't become the horn; it is always the conch.

[20219-20235]
Voice 20 proclaims: Second, dimension one rigpa time self-place liberated, water drawing like basis primordially liberated. Non-awareness water fire like confusion condition source do. From that: rigpa non-awareness example water drawing manner, condition depend.

[20230-20250]
Three words. Stop. Recognize. Third, essence dimension one not transcended, rigpa water like power from mind water bubble and waves arise time, mind from rigpa not arise, power not become. From that: mind rigpa example water bubble manner, mind power not become.

[20245-20265]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Fourth, rigpa one, wisdom self-power not-mistaken grasp-holder liberated, gold like; intellect power mistaken grasp-holder arise, brass like. Similar basis rigpa only object perceive appear. From that: wisdom intellect example gold brass manner, color not divide.

[20255-20275]
This old hermit once mistook brass for gold. The color was similar, but the value vastly different. Mind and wisdom are like this—similar in appearance to the confused, worlds apart to the wise. Test them in the fire of practice; gold is purified, brass tarnishes.

[20270-20290]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Fifth, dimension one all-ground boat like, Dharmakaya ocean like state floating. Dharmakaya obscuration part or path or power manner arise. From that: all-ground Dharmakaya example ocean boat manner, path arise.

[20280-20305]
Between recognition and non-recognition, the vast middle way opens. The examples are not just poetic—they are precise pointers. The conch and horn share a shape but not essence. Water and bubble share substance but not stability. Gold and brass share color but not value.

[20300-20325]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis continues: Sixth, delusion liberation two basis rigpa state one, though one person sleep and wake like. From that: delusion liberation example sleep wake manner, faculty distinction exist.

[20320-20345]
This old practitioner once dreamed he was a butterfly, then woke and didn't know if he was a man who dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was a man. Delusion and liberation are like this—one state, two perceptions. The waking doesn't destroy the dream; it transcends it.

[20340-20360]
Voice 20 proclaims: Seventh, delusion appearance basis appearance two rigpa state appear equal, self-resonance day, reverse resonance night, clear unclear distinction. From that: delusion appearance bardo example darkness light manner, pure impure distinction.

[20350-20375]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis: Eighth, realize not-realize two rigpa one, delusion grasp grasp wake not wake distinction, yak hair touch nature condition not meet not realize like; sun condition meet time wake realize example. From Self-Arisen: realize not-realize example yak hair touch manner, appearance suppress not suppress distinction.

[20370-20395]
This old hermit offers final teaching on examples: The examples are bridges for those who cannot cross directly. Like a ferry across a river—once crossed, you don't carry the ferry. Don't cling to the examples; let them carry you to recognition, then let them go.

[20390-20415]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Don't mistake the finger for the moon! The examples point to recognition, but are not recognition itself. Like a map and the territory—don't try to live in the map. The examples are tools; use them, then set them aside.
