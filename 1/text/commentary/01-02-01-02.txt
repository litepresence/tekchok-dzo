[892-898] The iron rim of Meru—like the yak hair tent that keeps out wind but cannot keep out the cold of your own making. I spent three winters in a tent like that, thinking the walls were the problem. The yoke-holder, binding the continents in place—how many years did I bind myself with the idea that practice had to look a certain way? Frozen butter lamp on the altar, sputtering, going out. That was my meditation in those days. Lots of smoke, little light.

[899-910] Videha shaped like a crescent, Godaniya round, Kuru square. Each continent with its own logic, its own inhabitants. Jambudvipa in the south—ours, they say, the one with the fruit that grants realization. I used to wonder if I was born in the wrong place, if somewhere else practice would be easier. Then I noticed that doubt comes with me everywhere. Like a thief in an empty hut, searching for something to steal, finding nothing, stealing nothing, but still the door remains open.

[911-926] The eight hot hells below, the eight cold hells deeper still. Reviving, black thread, crushing, screaming, great screaming, heating, great heating, hell without interruption. Then the cold ones: blistering, great blistering, chattering, great chattering, aching, great aching, splitting like blue lotus, splitting like red lotus. I memorized these names once, thinking knowledge would protect me. Now I see hell every morning when I wake up angry about the cold floor. Every afternoon when irritation rises because the soup is too hot. The occasional hells—in fire, in water, in rock, in space—sudden, unpredictable. Like the moment of clarity that comes unbidden, or the confusion that swallows an entire afternoon of sitting.

[927-945] Pretas below the capital, throats thin as needles, bellies vast as mountains. I know this body. It wants what it cannot have, then has what it does not want. The scattered pretas among gods and humans—yes, you see them at the market, at the teaching, looking for something they cannot name. Animals in the ocean, animals on land—swimming in instinct, walking in habit. I have been a fish chasing a hook, a deer running toward the hunter's call. The demigods in the hollow below Meru's water, looking up at what they cannot reach. My own jealousy, sitting there like a guest who will not leave, drinking all the tea, complaining about the weather.

[946-968] The gods on Meru's tiers—thirty-three of them, with their cities and pleasure-groves. Sudharma, the assembly hall where they discuss dharma. Chariot Various-possessing, Rough-change, Enjoyment-mix, Everywhere-joy—the four parks. I have sat in meditation like a god in Sudharma, thinking I was having important insights. Then the session bell rings and I am back in the kitchen, chopping onions, wondering where the insight went. The wish-fulfilling tree that grants what is desired—how many of those have I planted in my mind? How many times have I sat expecting the tree to bear fruit immediately?

[969-985] The four great kings sending disease, weapons, famine. Dhritarashtra in the east with his lute, watching over the gandharvas. Virudhaka in the south with his sword, watching over the kumbhandas. Virupaksha in the west with his snake-banner, watching over the nagas. Vaishravana in the north with his victory-banner, watching over the yakshas. They send what is needed, not what is wanted. My body knows this—fever comes when I have pushed too hard, doubt comes when I have clung too tight. The seven mother-goddesses controlling individual action. I used to think they were watching me, judging. Now I see they are the seven ways I watch myself, the seven habits that make this life predictable, comfortable, stuck.

[986-996] The naga kings—Nanda, Upananda, Takshaka, Vasuki—guarding the four directions of Meru's base. When they are calm, the rains come properly. When they writhe, the earth shakes. My own energy at the base, coiled there, sometimes resting, sometimes restless. The text speaks of realms and beings, of distances measured in leagues and lifetimes measured in eons. But look at your own mind right now. Where is it located? How long has it been here? The continent you inhabit is not a shape on a map. It is the shape of your current thought. The realm you occupy is not below or above Meru. It is wherever your attention has settled. And like all realms, it shifts, it changes, it offers no lasting residence. Even the gods fall. Even the hells empty out. Only the looking remains, and the one who looks was never separate from what is seen.
