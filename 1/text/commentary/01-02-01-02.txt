When the nagas are pleased, the crops grow. When your consciousness is aligned, realization flourishes. When they are disturbed, drought comes. When your mind is agitated, practice withers. The four yakshas at the corners of Meru's peak—raising-time palaces. You read of them controlling the seasons, bringing summer rain, autumn grain, flower-ripening, winter cold, spring warmth. But look at your own subtle body. Are there not four energy centers at four corners of your heart? Do they not regulate the seasons of your practice—times of growth, harvest, ripening, dormancy, and renewal? Your meditation has its seasons. Do not expect spring flowers in winter. Do not expect harvest in spring. Know the time. The seven mother-goddesses who dwell in these regions, controlling individual action—these are the seven aspects of karma, the seven ways that your actions ripen. You are never free from their gaze. Every action you take, every thought you entertain—these goddesses record it, weave it into the fabric of your experience. But they are not external judges. They are your own awareness, naturally reflecting back to you the results of your conduct. And the four great kings, sending disease and weapons, famine and prosperity—do you think these are external deities controlling the world? They are the four cardinal principles of existence: impermanence, suffering, non-self, and peace. When you forget impermanence, they send disease to remind you. When you grasp at self, they send weapons to shatter your fortress. When you are attached to pleasure, they send famine to show you the emptiness of satisfaction. When you practice virtue, they make good—prosperity arises as the natural result of your actions. All of this is happening now, in your own experience. Do not look for it in some distant heaven. Look for it here.

Now we come to the lower realms—the hells, pretas, animals. You read of hot hells and cold hells, of yama-soothed tortures and bubble-possessing sufferings. Your intellect may recoil, or it may become fascinated with the descriptions. But listen closely, you who would be free.

Where are these hells? Twenty thousand leagues below Mount Meru, the text says. But look at your own mind when anger arises—where is that anger located? Is it not burning you right now? Is it not a hot hell, immediate and intense? When you are consumed by hatred, you are in Yama's realm. When you are frozen by jealousy, you are in the cold hells. The text describes these as lasting for eons, but have you not experienced moments that seemed like eons when you were in the grip of rage?

The hells are not punishments imposed by an external deity. They are the natural results of the mind's poisons. Anger produces the experience of burning. Attachment produces the experience of hunger—this is the preta realm, where beings have mouths the size of needles and stomachs like mountains, never satisfied. Delusion produces the experience of blind suffering—this is the animal realm, where beings act on instinct without understanding.

You read of occasional hells, without definite location, existing variously in earth, water, fire, wind. These are the sudden bursts of suffering that come upon you without warning—a sharp pain, a shocking loss, a moment of terror. They have no fixed abode because they arise from the unpredictability of your own karma.

The demigods, asuras, dwelling in the hollow space below Meru's water-level—you picture them gazing up at the gods' paradise, consumed with jealousy. But look at your own mind when you see another's success. Do you not dwell in that same hollow space, looking up at what others have, resenting your own position? The demigods' constant war with the gods is your own envy, your own competitiveness, your inability to rejoice in others' virtue.

The gods on Meru's tiers, with their cities and pleasure-groves—you may think this sounds pleasant. But listen: the gods are those moments when you experience temporary pleasure, success, or meditative bliss, and you think "this is it, this is liberation." You dwell in your pleasure-grove, intoxicated by your own accomplishments. But you are still on Mount Meru. You have not transcended the world-system. You have only risen to a higher tier. And from that height, the fall is further.

The text mentions the great yaksha kings—Golden-foot, Powerful, Entering-existence, Glory Splendor, Mountain-raising, Supreme-existence. These are the great successes of worldly life, the achievements that make you feel powerful and glorious. But they are still yakshas—nature spirits, powerful but bound. They send disease and famine when their domains are threatened. Your worldly success, when clung to, becomes the cause of your suffering.

Do not seek to be born among the gods. Do not fear the hells. Recognize that all realms are mind. When anger arises, recognize its nature, and the hot hell is instantly cool. When craving arises, see its emptiness, and the preta finds food. When delusion arises, know it as wisdom, and the animal awakens. The transformation does not happen in some future life. It happens now, in the recognition of what is.

The demigods' realm described in detail now—golden cities, pleasure-groves, wish-fulfilling trees, great elephants, swift horses. You read this and think of mythology, of ancient cosmology. But look at the envy in your own heart. The asura city of Gold-possessing, with its assembly-place Good-wealth and its parks of joy—this is the realm of those who have much but cannot enjoy it because they are obsessed with what others have. The tree Chief Tsi Tri Pa, the elephant Difficult-to-endure, the horse Swift—these are the talents and resources you possess, which become sources of competition rather than joy because you compare yourself to others. You may have wealth, but you see someone wealthier and you are miserable. You may have skill, but you see someone more skilled and you are tormented. This is the asura condition. Not lacking, but unable to enjoy because of jealousy. The demigods have pleasure-groves equal to the gods', but they cannot enter them. They are blocked by the roots of their own resentment. Then we ascend to the desire gods' realms—the six types. Great King Four, Thirty-three, Conflict-free, Joy-possess, Emanation-joy, Other-emanation-power. Each higher than the last, each with greater pleasure and longer life. You read of their palaces, their gardens, their nectar, their music, and you think "this sounds wonderful." But listen, you who seek true happiness. These gods are meditators who have achieved temporary concentration, practitioners who have accumulated merit, beings who have created good karma. Their pleasures are the results of virtuous action. But they are still in the desire realm. They still experience desire, albeit refined. They are still within the world-system. When their merit is exhausted, they fall. The text describes the Thirty-three gods on the peak of Meru, with Indra's palace Completely-victorious, surrounded by four pleasure-groves: Chariot Various-possessing, Rough-change, Enjoyment-mix, Everywhere-joy. These are the four immeasurables—loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity—practiced by those who have achieved the level of the Thirty-three. But practiced with attachment to the experience. Practiced with the thought "I am practicing." This is why they remain in the desire realm. The tree Complete Gather Burst, the white rock slab, the assembly-place Dharma Good—these are the supports of their meditation. But they are external supports. They depend on conditions. When the condition changes, the support fails. True meditation has no support. It does not depend on a tree or a rock or an assembly. It is the nature of mind itself, always present, always free. You read of the sun and moon palaces, fifty-one leagues, fifty leagues, made of fire-crystal and water-crystal, surrounded by towers and fences, adorned by gods' cities. Beautiful imagery. But the sun and moon are the right and left channels in your body, the solar and lunar energies. Their palaces are the chakras at the crown. Their circling is the natural movement of prana. Their light is the light of wisdom and method united.
