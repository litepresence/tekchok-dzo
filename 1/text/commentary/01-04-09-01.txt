[3017-3021] The first position says that all these various appearances we see right now—objects, consciousnesses, the whole dualistic show—both the appearance and the mind that perceives it, they're all just stains on awareness. Take a window that's gotten dirty over years. The dirt isn't the window, but it's not separate from it either. Ultimate reality is the wisdom of non-duality, the element with all its qualities. But that doesn't mean consciousness is ultimately real—it's not established at all. The Buddha's dharmakāya leaves nothing behind.

[3021-3027] The stainless suchness, that's the non-dual wisdom. When there are still latent tendencies, even a Buddha sees apparent confusion—illness, taste experiences. But those are just residual stains. Right now, our mind has afflictions and wisdom all mixed together like dirty water. Remove the false part—the afflictions—and pure wisdom without remainder manifests. That's what they claim.

[3028-3034] The pure position says that aspects and consciousness aren't even established as merely false. Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated to the mind's small work. Eventually, without even thinking, the appearance of its aspects disappears and clear luminosity dawns, like the sun coming out from behind clouds. Therefore, the various white and red aspects of objects appear, and the perceiving mind appears too, but both are absent—like reflections in a mirror. Only self-cognizing wisdom that experiences that meaning ultimately exists, they claim.

[3035-3036] The second position is the Svātantrika and Prasaṅgika Madhyamikas.
