Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to understand the "pure position" by cleaning his tent until it was spotless. He thought purity meant no stains. This old practitioner watched him work for three days, then asked: "Where do you put the dirt?" The hermit looked at his pile of filth and laughed. All these various appearances we see right now—objects, consciousnesses, the whole dualistic show—both the appearance and the mind that perceives it, they're all just stains on awareness. Take a window that's gotten dirty over years. The dirt isn't the window, but it's not separate from it either. You can clean the window. But the window was always clear. The dirt was never its nature.

The stainless suchness, that's the non-dual wisdom. When there are still latent tendencies, even a Buddha sees apparent confusion—illness, taste experiences. But those are just residual stains, like the smell of smoke in a tent after the fire's gone out. Right now, our mind has afflictions and wisdom all mixed together like dirty water in a mountain stream. Remove the false part—the afflictions—and pure wisdom without remainder manifests. That's what they claim. This yogi once spent a year trying to remove his afflictions like a cook straining soup. Finally his teacher said: "Stop straining. Let the sediment settle. The water clarifies itself." He stopped straining. The water clarified. Not because he did something. Because he stopped doing.

The pure position says that aspects and consciousness aren't even established as merely false. Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated to the mind's small work. Eventually, without even thinking, the appearance of its aspects disappears and clear luminosity dawns, like the sun coming out from behind clouds. Therefore, the various white and red aspects of objects appear, and the perceiving mind appears too, but both are absent—like reflections in a mirror. Only self-cognizing wisdom that experiences that meaning ultimately exists, they claim. This old practitioner keeps a mirror in his tent. Every morning he looks. Every morning he forgets: the reflection is not the mirror, but where else could it be? The mirror doesn't cling to reflections. It doesn't reject them. It just reflects. This is the model.

Second position: Svatantrika and Prasangika Madhyamikas. Different approaches, same mountain. Don't get attached to the path. Walk it. This hermit spent years in debate between these schools. Svatantrika uses logic, builds arguments. Prasangika demolishes positions, shows contradictions. Both lead to emptiness. Both are fingers pointing. But the Prasangika finger is sharper, quicker. It cuts through grasping at logic itself. Not that logic is bad—just don't grasp. Both schools practice the four truths and the twelve links. They meditate on impurity, on skeletons, on the eight unpleasant objects. They cultivate compassion. They are serious practitioners, not mere philosophers.
