Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to understand the "pure position" by cleaning his tent until it was spotless. He thought purity meant no stains. This old practitioner watched him work for three days, then asked: "Where do you put the dirt?" The hermit looked at his pile of filth and laughed. All these various appearances we see right now—objects, consciousnesses, the whole dualistic show—both the appearance and the mind that perceives it, they're all just stains on awareness. Take a window that's gotten dirty over years. The dirt isn't the window, but it's not separate from it either. You can clean the window. But the window was always clear. The dirt was never its nature.

The stainless suchness, that's the non-dual wisdom. When there are still latent tendencies, even a Buddha sees apparent confusion—illness, taste experiences. But those are just residual stains, like the smell of smoke in a tent after the fire's gone out. Right now, our mind has afflictions and wisdom all mixed together like dirty water in a mountain stream. Remove the false part—the afflictions—and pure wisdom without remainder manifests. That's what they claim. This yogi once spent a year trying to remove his afflictions like a cook straining soup. Finally his teacher said: "Stop straining. Let the sediment settle. The water clarifies itself." He stopped straining. The water clarified. Not because he did something. Because he stopped doing.

The pure position says that aspects and consciousness aren't even established as merely false. Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated to the mind's small work. Eventually, without even thinking, the appearance of its aspects disappears and clear luminosity dawns, like the sun coming out from behind clouds. Therefore, the various white and red aspects of objects appear, and the perceiving mind appears too, but both are absent—like reflections in a mirror. Only self-cognizing wisdom that experiences that meaning ultimately exists, they claim. This old practitioner keeps a mirror in his tent. Every morning he looks. Every morning he forgets: the reflection is not the mirror, but where else could it be? The mirror doesn't cling to reflections. It doesn't reject them. It just reflects. This is the model.

[3035-3036]
The second position is the Svatantrika and Prasangika Madhyamikas. Different approaches, same mountain. Don't get attached to the path. Walk it. This hermit spent years in debate between these schools. Svatantrika uses logic, builds arguments. Prasangika demolishes positions, shows contradictions. Both lead to emptiness. Both are fingers pointing. But the Prasangika finger is sharper, quicker. It cuts through grasping at logic itself. Not that logic is bad—just don't grasp. Both schools practice the four truths and the twelve links. They meditate on impurity, on skeletons, on the eight unpleasant objects. They cultivate compassion. They are serious practitioners, not mere philosophers.

[3017-3027]
Impure and pure—these are stages, not fixed categories. Like washing a cloth: first heavily stained, then less stained, then clean, then never stained. The Mind-Only school describes these stages carefully. But this old practitioner warns: don't think you move linearly from impure to pure. Sometimes you go back. Sometimes you leap. Sometimes you realize you were never impure. The stages are descriptive, not prescriptive. Don't cling to the map. Walk the territory. The impure position is where we start. Confused, afflicted, grasping. The pure position is where we end. Clear, luminous, free. But the ending is not different from the beginning. It's the same nature, recognized.

[3028-3034]
The pure position is the goal: aspects and consciousness not even established as false. What does this mean? It means even the designation "false" is too much. It's not that appearances are false reflections in a mirror. It's that the mirror itself is empty of inherent existence. The reflection is empty. The knowing of reflection is empty. Yet—luminosity dawns. Clear light manifests. This is beyond words. This old practitioner has tasted this once, in a winter retreat. Can't describe it. Can only point toward it. The knower and known collapse into knowing. The cognizer and cognized dissolve into cognition. This is what the Cittamatras point toward.

[3022-3027]
The Buddha's Dharmakaya, stainless suchness—this is what remains when stains are removed. But "removal" is tricky. You're not taking something away from something else. You're recognizing that what appeared as stain was never separate from suchness. Like recognizing that waves are not other than water. The wave doesn't become water. It always was water. The affliction doesn't become wisdom. It always was wisdom's display. This is the highest view. Not purification as removal. Purification as recognition. Not transformation as change. Transformation as seeing what was always true. This is the Mind-Only completion. But the Middle Way goes further. Even this is empty.

[3017-3021]
This hermit returns to the analogy of the window and dirt. The dirt is confusion. The window is awareness. You can clean the window—this is the path of purification. Or you can recognize the dirt was never other than the window's nature—this is the direct path. Both work. Both lead to the same place. Some need to clean. Some can leap directly. No shame in either approach. The destination is the same. The window doesn't care if it's dirty or clean. It holds both equally. This is the nature of mind. It holds all experience equally. The pure and the impure. The confused and the clear. All are its display.

[3028-3034]
Clear luminosity dawns. This is the experience of the pure position. Not blindness, not voidness. Clarity without object. Luminosity without perceiver. Wisdom without wisdom-possessor. This old practitioner has heard this described a thousand ways. Every description falls short. So he stops describing. Sits in his tent. Watches the light change. This is the practice. This is the attainment. This is the beyond-attainment. The Cittamatras call it self-cognizing wisdom. The Madhyamikas will call it emptiness. The Dzogchenpas will call it rigpa. Different names. Same recognition. Don't get stuck on names.

[3035-3036]
Svatantrika and Prasangika—the progression from Mind-Only to Middle Way. First you see mind is primary. Then you see mind is empty. First you see appearance is mind. Then you see mind is appearance. The progression matters. You can't start with emptiness. Well, you can, but you'll misunderstand it. Build the foundation. Then demolish it. The demolition is the point. This is the Buddhist path. Not one-shot enlightenment. Gradual cultivation leading to sudden recognition. Or sudden recognition followed by gradual cultivation. Both happen. Both are valid. Don't be rigid about the path. The path is whatever leads you to the goal.

[3022-3027]
Stainless suchness—this phrase haunts this hermit. What is stainless? The cloth that was never stained? Or the cloth cleaned so thoroughly no stain remains? The Mind-Only school says both. The Buddha's Dharmakaya was never stained. Our own mind, obscured by temporary confusion, can be cleaned. But ultimately, the cleaning reveals what was always there. Not a new acquisition. A recognition. This is crucial! You're not becoming something you weren't. You're recognizing what you always were. The stainless suchness. The non-dual wisdom. The clear light. Call it what you will. It's not different from your mind right now. Just seen clearly.

[3017-3034]
This practitioner returns to the beginning. Impure and pure aspects. Stained and stainless. These are ways of talking about the path. The impure is where we start—confused, afflicted, suffering. The pure is where we end—clear, wise, free. But the path is not a journey from here to there. It's a recognition that here is there. That confusion is wisdom's display. That the stain is the suchness. This is hard to accept. It sounds like nonsense. But investigate. Look at your own mind. Is confusion separate from awareness? Or is it awareness confused? The confusion is temporary. The awareness is not. This is the Mind-Only insight.

Emaho! Pure, impure, stained, stainless—just words describing the same awareness from different angles. The window doesn't care if it's dirty or clean. It holds both equally. The mirror doesn't cling to reflections or reject them. It just reflects. This is the model for mind. This is the practice. This is the fruition. Don't try to purify what was never impure. Don't try to clean what was never dirty. Just recognize. Just see. Just be. This is the Mind-Only completion. Now go beyond. To the Middle Way. To the emptiness of even this. To the great perfection that includes all and transcends all. Emaho!
