[12522-12530]
External conditions are merely helpers—the true practice is internal. This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[12522-12535]
Grasping without support, sky-like nature, self-liberated vastness. Without support, ye-re! Spontaneous, zangthal! Without truth, bun-ne! Beyond root, khre-se! In great dharmata's equal nature, smile with joy, gle-ge! Resting thus, inner grasping mind's stake is extracted—this has purpose! When object-mind are recognized baseless rootless

[12531-12555]
Whether you practice for three years or seven, whether the signs arise quickly or slowly, do not be attached to progress. The path itself is the result. Every moment of recognition is complete in itself.

[12536-12560]
: secret self-awareness free from grasping-fixation elaboration goes. Rigpa self-clear ka-dag great, guru's instruction introduces, four lamps cause space-awareness non-separation, clear light nature meditating.

Outer space's appearing self-radiance's five lights clear

[12556-12580]
When obstacles arise, recognize them as displays. When good experiences arise, recognize them as displays.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. When nothing arises, recognize that as the display of emptiness.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. In all cases, the recognition is what matters.

[12561-12580]
—like mirror's reflections, appearing externally but essence internally dwelling. Appearance-emptiness like moon in water—know thus! Do not attachment-grasp to appearances.

Looking at outer appearance's clear light

[12581-12605]
The great masters of the past achieved liberation through this practice. You have the same nature as them, the same potential. What they achieved, you can achieve. Have confidence in this!

[12581-12600]
: inner rigpa's clear light is clear back. Rigpa free from meditation-concept's antidote, vast view of natural clarity; resting in natural presence's clear meditation; clear light conduct without accepting-rejecting; ka-dag self-clear result found.

Without abandoning confused appearance, it is abandoned; without blocking confused thought, it ceases; without training duality, it is purified; faults without abandoning are pure from ka; qualities without seeking are spontaneously accomplished.

Emaho!

[12601-12620]
: view beyond view's object, meditation beyond meditation's mind, conduct beyond conduct's calculation, result beyond result's phenomena. Samsara expelling's fortune, dharmata manifest appearance's pure land wide, joy's source good country, nine desires' self-arising palace found.

Original protector King Unchanging Light

[12606-12630]
Yet do not think 'I will become a great siddha!' This too is delusion. Simply practice with sincerity, and let the result take care of itself. The fruit of the practice is not for you—it is for the benefit of all beings.

[12621-12640]
and five lights' spontaneous presence queen gathered, supreme boy light inconceivable meeting his own parents—this is called the time of joy-bliss inseparable's eternal fortune. Rest in this understanding.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

These extensively taught before

[12631-12655]
When you achieve stability in this practice, you can help others. Your mere presence becomes a blessing. Your words become dharma. Your actions become benefit for beings. This is the true result.

Emaho!

[12641-12660]
; now specifically: Sun and Moon Union states, "Listen Sugata! These are all included, obtaining one abiding thigle." What is that? Placing various, self-arrived; intentions show timing; exhaustion shows intention; stable confidence non-reversing signs.

Thus matters are included

[12656-12680]
You who have read this far, you have great merit. These teachings are the secret essence of the great perfection, precious beyond measure. Cherish them!

[12661-12680]
: space's lamp who sees directly practices dharmadhatu; thigle's lamp who sees obtains support of all with effort; wisdom's lamp who sees realizes general and specific characteristics; water's lamp who sees obtains power over faculties. Recognition is immediate.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Who matures vajra chain

[12681-12705]
In degenerate times, when beings are caught in distraction and delusion, this practice of thod rgal is like a lightning path. Swift, direct, and powerful—it can carry you to awakening in one lifetime.

[12681-12700]
: rigpa arrives at the capital. The result: these three kayas are self-awareness's ground. Nature-abiding bardo who matures these, all elements self-exhaust, changing without doubt.

Emaho!

[12701-12720]
—clearing unclear like a beautiful woman mirror-looking—eight aspects: certain death causes with examples, death signs investigation, reversal methods, death-point appearances, crucial pointing-out instructions, birth-place signs, purification rituals, uncommon other places. The nature is complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

First

[12706-12730]
Do not delay your practice. Life is short and uncertain. The time to practice is now, while you have the favorable conditions of a human body and the precious teachings.

[12721-12750]
: difficult to obtain Jambudvipa as Dharma-practicing place, obtained; difficult to obtain leisure and endowments, obtained; difficult to meet guru good spiritual friend, met; difficult to enter sublime Dharma precious door, entered; difficult to know unsurpassed instructions unfabricated, known; difficult to abandon samsara suffering's ocean, abandoned to go to liberation enlightenment's island—if not practiced now with effort and courage, outer such favorable conditions will not occur again. Rest in this understanding.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Nagarjuna's statement

[12731-12755]
Every moment of recognition is a moment of liberation. Rest in this understanding.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Every moment of delusion is a moment of samsara.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Choose recognition! Rest in your true nature!

[12751-12770]
: "Dwelling in favorable place, relying on holy beings, oneself well-prayed, previous virtues arise—you possess the four great wheels." Shantideva: "This leisure is extremely difficult to obtain; for one who has accomplished purpose, if not diligent now, when will favorable conditions arise again?"

From the Treasury

[12756-12778]
The displays of light are beautiful, the pure lands are magnificent, but do not be seduced by them. They are merely the path, not the destination.

[12771-12778]
: having obtained such leisure, if not diligent now, the dead go to lower realms; for kalpas numbering billions, even happy realms' sound is not heard—what need to speak of obtaining happiness? The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.
