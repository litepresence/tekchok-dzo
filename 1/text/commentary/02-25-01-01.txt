[15635-15640]
Listen! From Pearl Garland: "Liberation place itself is primordial." Thus. In primordial primordial purity, awareness knowing own face, not returning to cause, confusion ground exhausted, name changes to 'result.' From previously explained ground context in detail, should be known as distinguished by being free from stains.

[15641-15661]
Second has three: Actual mode of liberation in expanse. Nature of abiding in expanse. How suchness intent expanse coils in expanse. First: When sharp, dull, medium faculties liberate, no difference in result. All three times' Buddhas, Dharmakaya beyond expression, intention exhausted, one in that, face-equal without difference nature, sole bindu Buddha. Whether in this life with remainder, or in bardo self-appearance held, or exhaling breath in emanation field. Path-appearance body and pristine awareness appearance external clear aspects, spontaneously dissolving into expanse, like light gathering inside crystal, appearance liberated into emptiness, pristine awareness dissolving into expanse, form body passing beyond sorrow in Dharmakaya expanse, thing and mark non-existent sky-like suchness, one taste like space dissolving into space.

Example: Awareness cut separate from expanse, abiding in body like space inside vase, related to great space through vase's opening. Four Lamps connect with primordial primordially pure. When vase breaks, external-internal-intermediate three spaces non-dual, one essence abiding. Body-mind separated, five awarenesses without external-internal gap, great internal expanse primordially pure great abiding.

From Six Expanses: "In Samantabhadra state, all elaborations completely pacified, unrivaled Buddha, all dharmas' eye dust free." Seeing fields everywhere limitless, external-internal appearance non-dual mixed, obtaining completely pure expanse intent.

Emaho! This is the great liberation! The five awarenesses become the five wisdoms. The body becomes the mandala. Space inside and outside the vase is never different—only the walls made it seem separate. Your nature and the nature of all Buddhas is the same space!

[15662-15677]
Listen! At that time, samsara itself is called "cut from beginning and end." Thus. Like space mixed, or external appearance self-light rays dissolving into expanse, sun setting, rays gathering into themselves. Like water dissolving into water, butter into butter. From Blazing Body Relic: "Then in essence primordially pure, like sun's rays gathering, self-appearance including emanation, own essence self-dissolved, without division, without dividing becomes. Like water dissolving into water, thus butter into butter, space dissolving into space, non-dual, without certain grasping becomes." Thus.

[15678-15699]
At that time, dissolving into primordially pure internal expanse, awareness holds own place, becoming Victor Unchanging Light Buddha, perfect authority teacher Samantabhadra Pristine Awareness Spontaneously Accomplished Protector Vajra Holder. Path dharmas exhausted by obtaining result. Result dharmas, like full moon's increase and decrease, completely perfected, no going beyond that, reaching exhaustion place.

From Self-Arising: "Realized person with intelligence, dissolving into unchanging equality state. Conception-free wisdom self-dawns. In that great piled bliss ground, like unarranged jewel heap, variously arising and naturally dissolving. All Buddhas' ancestor, unchanging light, universally renowned." Thus.

From Six Expanses: "Memory-knowings, when passing beyond sorrow, expression's extremes all self-self-dissolved. Aggregates, ayatanas, elements passing beyond sorrow, all apparent existence appears as bliss field. Faculties and objects passing beyond sorrow, supreme mudra's great enjoyment self-appears. Sounds and words, at passing beyond sorrow time, transcending all appearance. View-meditation-action result, at passing beyond sorrow time, effortful memory self-dissolved. Dharmas and wisdom passing beyond sorrow, divine bodies unobservable, covered by seal."

This is the completion! Everything dissolves into its true nature—not destroyed, but recognized. Samsara was never other than nirvana. The apparent world becomes the pure field. This is not future—it's the nature right now!

[15700-15710]
Listen! When experience passes beyond sorrow, byung tshor's door also self-self-ceases. Heat and signs self-dissolved, when passing beyond sorrow, afflictions self-dissolved, emptied. Person practicing this exhaustion dharma, developed and self-completed. Whoever sees this essence-abiding capable person, this is Samantabhadra's essence—own nature of all Buddhas' result. Whoever becomes familiar with all Buddhas' result, becomes glorious Vajra holder. First protector, stainless pure, from light womb self-arisen, all Buddhas' activity nature, obtains great secret supreme body. From that non-reversing, yogi with intelligence and power, capable, reaching all result's extent, equal to Samantabhadra. Thus.

[15711-15735]
Such primordially pure own face, free from existence-nonexistence extremes, body and pristine awareness appearance transcending existence-nonexistence. Ground-appearance merely non-ceased—like crystal own face, light and color nowhere established. From that state, five lights' ground-appearance non-ceased.

From Thal 'gyur: "Though result cannot be expressed, dharmas reaching exhaustion place, own establishment's extreme also destroyed. At this time, lama's pith instruction hidden. View-meditation-action's extremes empty, dharma appearance non-existent. Body and pristine awareness continuity cut. No Buddha, no sentient being. Briefly, nothing abiding. Without going, no coming." Thus.

From Six Expanses: "Thus in suchness primordially pure, no pristine awareness, no body either. Without light, free from colors. Essence nowhere established, ignorance and afflictions—what need to mention? Non-existent." Thus.

Thus internal expanse primordially pure nature, only ground-appearance...

Emaho! This is the radical Dzogchen view! At the ultimate level, even Buddha and sentient beings are not established. Not nihilism—it's the freedom from all concepts, all grasping. The path exhausts itself, like a fire exhausting its fuel. What's left? The natural state, beyond description!

[15736-15748]
Listen! Actually nowhere established as anything. From that itself: "In nature's appearance, no mark-grasping at all. Not color, self-clear, knowing and awareness aspects only. Without grasping's held object, no conception's grasping aspect. In light-transcending self-radiance, primordially abiding distinguished. In body-transcending self-radiance, completely pure great mudra abiding." Thus.

Emaho! One should not grasp at experiences. The clear light, the bliss, the visions—these are all marks if grasped. The true nature is beyond light and dark, beyond form and formless. As space requires no light to be space, so the nature requires no experiences to be complete.

[15749-15773]
Second, nature of awareness abiding in expanse has five: Elements Mama Zhayog. Dissolving into pristine awareness expanse. Wisdom elevating to sky. Coiling in luminous clarity expanse. Awareness holding own place. First: Three wombs gathered as one, five elements liberated below, unobstructed to pure pristine awareness eye. That too, when impure confusion appearance dissolves into pure suchness, flesh-blood body dissolves into luminous illusory body, then that itself dissolves into Dharmakaya jewel secret body. Wisdom eye dissolves into pristine awareness eye, that itself dissolves into suchness eye, object and knower activity completely pure. In jewel secret womb, internally clear pristine awareness intent, without transfer or change.

From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Impure confusion appearance obscures pristine awareness appearance. Confusion appearance ceases, pure appearance dawns. Latency womb obscures pristine awareness illusory body. Abandoning this body, light appearance dawns. Then reaches jewel womb's end. Three wombs gathered as one, emanation in ten directions accomplished." Thus.

Present body's five elements' dregs purified. If calculated as separately abiding in primordially pure internal expanse luminous clarity five great elements' expanse, impure elements actually become pure elements or abiding as Mama Zhayog, not so.

Thus is the completion of the path. The body dissolves, not into nothingness, but into light. The elements transform into wisdom. One should not fear this dissolution—it is the natural completion, as ice becomes water, water becomes vapor, vapor becomes space.

[15774-15775]
Listen! Impure five elements purified by power, with reference to appearing capable five pristine awarenesses' pure five great elements, pure result aspects are posited.

[15776-15805]
That too, wind vajra cross arrangement well-made, samaya goddess coiling in sky, unmoving wind dissolving into expanse. Earth five jewels' stupa well-arranged and well-fashioned, dissolving into solid-free earth expanse. Water crystal wheel well-stacked, liberated from karma and affliction aspect, dissolving into moisture-free water expanse. Fire lotus net blazing, ripening unripened, dissolving into heat-free fire expanse. Space completely pure suchness, vast expanse, primordially pure, impure confusion opening, dissolving into space expanse. External objects, internal body, aggregates, elements, ayatanas, etc., all dharmas completely pure. Pristine awareness jewel essence, empty all-arising mandala vast expanse.

From Self-Arising: "Five jewels' plain is all even. Jewel secret sun, no rising-setting. Jewel water lotus, no stain. Jewel fire mandala, well-constructed. Jewel wind wisdom, no conception. Jewel earth mandala, great vehicle. Jewel space, without limit or center. Jewel empty mandala, well-drawn. Jewel body relic blazing stupa, well-stacked."

From Direct Introduction: "Eye and eye consciousness, ear and ear consciousness, nose and appearance consciousness, tongue and tongue consciousness, body and body consciousness knowing suchness, body completely passed beyond sorrow, form aggregate completely pure. Space completely passed beyond sorrow, conception aggregate completely pure."

Emaho! Thus is the completion of purification. The elements, the senses, the aggregates—all recognized as the display of wisdom. The stupa is not a building—it is the body recognized as the mandala. The jewels are not ornaments—they are the wisdom qualities naturally present.

[15806-15811]
Listen! Earth completely passed beyond sorrow, feeling aggregate completely pure. Fire completely passed beyond sorrow, consciousness aggregate completely pure. Wind completely passed beyond sorrow, formation aggregate completely pure. Thus.

[15812-15828]
Second, dissolving into pristine awareness expanse: Five afflictions purified as five pristine awarenesses' five self-radiances dissolving into internal expanse luminous clarity, abiding as ground-appearance of five clear depth colors. From Six Expanses: "Self-radiance moved, white aspect, abiding as great clear depth itself. Appearance self-dissolved, yellow aspect, unmanifest from depth, own face clear. Attachment-aversion self-dissolved, red aspect, clear depth unmixed, abiding greatly. Effort accomplishment movement self-freed, inexhaustible green, also first rays, unmanifest from depth, clear aspect. Unchanging perfection dark blue, primordially perfect, without making, abides." Thus.

Emaho! Thus is the completion of the alchemical process. The five afflictions—ignorance, attachment, aversion, pride, jealousy—transform into the five wisdoms. Not destroyed, not rejected—transformed through recognition. As base metal becomes gold through alchemical process, so confusion becomes wisdom when one recognizes its true nature.

[15829-15841]
Third, wisdom elevating to sky: Internal expanse five pristine awareness winds abiding unmoving, without transfer or change in own place. These too: Powerful Lady, Holding Dynamic Lady, Elevating Lady, Stable Lady, Appearing Making Lady. From these five: Water-pure nature, downward-clearing Powerful Lady, joins main-circle non-dual with pristine awareness wind, actually without division. Wind-pure nature, upward-moving Holding Dynamic, moves five main-circles in Dharmakaya state in an instant. Earth-pure nature, pervading ground-appearance aspect abiding Elevating Lady, without support-supported, abides as form body in Dharmakaya state. Appearing Making Lady, space-pure nature, non-existent equal four appearances' Dharmakaya and pristine awareness actually non-existent, abiding as internally clear in clear depth ground-appearance aspect. Stable Lady, earth-pure nature, life wind ground-appearance aspect, makes awareness pristine awareness non-conceiving intent unmoving from...

Thus is the subtle body completion. The five winds, the five elements—all purified into the five wisdoms. The body becomes the mandala, the channels become wisdom's path. One should not make it complicated—it is the recognition that the physical body is the display of wisdom.

[15842-15849]
Listen! From that itself: "Primordially self-pure great perfection, abiding at peak of perfections. Possessing marks self-pure, abiding as ground of great clear depth." Thus. From Self-Arising: "Jewel variously arranged net is even." Thus.

[15850-15869]
Fourth, coiling in luminous clarity expanse has four: Dissolving without obscuration. Clear without conception. Existing without self. Non-mixed individually, not divided. First, dissolving without obscuration: Elements Mama Zhayog, dissolving into pristine awareness expanse, yet three kayas without gathering-separation, abiding as internally clear subtle pristine awareness. Second: Dharmakaya stainless, without front-back, without above-below, without directions-intermediate points, luminous, abiding as body and pristine awareness ground-appearance, without mind and breath, unsullied by all samsara dharmas.

Third: Existing, view's self-arisen king, free from latency-self. Fourth: In Dharmakaya expanse, five blazing jewel light bodies abiding as clear depth, first ground abiding in own place, yet without conception of that ground, now not divided as samsara confusion. That too, from wisdom ripening as body, moving five bodies in expanse.

[15870-15882]
Fifth, awareness holding own place has four: Dharmakaya unchanging, vajra-like body. Pristine awareness unchanging, swastika-like life. Intent without gathering-separation, river-like continuity. Awareness without clear-obscure, sun-like rays. First: Awareness form body dissolving into Dharmakaya, becoming one essence, without transfer-change. Second: Essence-holding pristine awareness, nature characteristic-holding pristine awareness, compassion world-taming pristine awarenesses, as mere ground-appearance aspect, abiding without division from own face, so called "all-time pristine awareness." Third...

One should not be intimidated by the technical terms. This describes the stability of recognition. Once recognized, it is not lost—it is not something that comes and goes. As one knows one's own name—one does not forget it and remember it. The 'coiling' is complete integration.

[15883-15892]
Listen! Without gathering or separation in continuous samadhi, without transfer or change from suchness beyond thought samadhi. Fourth: Self-arising awareness abiding as great internally clear spontaneous accomplishment, abiding without transfer or change in jewel womb. These too, from Self-Arising: "Jewel vajra seat, no change. Jewel empty path, no end. Intent self-abiding, shown as pith instruction." Thus.

[15893-15926]
Third: How suchness intent expanse coils in expanse, in three parts: Briefly shown essence. Extensively explained aspects. Summarized meaning. First: In primordially pure expanse, spontaneously accomplished clear depth awareness pristine awareness luminous heart essence, being root of all Buddha dharmas, called "great scripture." Immeasurable, so vast. Buddhas, so powerful. View's ultimate deliverance place. Unchanging nail. Beyond this-side seeing intellect's examined object, bow. All-knowing mirror. All paths' traversed peak. Liberation object. Secret king's all dharmas' great treasury house.

From No Letter: "Awareness pristine awareness unmistakenly shown. Unchanging root great scripture. Vast dharma great appearance. Intent suchness great power. View self-arisen great deliverance place. Unchanging great nail letter. Always difficult great bow. Difficult to see great mirror. Difficult to traverse great path. Difficult to abide great object. Difficult to reach great ground. Appearance without existing, great appearance. Bottomless, difficult to measure great. Non-pervading self-radiance great. Great knowing without analyzer. Object-knowing non-dual great intent. Mindless great appearance."

Emaho! These 'greats' are not exaggerations—they point to the utter transcendence of the nature. Beyond all measure, beyond all limits, yet right here. One should not make it distant—it is the immediacy of one's own awareness.

[15927-15942]
Listen to these "great perfections"! Unchanging completely expansive great perfection. Subtle, difficult to grasp, great perfection. Vast, without seeing, great perfection. Round, without shape, great perfection. Shaking, without breath, great perfection. Clear, black color, great perfection. Non-existent, soft, great perfection. Appearing, difficult to examine, great perfection. Empty, appearing, great perfection. One, without break, great perfection. Appearing like two, completely perfect great perfection. Beautiful, without ornament, great perfection. Full, empty, great perfection. Ripened, not completed, great perfection. Body-like appearance, without coming-going, great perfection.

Emaho! Longchenpa explodes all concepts. Each pair of opposites—both are 'great perfection.' Not one or the other—both, neither, beyond. This is not philosophy—it is a direct pointing to the nature that cannot be pinned down by any concept.

[15943-15961]
That too, expanse and pristine awareness appearing as two, in Dharmakaya's state, appearing as ground-appearance to clear depth body. Second, extensive explanation of aspects has two: Essence, measured as empty—primordially pure, sky-like, nowhere established, free from extremes, great perfection, Dharmakaya's vast expanse. Aspects, measured as clear—in Dharmakaya expanse' depths, internally clear spontaneously accomplished pristine awareness, inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel's source, abiding as clear depth in subtle aspect.

From that side, divided: Pristine awareness mandala of five pristine awarenesses, primordially clear. Nothing above that pristine awareness, so high depth. Pristine awareness palace spontaneously accomplished, so vast, etc. From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Jewel-arranged mandala, unwritten, clear. Pristine awareness stable mountain king, unconstructed, high depth. Pristine awareness expansive palace, unmade, vast. Pristine awareness vast expanse ocean, unmuddied, self-radiance. Pristine awareness clear sun, unmade, without rising-setting. Emptiness expansive plain, unarranged, even. Pristine awareness unchanging path, untrained, without near-far. Awareness unchanging horse, running, without cessation. Awareness objectless river, without interruption."

One should not take these literally. The 'palace,' 'mountain,' 'ocean' are metaphors for aspects of awareness. Unmade, untrained, unwritten—the nature is not a construction. It is naturally perfect, naturally clear, naturally expansive.

[15962-15968]
Listen to these seven aspects of awareness-pristine awareness! Awareness pristine awareness seed—no increase or decrease. Awareness empty-clear pristine awareness—not divisible. Awareness non-grasping pristine awareness—free from identification extremes. Awareness conception-free pristine awareness—completely clear in non-cessation. Awareness all-clear pristine awareness—unmixed, completely perfect. Awareness all-appearing pristine wisdom—clear without grasping. Awareness all-clear pristine awareness—clear and spontaneously dense. Thus.

From Self-Arising: "Jewel measureless palace well-arranged. Jewel variously spread queen, good ornaments. Jewel beautiful horse, swift as wind. Jewel various plains inexhaustible." Thus.

Emaho! These are not descriptions of some celestial realm—they describe one's own awareness. The 'palace' is the expanse of rigpa. The 'jewels' are its qualities. Everything is complete, nothing needs to be added. As a king in his palace—one is already enthroned in the kingdom of awareness.

[15968-15988]
Third, summarizing meaning-result: To Buddha of non-dual expanse and pristine awareness, virtue accumulations are immeasurable. From Jewel Array: "Perfectly completed Buddha's miracles immeasurable, uncalculable, ungraspable, immeasurable. Buddha's appearance transcends big-small extremes, like space. Buddha's power transcends is-isn't extremes, like great elephant. Buddha's capacity transcends abandonment-obtainment extremes, like lion. Buddha's virtue transcends empty-full extremes, like wish-fulfilling jewel. Buddha's nature transcends self-conception extremes, all-pervading pristine awareness itself. Buddha's abiding mode transcends faculties and objects, self-appearance itself. These are self-arisen intent's own words."

From Self-Arising: "Perfectly completed Buddha's intent has no limit. Buddha's realization immeasurable. Wisdom without calculation. No good-bad in abodes. No is-isn't in view. No edge-limit in ground. No transfer-change in path. No cause-return in result. Pristine awareness without clear-obscure. Wisdom without mind."

[15988-16000]
Thus, Buddha actual ground, result perfected, no path for self to traverse. Buddhas Bhagavans are explained from the object as "path-cutter, entry-cutter, elaboration and existence guide cutter."

Emaho! Thus is completion. Buddha has nowhere to go, nothing to become, nothing to do—yet benefits flow like a river. This is the perfection that is not achieved but recognized. One should not look for it elsewhere—it is the very awareness reading these words.

[16001-16004]
Listen! With reference to compassion's path body guiding trainees, pristine awareness and activity appearing externally, accomplishing benefit, this is explained as "path of no-more-learning." Third: Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance in two parts: Identifying ground-appearance. Extensive explanation of nature.

[16004-16023]
First has ground-appearance itself and refuting wrong understandings. First: Dharmakaya of abandonment-realization ultimate, primordially pure spontaneously accomplished jewel womb—that is body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. That too, essence empty-clear self-arising pristine awareness, nowhere established as anything, nowhere divided, without making, without division, transcending speech, thought, expression, liberated from samsara-nirvana extremes, like sky nowhere established, yet becoming ground-appearance of all immeasurable virtues arising like sun, moon, planets, stars—therefore called pristine awareness perfection body.

From Thal 'gyur: "Buddhas' suchness—undivided, non-dividing, equal—how can sound, words, names exist? Reference-basis self-pure confusion pure, samsara-nirvana not famous as names. Unarisen, unborn, without cessation, all-arising pristine awareness, what is not?" Thus.

Emaho! This is the nature. Not established anywhere, yet the source of all virtues. As space contains all worlds, yet is not confined by them. One should not make it a thing, nor deny its function—let it be naturally perfect.

[16023-16044]
"Suchness self-dissolved: Elements dissolved, dust and atoms finally ceased, even particles don't abide. Afflictions dissolved, confusion and conception-free attachment not abiding, latencies and all-arising, even dust-particles don't abide. Thus by dissolving coarse and subtle, five aggregates too gradually subtle. Four elements' body exhausted, all pristine awareness perfection body. Concept-free samadhi self-abiding, transcending artificial dharmas, therefore 'dharma' doesn't abide as word." Thus.

Second has three: Positing the position. Refuting it. Establishing correct system. First: Some early masters say...

One should not be shocked by 'dissolved' and 'ceased'—this is not destruction. It is the recognition that all these 'things' were never solid to begin with. As waking from a dream—the dream did not go anywhere, one just recognized it was a dream. The aggregates do not need to be destroyed—they need to be recognized as the display of awareness.

[16025-16026]
The karmic winds become pure and stainless, released into the wisdom-wind domain.

Like a snare catching something far away, then liberated at a distance. But what distance? The distance between you and yourself. That distance has no measure—it never existed!

Thus have I examined the completion of the path. Liberation is not to be sought elsewhere—it abides right here, closer than one's own breath. This is the profound instruction.

Emaho! Liberated where one stands.

[16045-16048]
Listen carefully! Some say at the time of perfectly manifest Buddhahood, that primordial purity is nowhere established as anything, so there's no body and pristine awareness dharma either, and no ground-appearance. Some others say: Body and pristine awareness actually abide, and without that, it would follow that result Dharmakaya and pristine awareness were not obtained, or obtained then lost.

[16048-16056]
Refuting these has two parts: Reasoning: According to the first position, it would follow that Buddha lacks pristine awareness, so own-benefit and other-benefit don't arise—because no difference from empty space without anything. According to the second position, it would follow that Dharmakaya exists like substantial entities with marks, coarse material, like some substantialist proponents—because form self-characteristics are established, and aspect pristine awareness actually established, so no difference from conceptions.

Emaho! Longchenpa is destroying two extremes! Some say Buddha is just emptiness—nothing at all. Others say Buddha is a solid, permanent thing. Both are wrong! Buddha is beyond existence and non-existence, beyond permanence and annihilation. Like trying to describe space—can't say it's a thing, can't say it's nothing!

[16056-16073]
Scriptural refutation: From Six Expanses: "Without two knowable pristine awareness, what difference from material things? Or else, completely empty, this itself only changes." Thus. From Illuminating Lamp: "Thus without pristine awareness aspect, difference from external empty space exists. Therefore from ground pristine awareness pervades. Without pristine awareness, empty and different, nothing becomes. If coarse pristine awareness exists, equal to conceptions." Thus.

These scriptures show: without the clear aspect of awareness, Buddhahood is just nihilism. But if you make it a coarse, graspable thing, it's no different from ordinary thoughts. The middle way is recognition—luminous, clear, yet ungraspable!

[16073-16079]
Third, correct system: In primordially pure own-face, nowhere established as anything, transcending existence-nonexistence extremes, body and pristine awareness established like crystal. In that state or expanse or aspect, extremely subtle pristine awareness ground-appearance aspect abides triply stacked, like light inside crystal—though not directly visible object, abides as ground-appearance. Those three pristine awarenesses exist, becoming source of all body and pristine awareness. Dharmakaya unmoving, yet form body and activity appearing to trainees capable of appearing—this capability arises from that crucial point. If not thus, Buddha would be one taste with...

This is the key! Your nature is like a crystal—clear, empty, yet containing the potential for all light. The three wisdoms are always present, just not always manifest. Recognition doesn't create them—it reveals what's always been there!

[16080-16088]
Listen! Without that pristine awareness, there would be no benefit for sentient beings and no immeasurable Buddha dharmas at all. From Samcaya: "Without pristine awareness, virtues don't increase, enlightenment and ocean-like Buddha dharmas also become non-existent." Thus.

That too, "without pristine awareness" statements are the perspective that essence is nowhere established. "Pristine awareness exists" statements speak of spontaneously accomplished nature aspect—no contradiction, primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished non-dual.

Emaho! This is the Great Perfection view. Not existence, not non-existence—beyond both. As space: one cannot say it exists (where is it?), one cannot say it does not exist (it is undeniable). Pristine awareness is the same—one should not make it a thing, nor deny its vivid clarity.

[16088-16100]
Second, extensive explanation of nature: In primordially pure expanse's Dharmakaya state, pristine awareness spontaneously accomplished abides as subtle nature. Ground-abiding pristine awareness actually abides subtly. From its aspect, five characteristics-holding pristine awarenesses and knowable-knowing pristine awareness actually exist as ground-appearance aspect, not yet manifest.

From Thal 'gyur: "That too when mind ripens, abides as Dharmakaya's ground. Primordially pure, stains exhausted. Essence primordially without confusion. Appearance-maker unceased spontaneously accomplished." Thus.

One should not think ripening is becoming something new. It is like ice melting into water—it was always water, just temporarily solid. The mind is always pristine awareness, just temporarily obscured. Ripening is recognition, not manufacture.

[16100-16114]
That too, in primordially pure expanse, spontaneously accomplished abiding causes essence-nature-compassion aspects to actually appear subtly. Those three ground-abiding pristine awarenesses serving as ground-appearance for other two pristine awarenesses—from that itself: "Thus in liberated mind itself, not without compassion. By ground-abiding pristine awareness, natural dynamic ground-appearance made. By characteristic-holding pristine awareness, purified by conditions, ripening made. By knowing and knowable pristine awareness, to faithful ones, siddhi given." Thus.

The manner of those three ground-abiding ones making ground-appearance: Essence making three kayas' ground-appearance, yet three kayas different-appearance aspect not established. Nature making five lights' ground-appearance, yet colors self-characteristics not established.

This is subtle! The three kayas appear different, yet their ground is the same. The five lights appear different colors, yet they're not truly separate. Like different notes from one flute—distinct, yet from one source!

[16115-16129]
Listen! Compassion serves as the ground-appearance for two pristine awarenesses, yet there's no direct measurement of objects and aspects. From Thal 'gyur: "That too abiding as essence-body, dharmas and Dharma enjoyment emanation aspect, without dividing, without division mode, established from manner, from that—body colors, etc., not mind's object. Nature appearing-maker light mode. White, red, yellow, green, blue—not mark possessing entities, established from class-free knowables' manner. From compassion's various appearances, not one certain like this, therefore called 'ground' for various appearances."

Emaho! The colors and forms are not solid things—they are the play of light, the natural radiance of awareness. As a rainbow has no substantial existence yet appears vividly, so the kayas appear without being 'things.' One should not grasp at forms, nor reject them—let them be the spontaneous display.

[16130-16152]
From Six Expanses too: "Possessing marks self-pure, abiding as ground of great clear depth. Empty of pervader and pervaded, not cut from edge, appearing clear. Appearing-maker appearance aspect not ceased. All essences gathered, stainless, self-pure. Buddhas' great secret, abiding in nature's aspect. From compassion's various appearance aspects, emptiness aspect without cessation. Two knowable pristine awarenesses appear from appearance aspect. From non-existence's self-pure appearance, natural dynamic compassion, without effort of activity, without division in unmade appearance mode, primordially without division appears. Like sun's light, not self-made, nature itself thus appears."

Thus is described how the display works. Compassion is not something Buddha 'does'—it is what awareness naturally does, as light naturally illuminates. The five colors are not 'out there'—they are the way awareness displays itself. One should not solidify, nor reject—recognize the play.

[16153-16175]
"Knowing knowables as they are, compassion aspect's pristine awareness, knowing own thing's mode. Without that pristine awareness' aspect, what's the difference from four elements' forms? Knowing all knowables, compassion's pristine awareness, knowing trainees' thoughts. Without this, equal to mere space. Therefore all-knowing pristine awareness appears in compassion's aspect. Not held by memory, abiding as nature itself. Grasping-grasped coarsely not abiding. Clear depth subtle aspect appearing, this is sentient beings' path. Increasing like seed above. This appearance not ceased, like suitable medicine's power, appearing suitably to six families. Therefore compassion."

Don't you see? This "compassion" isn't sentiment—it's the knowing-quality of awareness itself. Without it, Buddha would be no different from a rock. With it, Buddha knows all beings' needs without effort, like a mirror reflecting without deciding what to reflect!

[16175-16176]
That too from ground-appearance aspect, when appearing as Nirmanakaya, the two pristine awarenesses also actually benefit the six families of trainees...

This is the completion of the explanation—showing how the three kayas and five wisdoms actually function to benefit beings. Not theoretical, not abstract—this is the living reality of awakening!

[16176-16191]
Listen! In primordially pure time, here, truly, non-existent, existing as seed-element mode. From Six Expanses too: "Essence, nature, and compassion's appearances appear to intelligent ones. Essence nowhere established, nature appears as clear appearance aspect. From compassion aspect, two pristine awarenesses arise without actor and action. Arising-appearance for two intellect levels, thus such pristine awareness activity appears free from effort and accomplishment. Buddhas' pristine awareness appears thus from the ground." Thus it is said.

Emaho! This is the key to understanding how enlightenment appears! Essence—empty, unestablished. Nature—clear, luminous. Compassion—unobstructed, appearing. These three aren't separate things—they're inseparable aspects of your own rigpa. The "two pristine awarenesses" appear according to the capacity of the perceiver. To deluded mind, they appear as samsara. To pure mind, as nirvana. Same display, different recognition!

Thus, expanse and pristine awareness non-dual Dharmakaya ultimate is called "great primordially pure liberation place of non-dual primordially pure spontaneously accomplished." Though abiding as nature's ground-appearance, essence nowhere established, ultimate truth sole completely perfect, great perfection, transcending body and pristine awareness, sky-like suchness is ultimate result, great internal expanse, unsurpassed liberation place, body-speech-mind non-dual vajra secret spontaneously accomplished jewel womb. From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Tathagatas don't have arising and abiding in body. Why? Tathagatas lack body as substantial thing. Tathagatas' speech doesn't have transformable and untransformable. Why? Tathagatas' speech is empty. Tathagatas' mind doesn't have thinking and not-thinking. Why? Tathagatas' mind is free from conceptions." Thus. And from Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra Diamond Cutter too: "Those who see me in form, who know me in sound, entered into wrong rejection—those people don't see me. Guides are Dharmakaya. Suchness is not knowable. That cannot be known." Thus spoken.

This is radical! The Buddha has no body, no speech, no mind in the conventional sense. Don't misunderstand—this doesn't mean nothing exists. It means nothing exists as a solid, graspable, permanent "thing." The Dharmakaya is not an object of knowledge—it's the knowing itself!

[16218-16243]
Prasangika-Madhyamikas hold actual Buddha as that pure empty Dharmakaya...

Longchenpa is engaging with philosophical positions here. He's showing that even the highest common vehicle view—Dharmakaya as emptiness—is a stepping stone to the Dzogchen view. Don't cling even to emptiness! The empty nature is not a void—it's the luminous clarity that knows itself. This is the view that cuts through all extremes while naturally expressing great compassion!

[16219-16228]
Listen carefully! In one's own face, existence-nonexistence elaboration pacified, not even established as mere body and pristine awareness. Other-appearance as Buddha's compassion and trainees' aspiration prayers, form body and activity appearing together, this is like garuda's offering-pillar, wish-fulfilling jewel, and wish-fulfilling tree. From Avatamsaka: "Peaceful body clear like wish-fulfilling tree, like wish-fulfilling jewel, without conceptions, benefiting sentient beings' world until liberation, always. This appears while free from elaboration." Thus.

Emaho! What a metaphor! The Buddha's appearance isn't like a person deciding to help—it's as natural as a wish-fulfilling jewel granting wishes without intention. The garuda's offering-pillar appears spontaneously without being constructed. Your own nature, when recognized, benefits beings without you "trying to be compassionate." This is effortless compassion—much more profound than manufactured kindness!

[16228-16233]
Here too, though similar to primordially pure's own face, from subtle pristine awareness existing in expanse, body and pristine awareness appear. Doing benefit for those who made aspiration prayers to be actually benefited by Buddha through it. Distinguished by the special feature of being spontaneously accomplished from essence aspect, not wishing to be produced by cause-aspiration prayers.

These are crucial points of primordially pure result—wise ones should know with very refined intelligence!

Don't miss this! The benefit to beings doesn't happen because Buddha "decides" to help. It happens spontaneously because that's the nature of awareness. Like the sun shining—it's not deciding to warm each person, it just shines. The aspiration prayers of beings align with this natural compassion, but they don't create it!

[16233-16242]
Second general meaning: Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance in two parts: General presentation of body divisions. Specifically explaining nature of three kayas. First has five: Explained as one body: Ground awareness one. Path awareness place one. Result awareness stainless primordially pure one—from this perspective, the unchanging vajra body, empty, heart of pristine awareness, spontaneously accomplished jewel womb, first Buddha, sky-like free from extremes.

From Self-Arising: Emaho! Great appearance, great clarity. Pure sky, free from limits. Elaboration-free suchness, unchanging. Free from extremes, center, directions, parts. Self-appearance dharmadhatu pure field. First Buddha, without cause. Last, not produced by conditions. Empty pristine awareness heart-endowed. Not abiding extremes, vajra body. Elaboration-free suchness...

This verse is magnificent! Don't read it as poetry—read it as your own nature described! "First Buddha without cause"—your nature was never created. "Not produced by conditions"—no circumstances can make or unmake it. "Empty pristine awareness"—the heart of wisdom that's always been yours!

[16255-16261]
Listen to this verse! "Lord of essence-nature-compassion, three kayas of pristine awareness luminous clarity. In sky, sun rising, dispelling darkness. Five pristine awarenesses' characteristics clear. Buddha emanations manifoldly arising." Thus it is said.

Emaho! What a description! Your own nature—essence, nature, and compassion—is the three kayas. Not somewhere else, not later, not after practice! Right now, as the clarity of awareness, dispelling the darkness of confusion like the sun in the sky. The five wisdoms aren't accomplishments—they're the natural radiance of rigpa!

[16261-16277]
Divided into two bodies: Ground primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished non-dual awareness. Path expanse and pristine awareness taken into experience. Result Dharmakaya appearing as two types, dual purpose perfected. From Thal 'gyur: "From Dharmakaya, form bodies appear clear." Thus.

Divided into three kayas: From essence aspect, empty-aware-knowing pristine awareness Dharmakaya. Self-appearance luminous clarity Sambhogakaya. Various Nirmanakaya. From Mu Tig Phreng Ba: "Three kayas, sole Buddha, five pristine awareness characteristics endowed. Abiding mode established by knowables' manner." Thus.

Don't think these divisions are real separations! They're pedagogical tools. Like describing water as H2O, as wet, as clear, as thirst-quenching—different descriptions, same water!

[16277-16298]
Divided into four bodies: Three kayas' suchness, free from one-and-many extremes, Svabhavikakaya. Powers, fearlessnesses, eighteen unmixed dharmas, etc., awareness qualities realized, samadhi, superknowledges, great compassion—these are Dharmakaya. Perfected marks and signs, abiding in Akanistha Ghanavyuha realm, Sambhogakaya. Appearing as whatever tames trainees' essence, Nirmanakaya. From Thal 'gyur: "Nirmanakaya and Sambhogakaya and Dharmakaya Svabhavikakaya." Thus.

These also appear in common treatises, matching completely. From Abhisamayalankara: "Svabhavika with Sambhogakaya, likewise others Nirmanakaya, Dharmakaya with activities." Their extensive explanation: "The Sage's Svabhavikakaya, whatever unstained dharmas obtained, completely pure in all ways, those possessing characteristic nature." Thus.

Longchenpa is showing how Dzogchen integrates with common Mahayana. The four kayas of common vehicles are not rejected—they're included as aspects of the Dzogchen view. This is the "higher" vehicle not because it contradicts lower ones, but because it encompasses them while going beyond!

[16299-16314]
Look at these verses from the Sutras! "The Sage's unique qualities, the eighteen explained, and the knowledge of all aspects—this is called Dharmakaya." The thirty-two marks and eighty excellent signs—this body, for the Great Vehicle's enjoyment, the Sage's Sambhogakaya is asserted. "Whatever benefit for beings in samsara equally performed—that body is the Sage's continuous Nirmanakaya." Thus it is said!

Emaho! The Buddha's qualities are not decorations—they're the natural expression of recognition! Like the sun's rays aren't separate from the sun, the kayas aren't separate from awareness. Longchenpa is quoting the Sutras to show the common vehicle's understanding before revealing the uncommon Dzogchen view.

[16314-16327]
Divided into five bodies: Body of Manifest Perfect Enlightenment, abandonment-realization liberation-perfected peaceful attainment. Body of Unchanging Vajra, unchanging without transformation from primordially pure expanse. Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—five. From Self-Perfected: "Five bodies, five pristine awarenesses." Thus it is said. From Self-Arising: "Five bodies of unchanging meaning abide." Thus. These divisions and others are immeasurable—enough elaboration!

Don't get lost counting bodies! Whether two, three, four, or five—it's all describing aspects of your own nature. Like describing a jewel by its color, clarity, cut, and carat—different aspects, one jewel!

[16327-16328]
Second, specific explanation of the nature of three kayas: establishing meaningful connection and explaining contextual meaning in two parts.
