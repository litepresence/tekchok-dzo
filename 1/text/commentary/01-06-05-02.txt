[8674] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The second joy—feeling, touching, experiencing. Between the seer and the seen, a bridge appears. Not made of stone or wood but of pure sensation. The object of experiential contact—what is it? It is the meeting itself, the moment before separation, the joining before distinction.

[8674] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Feeling. Contact. Empty. You think you touch something solid? You touch space dressed as form. You feel warmth? You feel the recognition of warmth. The experience arises and dissolves in the same instant. Do not build a house on this shifting ground.

[8674] Voice 13 (Patrul): Hah! This feeling—they chase it like dogs after bitches in heat! "More bliss! More sensation!" they cry. This old fool has seen them fall into the pit of attachment, grasping at pleasant feelings like a miser grasping gold coins. The second joy is the hook that catches the big fish. Don't be the fish.

[8674] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Feel the touch of the lotus in mud. The feeling arises from contact—clean foot meets wet earth. Is the mud dirty? Is the foot clean? The feeling doesn't know these labels. It simply is. The second joy is the goddess Tara's hand upon your fevered brow—cool, present, undeniable.

[8674] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): Yesterday I stubbed my toe on a rock. The feeling shot through me like lightning. In that moment—no thought, no analysis, just pure sensation. That was the second joy! Not the pleasant kind, you say? Joy and pain—two sides of one coin. Feel the coin, not the face.

[8674] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Second joy represents vedana, the aggregate of feeling. Three modes present: pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. However, in tantric praxis, these are transmuted. The object of experiential contact—visaya—becomes the support for recognition. Precise analysis distinguishes between ordinary sensation and yogic sensation.

[8674] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Feel without feeling. Experience without experiencer. The second joy comes and goes like clouds across the sky. Do not build castles from these clouds. Let them pass. The sky remains unchanged.

[8674] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): FEELING! You want to feel? Feel THIS! *roar* The universe shakes with the feeling of emptiness! Every sensation is the roar of the lion! Every touch is the stroke of death's scythe! Cut through the feeling before it cuts you!
