From bodhi in the self-nature of Vajradhara, abiding as Sambhogakaya from Dharmakaya, from the five-family kaya, from arrangement of immeasurable fields... This is describing the architecture of enlightened perception. The pure lands aren't somewhere else; they're the natural display that arises when awareness recognizes itself. The text describes twenty-five stacked fields, with this Saha world (our world) at the thirteenth, surrounded by thirteen luminosity-jewel ornamented fields above, below, and in all directions. The symbolism is important: twenty-five represents the complete mandala (five families times five). Saha being at the thirteenth represents the central position—neither at the beginning nor the end, but at the heart of the display. From the Sound Thalgyur tantra, the text names various fields: Thal-ba-dbyangs below this world, Thal-ba-'dzin in the six lower worlds, Thal-ba-skyob at three right of this world, Thal-ba-brdal above six worlds, Thal-ba's be-con above nineteen worlds, Thal-ba'i-rgyun at the north-east interval. These names aren't arbitrary—they describe different qualities of the display. "Thal" relates to thalgyur, the "penetrating" quality of Dzogchen view.

The descriptions continue with elaborate imagery—wheel shapes, lotus blooming shapes, victory banners, parasols, flowers, fragrances. Don't get caught in the poetic details! This is describing the sensory richness of the Sambhogakaya dimension. In our ordinary experience, perception is filtered through contraction and grasping. In the pure lands, perception is open, radiant, and beautiful—every sense is saturated with bliss and clarity.

The "teacher's teaching gathering-expanded" in Thal-ba-brdal, the "teacher's teaching complete-two possessing" in Thal-ba's be-con—these describe how the teaching manifests differently in different dimensions based on the capacities of beings. But always, the essence is the same: pointing to the recognition of awareness.
