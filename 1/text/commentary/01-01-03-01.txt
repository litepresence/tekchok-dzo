[578-583]
Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent three days trying to count these twenty-five stacked fields on his frozen fingers. Lost track somewhere around the eleventh and fell asleep with his butter lamp sputtering. Woke up confused about whether Vajradhara was above or below, before or after. The mind wants to map this like a merchant planning a trade route—thirteenth world here, twelve worlds there, stack them like dried dung cakes for winter. But the thirteenth is just where this particular confusion happens to sit. Could have been any number. The container-contained business—snod bcud—sounds impressive until you realize your own skull contains the same arrangement. Outer world, inner world, who's counting when the lamp finally runs out of oil?

Thal-ba-dbyangs below, they say. Thal-ba-'dzin further down in the six lower worlds. This yogi once descended to one of those lower realms—called it the winter of 'that particularly bad year'—and found nothing but his own frozen breath and the echo of his stomach complaining. The names sound exotic in translation. Sound Thalgyur tantra—penetrating sound, penetrating space. Like wind through cracks in a ramshackle hermitage. The fields are called vast and beautiful, ornamented with jewels and light. Meanwhile your nose is running, the fire's dying, and you're wondering if the real pure land might simply be a dry cave with a reliable water source. But that's the joke, isn't it? The thirteenth field looks like snot and ash until you stop looking for somewhere else to be.

[595-605]
Thal-ba-'dzin, wheel-shaped, completely pure. This one sits below the six worlds—hell realms, pretas, animals, the usual suspects. The text says 'completely pure' while describing the neighborhood of your worst nightmares. A hermit might wonder: pure for whom? The hell beings aren't enjoying the view. The wheel turns whether you call it pure or impure, whether you label it Thal-ba-'dzin or 'that spot behind the outhouse.' The teaching there is called 'the Truth itself'—which sounds grand until you realize truth is just what remains after you stop lying to yourself about what you actually see. To the right of three worlds, Thal-ba-skyob, ornamented by mothers. Light and color definitively clear. Your own mother never looked this good. The vinaya field, each with their own karma and marks. Marks like the calluses on your knees from prostrations you stopped meaning years ago.

[606-618]
Above the six worlds, Thalwa Brdal blooms like a lotus. Expansive and hollow—finally, a description that matches the feeling in your chest when the breath stops and there's nothing to hold onto. White and red lights shimmering, coarse forms not appearing. This is where the practice gets slippery. You've seen lights before—usually it's just altitude sickness or the butter lamp flickering at eye level. How to know if it's the real thing? You don't. That's the point. The abhidharma extensive, completing the aeon. Nineteen worlds above this one, Thalwa's Drum. Jewels heaped like the stones you piled to mark the mountain pass before the snow covered them anyway.

[619-634]
Northeast interval—Thalwa's Current. This yogi once walked northeast for three days looking for it. Found a stupa-shaped rock, five-colored lichen growing in arrangements. Various sounds emerging, he thought, until it turned out to be his own tinnitus. Dependent arising, they call the teaching there. Arising from what? From confusion dressed as clarity, from the certainty that turns out to be another frozen footprint. The utterly pervasive Thal at twenty-one—pure perception without outer or inner. You catch a glimpse sometimes, between sleep and waking, before the mind rushes in to name and claim. Then it's gone, and you're back to wondering if you imagined the whole thing. The causal condition pervading action—meaning you can't escape your own footprints, even in the purest field. The mountain pass doesn't care if you're enlightened or not. The snow covers everything eventually.
