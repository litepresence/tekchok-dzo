Therefore. Thus. We establish the architecture. Five families, immeasurable fields, Vairochana at center—this is not spatial description but the structure of awareness knowing itself. The jewel lotus supports twenty-five stacked realms. Where do they stack? In what space? The question misunderstands the teaching. Space itself is the thirteenth realm.

[584-594]
Thirteen fields above, below, between. Thal-ba-dbyangs below—vast, beautiful, cause and condition playing freely. The teaching here is whispered not spoken. Delightful arrangement of what was never arranged. You sit in Jambudvīpa, the thirteenth, thinking it coarse. The coarseness is your perception, not the field.

This old practitioner once dreamed of flying through these realms. I passed through Thal-ba-'dzin—wheel-shaped, completely pure—and saw my own face in every spoke. The teaching there is Truth itself, they say. What does that mean? It means no one is lying to you. No one is teaching you. The wheel turns itself.

Thalwa Brdal above the six worlds—lotus-blossom shaped, extremely expansive. White and red shimmering without coarse form. This is where the abhidharma expands to fill the aeon.

Northeast intermediate—Thalwa's Current. Stupa-shaped, five arrangements, various sounds emerging. Dependent arising taught here not as philosophy but as the actual mechanism of how worlds emerge from attention. At twenty-one, the utterly pervasive: no inside, no outside. Just pervading. The causal condition pervading action—your next breath is already there, waiting for you to notice.
