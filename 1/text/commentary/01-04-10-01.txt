[3037-3039]
Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent years looking for the "mind without basis" that texts describe. He searched through meditation after meditation, looking for something that had no foundation. One winter morning, while watching ice form on his window, he realized the ice had no basis either—it was just water taking shape. The water had no basis—just conditions coming together. The conditions had no basis—just endless interdependence. He stopped looking and laughed. The tea in his cup had gone cold. That seemed important somehow. The Svatantrika-Prasangika distinction is subtle. Both are Madhyamaka. Both teach emptiness. But their methods differ. Svatantrika uses logic to establish emptiness. Prasangika uses logic to destroy all positions, including the position of emptiness.

Two divisions: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who abide nowhere. This is the Svatantrika distinction. Lower Svatantrikas say illusion-like existence is ultimate truth. Higher Svatantrikas say not even that is established. This hermit prefers the higher view, but respects the lower. It's like the difference between saying "the mirage looks like water" and saying "the mirage is not even established as looking like water." Both true. Second more subtle. Both lead to liberation.

The first position: objects and perceivers aren't established, but non-established awareness-wisdom, inexpressible in words or thought, exists ultimately in the manner of illusion. From the Mother Sutra: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Even nirvana is like a dream, like an illusion." This old practitioner memorized that verse. Recited it daily for ten years. Then one morning forgot it. That forgetting was more liberating than a thousand recitations.

[3053-3061]
The second position says that ultimately not even illusion is established. Without objects or aspects, even self-cognizing experience of their absence doesn't exist—like without a daughter there's no consciousness apprehending her. Conventionally not truly existent, ultimately nothing abides. When waking from a dream, the appearance of horse and cow ceases, yet... yet what? This old practitioner has been sitting with that "yet" for thirty years.
