[3037-3039] Some yogi spent years looking for the "mind without basis" that texts describe. He searched through meditation after meditation, looking for something that had no foundation. One winter morning, while watching ice form on his window, he realized the ice had no basis either—it was just water taking shape. The water had no basis—just conditions coming together. The conditions had no basis—just endless interdependence. He stopped looking and laughed. The tea in his cup had gone cold. That seemed important somehow.

[3037-3039] The Svātantrika-Prasaṅgika debate—my grandfather used to say these were just two ways of saying "don't hold onto anything." The Svātantrikas want to use logic to get you there, step by step. The Prasaṅgikas just show you the absurdity of whatever you believe. Different temperaments, same destination. Like some people need to walk around the mountain, others can just look and see it's not there.

[3037-3039] Those who say illusion is ultimate—they're like someone who wakes from a dream and tries to hold onto the dream's clarity. Yes, it was vivid. Yes, it felt real. But holding onto that vividness misses the point. The dream is gone. The waking is here. Even "waking" is just another word.

[3037-3039] The non-abiding ones—they refuse to land anywhere. Every position you offer them, they show you the hole in it. It can be frustrating if you want something to hold onto. Liberating if you realize nothing was ever held. Like trying to grab water. Your hand gets wet, but you haven't captured anything.
