Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent years looking for the "mind without basis" that texts describe. He searched through meditation after meditation, looking for something that had no foundation. One winter morning, while watching ice form on his window, he realized the ice had no basis either—it was just water taking shape. The water had no basis—just conditions coming together. The conditions had no basis—just endless interdependence. He stopped looking and laughed. The tea in his cup had gone cold. That seemed important somehow. The Svatantrika-Prasangika distinction is subtle. Both are Madhyamaka. Both teach emptiness. But their methods differ. Svatantrika uses logic to establish emptiness. Prasangika uses logic to destroy all positions, including the position of emptiness.

This old practitioner tried the same search when he was young. Looked for the "real" mind beneath the thoughts. Searched for weeks. Finally a crow landed on his tent pole and cawed three times. He looked up. That was the teaching. The mind without basis is like that crow—appearing, cawing, leaving no trace. The Svatantrikas want to use logic to get you there, step by step. Like teaching someone to walk by explaining the mechanics of legs. The Prasangikas just show you the absurdity of whatever you believe. Like pointing out that you're already walking. Different temperaments, same destination. Like some people need to walk around the mountain, others can just look and see it's not there.

Those who say illusion is ultimate—they're like someone who wakes from a dream and tries to hold onto the dream's clarity. Yes, it was vivid. Yes, it felt real. But holding onto that vividness misses the point. The dream is gone. The waking is here. Even "waking" is just another word. This yogi once kept a dream journal for three years, trying to capture the essence of dreams. One morning he woke up and couldn't find his pen. That's when the real teaching came. The lower Svatantrikas hold that illusion-like existence is ultimate truth. This is subtle! They're not saying things exist. They're saying things exist like illusions—appearing but empty, functioning but unreal. It's a middle position.

[3038-3039]
The non-abiding ones—they refuse to land anywhere. Every position you offer them, they show you the hole in it. It can be frustrating if you want something to hold onto. Liberating if you realize nothing was ever held. Like trying to grab water. Your hand gets wet, but you haven't captured anything. This old practitioner spent decades trying to capture Dzogchen in words. Finally his teacher burned all his notes. "Now," she said, "you might actually understand." The higher Svatantrikas don't even abide in illusion-like existence. They say: conventionally, things appear like illusions. But ultimately? Nothing. No existence, no non-existence, no illusion, no non-illusion.

[3037-3038]
Two divisions: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who abide nowhere. This is the Svatantrika distinction. Lower Svatantrikas say illusion-like existence is ultimate truth. Higher Svatantrikas say not even that is established. This hermit prefers the higher view, but respects the lower. It's like the difference between saying "the mirage looks like water" and saying "the mirage is not even established as looking like water." Both true. Second more subtle. Both lead to liberation. The Svatantrika approach is systematic. They present the view clearly. They establish positions carefully. This is helpful for many practitioners. You need to know what you're doing.

[3037-3039]
The ultimate truth: not established, self-arisen, without basis. These words point to what cannot be pointed to. Every time you think you understand, you've missed it. The understanding is the obstacle. The mind that seeks the mind without basis is itself the basis. Stop seeking. What remains? Not nothing. Not something. Just—this. Whatever this is. This old practitioner has been sitting with "this" for thirty years. Still fresh. Still mysterious. The Prasangika approach is more direct. They don't establish positions. They just negate yours. This can be disorienting. But it's faster. Like pulling a bandage off quickly. Painful for a moment. Then relief.

[3037-3039]
Svatantrika means "those who use their own reasoning." They construct arguments, establish positions, use logic. Prasangika means "those who use consequences." They show the absurd results of your positions, without establishing their own. Both lead to emptiness. But Prasangika is sharper, quicker. Like cutting with a sword versus cutting with a knife. Same result, different method. This hermit has learned from both. Uses both. Holds neither. The progression from Mind-Only to Svatantrika to Prasangika is like removing layers of clothing. First you take off the heavy coat of materialism. Then the shirt of Mind-Only. Then the undershirt of Svatantrika. Finally, naked. Not even naked as a position. Just—skin. Air. Being.

[3037-3039]
This practitioner returns to the question: what is mind without basis? He has no answer. The question itself dissolves like morning mist. Who asks? Who answers? What is basis? What is no-basis? Words pile up like snow. Eventually, you stop shoveling. Let the snow cover everything. The world becomes white. Silent. That white silence is closer to truth than any words. The Svatantrika path is like climbing a mountain. You need steps, you need rest stops, you need a clear trail. The Prasangika path is like jumping off a cliff. You need courage, you need trust, you need to let go completely. Both lead to the same view. Choose based on your capacity.

[3038-3039]
The two divisions within Svatantrika correspond to stages of understanding. First, you realize things are like illusions. This undermines your grasping at solidity. Then you realize even illusion-like existence is not ultimately established. This undermines your grasping at the view itself. This is the progression. Not from wrong to right. From less subtle to more subtle. From more grasping to less grasping. Until finally—no grasping at all. Not even grasping at non-grasping. This is the completion of the path. The Madhyamaka fulfillment. The emptiness of emptiness. The great freedom.

[3037-3039]
This hermit returns to the ice on the window. The hermit who watched it form and realized it had no basis. This is the insight. Everything appears dependently. Everything lacks inherent existence. The appearance depends on conditions. The conditions depend on other conditions. Endlessly. No first cause. No final basis. Just—dependent arising. Just—emptiness. This is not scary. This is liberating. It means you're not trapped. It means anything can change. It means the nature of reality is openness, possibility, freedom. This is the Svatantrika-Prasangika teaching. This is the Middle Way.

[3037-3039]
The distinction between Svatantrika and Prasangika is important for scholars. For practitioners? Just practice. Sit. Look at your mind. See what's there. See what's not there. The classifications won't help you do that. Only doing it will help. This old practitioner has studied both schools. Can debate the differences. And? The debating doesn't liberate. The studying doesn't free. Only seeing through the one who studies, who debates. That's the liberation. The schools are maps. You have to walk the territory. The Svatantrika map has more detail. The Prasangika map is more direct. Both get you there. Just walk.

Emaho! Svatantrika, Prasangika, abiding, non-abiding—just fingers pointing. Don't suck the finger when the moon is so clearly visible. Don't worship the map when the territory is right here. Don't cling to the raft when you can swim. The teachings are tools. Use them. Then put them down. The goal is not to master the teachings. The goal is to master yourself. To see your own nature. To be free. This is the way. This is the truth. This is the life. Emaho!
