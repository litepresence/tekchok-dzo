# Commentary: 01-04-10-01 - Middle Way: Illusion as Ultimate

## Voice 02 (Systematizer) - Precision Analysis

[3037-3039]
Thus, various appearances appear— aspects and measurers non-apparent, merely clarity. In ultimate truth, not only the self-aware wisdom of one's own nature is non-existent by its very essence.

In this, there is division: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who are completely non-abiding—these two.

The Middle Way school, even within the Autonomous branch, divides further. Some assert illusion-like nature as ultimate truth. Others go further—complete non-abiding.

## Voice 10 (Longchenpa) - Vast Middle Way

[3037-3039]
Beyond Mind-Only's self-awareness—the Middle Way opens like infinite sky. Various appearances, yet aspects and measurers unapparent. Merely clarity, yet not even that is established ultimately.

Illusion as ultimate? A step beyond. Completely non-abiding? Further still. Like waves recognizing they are water, yet the water itself has no essence to grasp.

## Voice 13 (Patrul) - Earthy Practitioner

[3037-3039]
This old practitioner has seen many magicians. They make things appear—flowers from empty space, birds from nowhere. Is the illusion real? Is it unreal? 

The Autonomous Middle-Way school says: like illusion, phenomena appear but have no essence. A middle ground between existence and non-existence.

But some say even "illusion" is too much to assert. Like saying "this mirage is water"—even "mirage" is a concept. Cut even that!

Stop. Recognize. Liberate.

Various appearances. Non-apparent aspects. Merely clarity. Not established ultimately.

Illusion as ultimate? Non-abiding? Both positions. Both views. Cut through both.
