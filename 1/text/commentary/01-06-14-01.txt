[9703] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
First, regarding essence: through the binding of the continuum by means of mantra samaya.
The tantra speaks of protection from the sworn antidote-army without emitting.
This is the secret binding—not a chain that imprisons but a recognition that liberates.
The mantra samaya is not a vow to be kept but a state to be recognized.

[9703] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
Three words. See your nature. Rest.
What is the essence of mantra? Not the syllables. Not the sound.
The essence is the recognition that sound and emptiness are indivisible.
Bind this recognition to the continuum of your awareness.
Protect it by not protecting it—let it be as it is, without emission, without grasping.

[9703] Voice 13 (Patrul):
They take their samaya like a snake swallowing a rat—reluctantly, fearfully!
"I must keep my vows!" they cry, sweating in their vigilance.
This old man tells you—the binding happens naturally when you recognize your nature.
No effort needed. No vigilance required.
The antidote-army? Just thoughts. Don't emit them into action. Simple.

[9703] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
The mantra samaya is the samaya of the vajra heart.
In the secret chamber of your heart, the deity whispers the essence mantra.
Not loudly—just a breath, just a hint.
Bind this whisper to your life-force, and no harm can come.
The antidote-army of demons and obstacles—they become your servants, your protectors.

[9703] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
I bound my dog with a rope this morning—poor beast kept running into the road.
But the rope just made him struggle more. Then I sat with him, and he calmed.
The binding that works is not the rope but the understanding.
The mantra samaya is like sitting with your mind until it calms. No rope needed.

[9703] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
Consequently.
Binding—sdams pa—indicates the samadhi of sealing.
The continuum—rgyud—refers to the tantra, the continuous flow.
Precise analysis: without emitting—mi 'pha' ba—indicates the non-dispersal of bindu and the non-departure from the natural state.

[9703] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
The essence cannot be bound. What is bound is the recognition of essence.
Rest in that recognition, and the binding completes itself.
No army can harm what has no location. No antidote can cure what is not sick.
Protection is the natural radiance of resting.

[9703] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced):
BINDING? You want to bind the ESSENCE?
The essence binds nothing and is bound by nothing!
The antidote-army is your own creation! Without emitting? EMIT EVERYTHING!
Let it all out! The scream, the roar, the silence!
Hesitation itself—does it have a root? Look closely, and it dissolves.

[9703] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
The essence of mantra samaya is without essence. This is the supreme secret.
To bind this unbindable, to protect this unprotectable—this is the play of the dakinis.
They laugh at our efforts, yet they bless them.
The antidote-army marches in formation, but the wise practitioner sees empty space in military costume.
