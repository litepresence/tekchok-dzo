First: two root tantras. Relying on eight root scriptures of perfect self-arisen: outer elaborations empower and ripen those who enjoy elaboration. Relying on six chapters of letterless tantra: upadesha points that ripen and liberate. Second: explanatory mother and child tantras. Eighty-six chapters of Rigpa Self-Arisen: view, meditation, conduct, result. Nine chapters of Rigpa Self-Liberated: elimination of mother's ground object.

[4659-4678]
Third: two limb tantras. Jewel Heap five chapters: qualities complete in themselves. Blazing Body-Relic three chapters: signs of body, speech, mind past and present. Fourth: two scripture-logic clear tantras. Sudden Sound six chapters: root of all scriptural collections. Auspicious Beauty seven chapters: identifying delusion's time. Fifth: four upadesha tantras. Vajra-Sattva Heart-Mirror eight chapters: introduction, meeting, empowerment, samaya. Samantabhadra Mind-Mirror seven chapters: deviation and obscuration elimination.

[4679-4698]
Sixth: three intention self-position tantras. Six Spaces six chapters: purifying six consciousnesses' birth-places, emptying three realms. Blazing Lamp four chapters: four actual lamps. Sun-Moon-Joined four chapters: carrying four intermediate states on path. Seventh: two entering self-liberation tantras. Lion-Power Dzogchen thirteen chapters: bringing out view's form. Jewel Arrangement fourteen chapters: entering yogi's path. Eighth: expert ritual tantras. Black Wrathful 108 chapters: protecting supreme teachings.

From Pearl Garland: All tantras—supreme wonder! Two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence. Two explanatory mother-child tantras: leaves spreading. Two limb tantras: planets and stars from oceans. Two scripture-logic clear tantras: flowers opening. Four upadesha tantras: ripening results. Three intention-self-abiding tantras: seeing the peak. Two entering-self-liberation tantras: mindful basis and heart. Expert ritual tantras: messenger dog.

[4719-4738]
Reason for eight sections: Without two root tantras, like trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise. Without explanatory mother-child, like no leaves—no flowers. Without limb tantras, like climbing cliff without limbs—falling. Without entering self-liberation, like corpse without heart—cannot benefit others. Without scripture-logic clear, like no flowers—results do not ripen.

[4739-4758]
Without four upadesha tantras, like no results—agriculture meaningless. Without three intention self-abiding, like person without eyes—cannot enter city. Without expert ritual tantra, like watchdog gone—wealth lost to thieves. Thus lacking eight, teaching's condition incomplete. If exist, complete. Eight appropriate and certain. More than that: not needed.
