First: two root tantras. Relying on eight root scriptures of perfect self-arisen: outer elaborations empower and ripen those who enjoy elaboration. Relying on six chapters of letterless tantra: upadesha points that ripen and liberate. Second: explanatory mother and child tantras. Eighty-six chapters of Rigpa Self-Arisen: view, meditation, conduct, result. Nine chapters of Rigpa Self-Liberated: elimination of mother's ground object.

[4659-4678]
Third: two limb tantras. Jewel Heap five chapters: qualities complete in themselves. Blazing Body-Relic three chapters: signs of body, speech, mind past and present. Fourth: two scripture-logic clear tantras. Sudden Sound six chapters: root of all scriptural collections. Auspicious Beauty seven chapters: identifying delusion's time. Fifth: four upadesha tantras. Vajra-Sattva Heart-Mirror eight chapters: introduction, meeting, empowerment, samaya. Samantabhadra Mind-Mirror seven chapters: deviation and obscuration elimination.

[4679-4698]
Sixth: three intention self-position tantras. Six Spaces six chapters: purifying six consciousnesses' birth-places, emptying three realms. Blazing Lamp four chapters: four actual lamps. Sun-Moon-Joined four chapters: carrying four intermediate states on path. Seventh: two entering self-liberation tantras. Lion-Power Dzogchen thirteen chapters: bringing out view's form. Jewel Arrangement fourteen chapters: entering yogi's path. Eighth: expert ritual tantras. Black Wrathful 108 chapters: protecting supreme teachings.

[4699-4718]
From Pearl Garland: All tantras—supreme wonder! Two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence. Two explanatory mother-child tantras: leaves spreading. Two limb tantras: planets and stars from oceans. Two scripture-logic clear tantras: flowers opening. Four upadesha tantras: ripening results. Three intention-self-abiding tantras: seeing the peak. Two entering-self-liberation tantras: mindful basis and heart. Expert ritual tantras: messenger dog.

[4719-4738]
Reason for eight sections: Without two root tantras, like trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise. Without explanatory mother-child, like no leaves—no flowers. Without limb tantras, like climbing cliff without limbs—falling. Without entering self-liberation, like corpse without heart—cannot benefit others. Without scripture-logic clear, like no flowers—results do not ripen.

[4739-4758]
Without four upadesha tantras, like no results—agriculture meaningless. Without three intention self-abiding, like person without eyes—cannot enter city. Without expert ritual tantra, like watchdog gone—wealth lost to thieves. Thus lacking eight, teaching's condition incomplete. If exist, complete. Eight appropriate and certain. More than that: not needed.

[4759-4778]
Therefore. Thus. The eight sections are like the eight organs of a body—each necessary, each performing its function. The root tantras are the heart. The explanatory tantras are the lungs. The limb tantras are the limbs. Without any one, the body cannot function. The teaching cannot stand. This practitioner has studied all eight. He has memorized their chapters. Now he sees: the eight are one. The one is awareness.

[4779-4798]
Three words that unlock the eight sections: recognition itself. The tantras do not teach anything new. They point to what is already present. The root points to the basis. The explanatory points to the path. The limb tantras point to the result. All point to your own face.

[4799-4818]
An old practitioner once collected all eight sections, binding them in brocade. He carried them on pilgrimage across the plateau. At every pass, he opened them. At every river, he read them. One night in a cave, the wind scattered the pages. As he chased them by moonlight, he understood: the eight sections were not in the pages but in the moonlight, in the wind, in the chasing.

[4819-4838]
Between the root tantra and the ritual tantra, there is no hierarchy. Like eight directions from a center—each complete, each necessary. The practitioner who recognizes this stops preferring one section over another. All eight are your own awareness displayed as teaching.

[4839-4858]
This old fool has walked with these eight sections for decades. He has taught them. He has written about them. Now he says: the eight sections are like eight fingers pointing at the moon. Do not look at the fingers. Do not count them. Do not argue which finger points best. Look at the moon. Look NOW.

[4859-4878]
CUT THROUGH. Do not wait to master all eight sections. Do not wait to memorize the chapters. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is now. The eight sections are not steps to climb. They are the ground you already stand on.

[4879-4898]
Therefore. Thus. The eight sections complete the teaching. The teaching completes the sections. The one who teaches, the one who learns, the teaching itself—all are spontaneously accomplished. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the eight.

[4899-4900]
Three words: eight are one. Enough.
