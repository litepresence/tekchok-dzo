Listen well, dear yogin! That-from: effort great-small-by, day and month year all-by, individual time-to certain accomplish! Move very without time all-from, individual measure-to reach indeed—thus!

This experience take secret essential-point great! Third day night wheel manner determine four: continuum-to sense-organ essential-point-to gather, memory door close! Dawn know object vase-in put, wisdom directly clear! Morning wisdom clear-to demonstrate, arise-feeling all self-place pure! Day appear vast-by strike, sign all suppress! This formerly also explain, here also leap-over companion-as explain summary experience take, little former-and not-different distinction exist!

Day time elephant gaze-by manifest-to look, delusion-appear self-cease release sign suppress! Night time bindu empty lamp-to cognition place: bindu expand time cognition clear portion expand, decrease time cognition increasingly subtle go-from, end reference without go state, cognition reference think emanate gather without equipoise!

Sleep-to go time forehead center-in, bindu empty dissolve manner mind place having, sleep-of luminosity essence seize! Midnight-at heart within-of luminosity-to mind hold having sleep by, dream luminosity-to liberate having, habit-continuum cease! Then morning lion gaze by, bow-span-of sky-to AH white one-to consciousness place by, clear-empty elaboration-from free-of meaning within-from arise! That manner-in how-much abide meditate—Six-Expanse from!

Body-of posture press having, consciousness sky-of range-to cast! Like-that eye space-between-to, elephant-of gaze by, memory-without great-spreading great-as place! Like-that awareness sky-to place, this-from separate without! Yogin continuum-by what meditate: daytime appear expand-spread, nighttime self-of place house-in! Time four equal-of measure hold, sense-organ door all self-gather having, bindu empty-of lamp-to yogin endowed mind place!

Emaho! Day-night wheel of luminosity!

Listen, practitioner! Bindu itself expand time, consciousness itself expand place! Like-that bindu subtle become time, bindu increasingly-subtle-to, consciousness increasingly-subtle place! Sleep-and dream essential-point by, before attachment habit-continuum root-from extract! This-like nighttime time all-in, yogin fortune-with endowed act! This-by appear self-expand reach—thus!

Like-that day-night wheel-continuum-by experience take having, delusion-appear self-cease luminosity-to liberate! That-from: body-and field-and awareness by, self-appear pure-of measure all hold! Like-that self-appear measure grasp having, six-classes delusion-of appear cease! That cease time-at, awareness measure-to reach! Like-that measure-to when reach time, self-of body-also not-appear!

Elements-by produced flesh-blood body, elements self-place-at pure cause! This field-as appear cause! Delusion-by grasped mind-of body, elements self-place-at dissolve cause! This-also not-appear self-place-at dissolve! Awareness-by grasped light-of body, water-moon mandala like! This time Dharma-nature cease-and near! This-in what familiar Buddha-field!

Then body three limit exhaust having, action-free perfect body obtain! This time body-of limit all-and free-of near! Base-at familiar yogin-by, self-of place-also empty become! Path-at familiar yogin-by, elements coarse stain exhaust! Fruit-at indeed who familiar, not-return ground-to this-by reach—thus!

Also light-body-and samadhi-body two distinction: light-body awareness self-light stain without, Buddha-eye field-from sentient-being-by see unable! Samsara-and nirvana-in conduct, fruit appear-in not-abide wisdom one-cut-as arise fruit obtain!

Emaho! Perfect body beyond elements!

[9209-9222]
The light-body and samadhi-body have differences: light-body is rigpa's self-light without stain, buddha-eye's object but unseen by sentient beings. Samadhi deity-body is ripened habitual patterns' born, extremely pure four elements' atoms, seen by sentient beings with divine eye.

This completes the commentary. The treasury has been opened, the meaning revealed—not through analysis but through recognition. Rest in that.
