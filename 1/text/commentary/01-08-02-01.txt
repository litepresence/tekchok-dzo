Spontaneous presence cannot be the basis of liberation. This is not negation—it is precision. If all were spontaneously accomplished from the beginning, who would need to practice? Who would become liberated? The path would be meaningless.

[10548-10557]
This old man once...

[10550-10557]
If the basis were merely spontaneous presence, samsara and nirvana would be one. Wherever samsara is, nirvana would be. Wherever nirvana is, samsara would be. The pure would be impure. The impure would be pure. The path dissolves into contradiction.

[10548-10560]
Therefore. Thus. We analyze the logical faults. Spontaneous presence as the sole basis fails under scrutiny. Not because it is wrong. Because it is incomplete. Like describing an elephant by its tail alone.

[10561-10584]
From Klongdrukpa: Spontaneous accomplishment being posited as the basis is truly not the correct basis. If it were, sentient beings without effort would never attain liberation. Non-recognition becomes the cause of continued obscuration. If mere awareness were sufficient for liberation, then liberation would not be distinct from ordinary existence. Like charcoal upon black earth cannot be cleaned to appear white. Cause and effect would remain separate without connection.

[10561-10584]
The tantra speaks in analogies the mind can grasp. Charcoal and black earth—same nature, different appearance. You cannot wash charcoal white. Not because washing fails. Because the nature is black. Liberation requires recognition, not just presence.

[10570-10584]
Samantabhadra declares: This teaching of spontaneous presence exists merely among conventional dharmas known by intellect. It is not the correct essence of the ultimate basis. Even the Primordial Buddha distinguishes between conventional description and ultimate reality.

[10585-10593]
Second position: uncertainty as the basis. Because awareness is not established as definite entity, it remains uncertain. Because conditions transform it, it remains without fixed nature. The Mind Section teaches: From manifold names given to uncertainty, meaning is merely labels, empty like echoes.

[10585-10593]
This practitioner once loved uncertainty. It felt spacious. Liberating. No fixed views. No certainties to defend. Then he saw: uncertainty itself becomes a fixed view. The open door becomes another prison.

[10594-10607]
Refutation: If the basis were one essence, it could not be non-one—a direct contradiction. If uncertain basis were cause of samsara, it would be determined as confusion. If basis of nirvana, determined as purity. Both cannot be true. If inherently pure, impurity cannot arise. If uncertain, samsara and nirvana mix without distinction. Buddhas would revert to confusion. The basis would become mind's possession rather than nature.

[10594-10607]
The logic is merciless. Each position examined finds its own destruction. This is not cruelty. It is compassion wearing the mask of destruction. The positions must die so recognition can live.

[10548-10607]
Three words. Spontaneous presence. Uncertainty. Both incomplete. The basis is prior to both. Prior to determination and indetermination. Prior to existence and non-existence. Find that. Rest there.

[10607]
Between the position and its refutation, the vast middle way opens. Not spontaneous presence alone. Not uncertainty alone. The unity of primordial purity and spontaneous presence. Ka dag and lhun grub as indivisible. This is the authentic Great Perfection.

[10608-10615]
Voice 20 proclaims: The second and third positions are like two blind men arguing about an elephant. One touches the leg and says "pillar." One touches the ear and says "fan." Both are wrong. Both are right. The elephant is neither and both.

[10610-10620]
Thus. We proceed...
