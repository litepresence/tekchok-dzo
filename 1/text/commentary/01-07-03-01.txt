[9990-10004] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First outer outer—falsehood abandoning. From Wheel-Stacked Tantra: mantra faith practicing, even to common beings, don't speak lies for self-desire, always happily speaking. Mantra recite power not arising, others told also not holy, self speech degenerated, become others' tongue-fall. Future time, monkey body in northern direction experience, after lower realm suffering various experiences.

[9990-10004] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Lie. Abandon. Stop. You think a lie is just words? It is the poison that enters the stream of speech. One lie, and the mantra becomes empty sound. The power doesn't arise because there is no truth to carry it.

[9990-10004] Voice 13 (Patrul): They think white lies are okay! "I didn't want to hurt their feelings!" This old man says—a lie is a lie is a lie. White, black, gray—all poison. Speak truth or speak nothing. The monkey body in the north? That's your mind, chattering lies, born in the realm of deception.

[9990-10004] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The mantra practitioner who lies is like a lotus growing from mud but smelling of perfume. The perfume doesn't hide the rot. The lie doesn't hide the deceit. Future lives as a monkey—chattering, deceiving, never still. Is that what you want?

[9990-10004] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I lied once to my wife. Small lie, about where I'd been. Then another. Then the marriage was built on lies. Took years to rebuild. One lie is never just one.

[9990-10004] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Speech samaya first level: phyi'i phyi (outer-outer)—rdzun spong (falsehood abandoning). Precise analysis: the mechanism—rdzun gyi tshig (false words) driven by rang 'dod (self-desire)—creates the condition where sngags bzlas (mantra recitation) becomes powerless.

[9990-10004] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Truth is natural. Lies are effort. Why work so hard? Rest in the truth that needs no protection. The tongue-fall of others—let them speak. Your speech remains pure.

[9990-10004] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): LIES? TRUTH? speaks with fierce compassion Both are concepts! The lion doesn't lie. The lion doesn't tell truth. The lion ROARS! See through the duality of true and false!

[10005-10035] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Speech outer inner samaya—slander not speak. From the same source: whoever entered mantra, speaks slander dividing others, Dharma assembly doesn't gather, what done becomes wrong, not associated becomes enemy, body struck by weapon, death transference stinging body, then lower realm gradually experiences. Outer secret—others' harsh words abandoning. Always harsh words speak: previous deed, later sign. Migrate world love-lacking, friend also hates, Dharma word seeks, died after very pride body, then bad-migrate three circles.

[10005-10035] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Slander. Harsh. Stop. You speak ill of another, you cut your own tongue in future lives. The division you create outside creates division inside. Assembly doesn't gather—the pieces of your mind scatter.

[10005-10035] Voice 13 (Patrul): They love gossip! "Did you hear about Rinpoche? About the lama?" This old man plugs his ears. Not interested. Your slander returns as arrows in your back. I've seen it happen.

[10005-10035] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The mantra practitioner who slanders is like a snake biting its own tail. The poison circulates. The friend becomes enemy. The Dharma assembly scatters like birds when the hunter comes. And the hunter is your own speech.

[10005-10035] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): My village had two families. Feuded for generations over slander. Now neither family speaks to the other. Children don't know why. The original slander? Forgotten. The damage? Eternal.

[10005-10035] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. phyi'i nang (outer-inner)—phra ma mi smra (slander not speak). phyi'i gsang (outer-secret)—zhe gcod spong (harsh words abandoning). Precise analysis: phra ma (slander) creates dbyen 'jug (division entering), leading to 'khor mi 'du (assembly not gathering).

[10005-10035] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Speak praise or speak silence. The middle way of speech is the way of kindness. Slander is the wind that blows out the lamp of merit.

[10005-10035] Voice 22 (Drolo): SLANDER? HARSH WORDS? The heruka's wrathful speech cuts through delusion! But your gossip cuts through nothing! SILENCE is the only true speech!

[10036-10083] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Speech inner's three: Dharma speak outer, accomplish inner, meditate secret. From Samaya Aspects Arranged Tantra: mantra one discipline dwell, to Dharma speak ones and accomplish, Dharma instructed ones, if grieve and blame, scold and disparage word speak—other's inclination degenerates, self's possession degenerates, self's dharmas forget confusion, mind-thought different uneven becomes.

[10036-10083] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Dharma. Accomplish. Meditate. Stop. Three functions of speech. Speak the teachings. Accomplish the practices. Meditate the meaning. Disparage any, and all three degenerate. The instructed ones grieve. Your own possession—merit—dries up.

[10036-10083] Voice 13 (Patrul): They criticize how others practice! "His meditation is wrong! Her view is flawed!" This old man says—let them practice. Let them be wrong. Your criticism dries up your own merit like sun on a puddle.

[10036-10083] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The Dharma speaker is the voice of the deity. The accomplisher is the hands of the deity. The meditator is the mind of the deity. Criticize any, and you cut the deity's body, speech, and mind.

[10036-10083] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I sing songs. Some like them, some don't. If I criticize other singers, my own voice tightens. Better to sing my song and let others sing theirs.

[10036-10083] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. nang gi gsum (inner's three): chos smra ba (Dharma speak)—phyi (outer), bsgrub pa (accomplish)—nang (inner), bsgom pa (meditate)—gsang (secret). Precise analysis: the three levels correspond to transmission, practice, and realization.

[10036-10083] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Speak Dharma without pride. Practice without competition. Meditate without expectation. This is the speech samaya of the inner level.

[10036-10083] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): DHARMA SPEECH? I'll give you Dharma speech! speaks with fierce compassion NO WORDS! NO TEACHING! NO ACCOMPLISHMENT! See through and FIND THE SPEECH THAT NEVER SPOKE!

[10041-10083] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Secret's three: outer disparage vajra siblings, inner guru's mudra and near circle, secret disparage guru. From Two-Joined Mudra Tantra: to vajra sibling and consort, word spoke and speech cut—kalpa hundred, lower realm suffering unbearable, this person experiences. Previous not done, present sign, gradually experiences. Previous deed this life, between finally experience, again previous life upper. This deed deed end, life mandala speech deed, assembly tongue-fall, adventitious speech stream cease. Guru's son and wife, whoever close, command transgressed, samaya transgressed—previous deed double. Guru particular, root and branch, speech transgressed, exaggeration desire words—previous deed thousand becomes, ripening unbearable, guru particular even, immediately experiences.

[10041-10083] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Secret. Guru. Speech. Stop. The outer secret—don't disparage the sangha. The inner secret—don't speak ill of the consort mandala. The secret secret—the guru's speech is your own mind's speech. To cut the guru's speech is to cut your own throat.

[10041-10083] Voice 13 (Patrul): They think they can criticize the guru in private! "He's just a man, after all." This old man covers his ears! The guru is the appearance of your own wisdom. To speak against him is to speak against your own Buddha nature.

[10041-10083] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The vajra siblings are your own channels, winds, and essences in display. The consort is the union of bliss and emptiness. The guru is the recognition itself. Speak against any, and you speak against the mandala of your own heart.

[10041-10083] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I wouldn't speak ill of my father, even in private. Not fear—respect. The guru deserves more respect than father, mother, all gods. Guard your tongue like a locked door.

[10041-10083] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. gsang ba'i gsum (secret's three): phyi—rdo rje spun smad (disparage vajra siblings), nang—bla ma'i phyag rgya (guru's mudra), gsang—bla ma smod (disparage guru). Precise analysis: karmic multiplication—previous deed becomes two times, one hundred times, one thousand times based on object hierarchy.

[10041-10083] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The secret samaya of speech is silence about the guru's form. See him as Buddha, speak of him as Buddha, think of him as Buddha. Then speech becomes offering.

[10041-10083] Voice 22 (Drolo): SEVEN, NINE, TWENTY-SEVEN SAMAYAS? CUT THEM ALL! The secret samaya is NO SAMAYA! No guru to respect! No speech to guard! See the nature (rang bzhin)!

[10084-10097] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus speech samaya divided nine. Third: mind samaya outer inner secret three. The nine samayas of speech complete. Now the mind—most subtle, most dangerous. What you think in the dark corners of consciousness shapes worlds.

[10084-10097] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Speech. Complete. Mind. Stop. Body was vessel. Speech was elixir. Mind is the drinker. Guard the drinker, for if he poisons himself, vessel and elixir are wasted.

[10084-10097] Voice 13 (Patrul): They guarded body and speech. Now mind—the hardest! This old man has seen them pious outside, raging inside. Calm face, storm mind—what's the use?

[10084-10097] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The mind samaya is the root of all. Break body samaya, repair with ritual. Break speech samaya, repair with confession. Break mind samaya—only recognition can repair. And recognition cannot be forced.

[10084-10097] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): Nine body, nine speech, nine mind—twenty-seven gates. Each harder than the last. But each leads to the same garden. Walk through.

[10084-10097] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Summary: gsung gi dam tshig (speech samaya)—nine complete. Transition to thugs kyi dam tshig (mind samaya)—three levels, each with three aspects. Precise analysis: the progression from coarse (body) to subtle (mind).

[10084-10097] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Nine plus nine plus nine—twenty-seven. But twenty-seven are one. The one is your awareness. Rest there, and all samayas complete themselves.

[10084-10097] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): TWENTY-SEVEN? I'll give you ONE! speaks with fierce compassion See through all twenty-seven and find THE MIND THAT NEVER MOVED!
Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. Rest in this understanding.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
