[1463-1470]
Therefore, the eon cycles follow precise patterns. Decrease from immeasurable to eighty-thousand, two-hundred years each decrement. Then from eighty-thousand to ten, hundred-by-hundred. This is not arbitrary but reflects the dissipation of collective merit. Each reduction in lifespan corresponds to an increase in affliction.

[1471-1478]
The reversal occurs when beings abandon the ten non-virtues. Each abandonment produces a specific increase: twenty from abandoning killing, forty from abandoning stealing, up to eighty-thousand from abandoning wrong dharma practice. This is a precise calculus of virtue—cause and effect measured in years of life.

[1479-1486]
The eighteen intermediate gaps—decrease-and-increase cycles—represent the oscillation of collective karma. Not a linear progression but a wave pattern. The system stabilizes, destabilizes, restabilizes. This continues until the final destruction.

[1487-1494]
The translator renders these calculations carefully. Each number carries meaning. The Sanskrit terms, the Tibetan equivalents, the mathematical relationships—all must be preserved. This is not merely cosmology. It is a description of how consciousness evolves and devolves through time.

[1495-1502]
The destruction proceeds through twenty intermediate eons. Nineteen destroy the essence—beings. One destroys the vessel—the world itself. This is not violence but transformation. Like a dream ending, the dreamer wakes. The destruction is not an external event but the exhaustion of collective projection.

[1503-1510]
Seven suns arise, each progressively hotter. The sequence is precise: grass and trees burn, rivers dry, great rivers dry, lakes dry, ocean dries, land burns, mountains burn. Seven fires. The mathematical progression mirrors the intensification of affliction that precedes awakening.

[1511-1518]
Then water from below dissolves what fire could not touch. Seven levels of water, dissolving to progressively subtler states. Then wind from below scatters even the water. Seven levels of wind. The sequence—fire, water, wind—corresponds to the three stages of dissolution in death and meditation.

[1519-1526]
The wanderer watches this from his cave. He sees the calculations, the precise numbers, the elaborate architecture. He laughs. Eons come and go like breath. Worlds arise and dissolve like thoughts. You worry about when it will end. It ends now. It begins now. There is no difference.

[1527-1534]
DROLO SUDDENLY APPEARS. Thunder without clouds. THE DESTRUCTION IS HAPPENING NOW. Your world is already burning. Your oceans are already dry. You are already scattered by wind. Why wait? The eon does not end in time. Time ends in the eon. Recognition is freedom.

[1535-1542]

[1543-1550]
One hundred eighty intermediate eons constitute the great eon. This is the time it takes for collective consciousness to complete one full cycle: arising, abiding, dissolving, empty. Then arising again. The wheel turns. But the one who knows the wheel is the axle. The axle does not turn. You are the axle. You have always been the axle.

[1551-1560]
An old practitioner once calculated the exact moment of the eon's end. He studied for years, cross-referencing texts. The day he finished his calculations, a child asked him: "What time is it now?" He could not answer. The present moment had destroyed all his mathematics.

[1561-1570]
Look. It is here. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Analysis proceeds.
 The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
