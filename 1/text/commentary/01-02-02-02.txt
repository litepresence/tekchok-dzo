Look, you think lifespan means counting birthdays? Wrong. When you drop killing like a hot
coal, something loosens immediately. Twenty years, forty, eighty thousand—it is not the
calendar that stretches but the grasping that contracts. Each non-virtue you abandon is like
taking off a tight shoe you did not know you were wearing. The body relaxes. The mind stops
holding its breath. This is the real long life, not the number on your tombstone. I used to think
more years meant more time to get enlightened. Now I see that each moment of genuine
release contains all the time you ever needed. The eighty-thousand years is a finger pointing
at timelessness. When they say abandoning wrong view brings twenty thousand years, they
mean your mind stops racing in circles. That is the long life. Not more years of confusion.
More years of clarity, which feels like eternity compressed into an instant.

Eighteen intermediate eons. You want to calculate this? I once tried to count the grains of
sand in my begging bowl. Gave up by noon. The increase and decrease happens right here—
virtue rising like bread dough, then falling flat when you forget what matters. Merit is not a
bank account. It is the absence of obstruction. When that light shines, Buddha appears.
When it dims, you get philosophers arguing about existence. Same world, different eyes.
One moment the mind is clear as a mountain stream, next it is murky with desire. That is your
intermediate eon right there. Eighteen of them in a single afternoon if you pay attention.
The increase is not accumulation. It is subtraction. You increase toward clarity by decreasing
toward confusion. Simple math, but everyone gets it backward.

[1497-1512]
Twenty eons of destruction. Sounds dramatic. But watch a thought arise and pass. That is
one eon. Watch a grudge dissolve. That is destruction and recreation together. The hell
realms empty first because even suffering exhausts itself when you stop feeding it. No new
births in hell—imagine that. Like a tavern finally running out of wine. The drunks wander
elsewhere or sober up. Either way, the place goes quiet. This is not punishment from outside.
It is exhaustion from inside. Suffering gets tired of itself eventually. Even pain needs a rest.
I spent years nursing grievances, thinking I was protecting something. Then one day I checked
the storage room where I kept all my resentments. Empty. Nothing there but cobwebs and
a faint smell of old vinegar.

[1501-1506]
Beings transfer between realms. You think this means after death? Look now. This morning
you were in hell—burning with anger. At lunch, hungry ghost territory—grasping at flavors.
Now? Maybe animal—reacting, not reflecting. The migration is constant. The passport stamp
is your own noticing. When you notice, the border dissolves. When you do not, you build
walls higher. I spent years thinking I would end up in some pure land later. Missed the fact
that I was checking in and out of six hotels every single day. The beings transferring are not
others. They are versions of you. The hell-being you were at breakfast catches a bus to
become the god you feel like after meditation. No ticket needed. Just attention. Just noticing
the transfer while it happens instead of reading about it in books.

[1516-1527]
Seven suns. One by one they rise, and the world dries like an old cow patty. Rivers become
cracks in mud. Mountains turn to dust. The fire reaches down to the golden ground of hell
itself. Sounds terrible? I have seen worse in my own chest—seven angers rising, burning
every kindness to ash. The outer suns are just mirrors of the inner ones. Put out the fire here,
and the whole cosmos cools. You do not need to wait for the apocalypse. Your next outburst
of irritation is apocalypse enough. Watch it carefully. See how it consumes everything in
reach. First it burns the person who cut you off in traffic. Then it chars your afternoon. Then
it starts on your sleep. Seven suns? I have hosted whole solar systems of irritation, each one
hotter than the last, each one drying up some reservoir of patience I did not know I had.

[1528-1532]
Then water. Then wind. Salt dissolving in water—have you seen this? The world becomes like
that. No edges. No ground to stand on. Finally even the wind disperses. What remains?
Not nothing. The sky that was always there, holding everything, touched by none of it. This
is not death. This is the bedroom you never left, dreaming you were traveling. I used to fear
dissolution. Now I see it is just the end of a story I was telling myself. The storyteller remains,
but the story dissolves like sugar in tea. The water comes and washes away the ashes. Then
the wind scatters the water. Then even the wind forgets what it was doing. What is left?
Ask the sky. It has been watching the whole show without blinking.

[1533-1550]
Eighty-four thousand eons. Sixty by sixty. I stopped counting decades ago. The math is for
scholars. You need to know this: the great eon is one breath. Inhale—worlds appear. Exhale—
they dissolve. The gap between breaths? That is where you actually live, though you keep
looking for real estate in the inhale and exhale. Stop counting. Start breathing. The destruction
you fear is just the exhale you have been holding back. Let it go. The world ends and begins
again every moment. Your job is not to save it or mourn it. Your job is to notice which moment
you are in right now. Are you building or burning? Arising or dissolving? The answer changes
with each heartbeat. Pay attention. That is the only calculation that matters.
