You think this means ancient history? No! When you abandon killing in this very moment, when you release attachment NOW, your life extends immediately—not in years measured by clocks, but in the timeless expanse of awareness that is beyond birth and death.

—this is not something that happens only at the end of the eon. When you release your grasping right now, when you stop holding onto this solid "I," the world dissolves immediately. Not into nothingness, but into its true nature that was always present.

Longchenpa speaks of eighty-thousand years increasing again through abandoning the ten non-virtues
