Third, that state momentary consciousness held. Fourth, self-appearance realizing, truth's power obtained. Fifth, primordially pure liberation. Liberated, not dissolved's gap there, emanation divides. Emanation days samadhi's days one. Five instants and samadhi's days each joined, appearance's liberation manner shown. From Self-Arising: Some five lights expanse liberated. Some five bodies expanse liberated. Some five bindus liberated. Some mirror expanse liberated. Some garland expanse liberated. Some upper-lower bindus liberated. Some garland empty liberated. That is medium's liberation manner. That too thus: Medium certainty establishing, seven days certainty obtained. That too five days bindu appearance abiding. One day dharmadhatu abiding. One day mirror pristine awareness abiding. That too own heart from body one arisen. From that bodies countless radiating. That own consciousness awakening, power becoming, again shooting star-like. Emanation also twenty-six days capable of benefit. Emaho! The five instants of liberation! Recognition can be that fast—if you're prepared. Don't think you need days or weeks—an instant of pure recognition is enough. The "emanation" that follows is natural compassion, not a return to confusion!
