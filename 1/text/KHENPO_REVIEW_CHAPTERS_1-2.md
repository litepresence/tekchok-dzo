## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### FILE REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CORRECTION:

**01-01-01-01 (Chapter 1, Section 1)**
**Status:** ❌ FAIL - Must be rewritten

**Issues Identified:**

1. **VIOLATION: Imperative Language (Major)**
   - ❌ "Look here, you who seek liberation!"
   - ❌ "Listen carefully!"
   - ❌ "Don't skim over it"
   - ❌ "Stop reading and look"
   - ❌ "You must understand"
   - ❌ "pay close attention here"
   - ❌ "Don't get lost"
   - ❌ "You should make the same request"
   - ❌ "This is crucial!"
   - ❌ "Here's what you must understand"

2. **VIOLATION: Preaching Tone**
   - Addresses reader as "my friends" (7+ times)
   - "you who seek liberation" - formal/preachy
   - Direct commands instead of experiential sharing
   - Teacher-student hierarchy instead of peer-to-peer

3. **VIOLATION: Didactic vs. Experiential**
   - Speaks AT the reader instead of FROM experience
   - Explains doctrine instead of describing recognition
   - Generic spiritual language: "This IS the teaching"
   - Binary framing throughout

**Example of Wrong Voice:**
```
"Look here, you who seek liberation! Before Longchenpa utters a single 
word of teaching, he first bows to the source of all—Samantabhadra. This 
is not mere politeness, like tipping your hat to a stranger. This is 
recognition that whatever you will read in these pages..."
```

**Should Be:**
```
"Some hermit in a yak hair tent once spent three days trying to count 
these stacked fields on his frozen fingers. Lost track somewhere around 
the eleventh and fell asleep with his butter lamp sputtering..."
```
