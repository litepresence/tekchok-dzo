First: Awareness Entering Light
**Analysis:** This passage presents the first (*dang po*) of four stages of awareness entering light (*rig pa 'od la 'jug pa*), describing the dissolution of appearances into the heart center. The structure presents a fourfold process: (1) preliminary practice—looking outward at self-appearance (*rang snang la phar lta*); (2) method—resting in knowing appearances as self-appearance (*rang snang du shes pa'i ngang la bzhag*); (3) result—appearances dissolve into the heart center (*snying gar thim pa*); (4) recognition—obtaining the ground in primordial purity (*ka dag gi rang sa zin*). The explanation then clarifies the relationship between awareness and light.

**Analysis:** Line 13695: *dang po rig pa 'od la 'jug pa rang snang la phar lta dus snang ba de rang snang du shes pa'i ngang la bzhag pas*—"First, when awareness enters the light by looking outward at self-appearance, resting in the state of knowing appearances as self-appearance." The construction *phar lta* (looking outward) contrasts with *thur lta* (looking inward). The phrase *ngang la bzhag* (resting in the state) is the technical term for non-dual placement.

Line 13696: *snang ba de dag zer thag las rang gi snying gar thim pa na 'od rig pa la 'jug pa zhes bya ste*—"When those appearances dissolve like light rays into one's own heart center, this is called entering awareness into light." The simile *zer thag* (like light rays) indicates natural dissolution rather than forced elimination.

Line 13697: *rang ngo ka dag gi rang sa ngos shes par byas pas de nyid du sa zin nas zang thal bas*—"Through recognizing one's own face as the self-place of primordial purity, ground is obtained in that very state and directly penetrated." The term *zang thal* (direct penetration) indicates unobstructed realization.

Lines 13698-13700 provide explanatory analysis of the relationship between awareness and light.

[13695-13700] <context>
**Analysis:** This passage belongs to Chapter 23 (*'bras bu*—Fruition), presenting the four stages of light dissolution that characterize the completion of Dzogchen practice. The progression from "awareness entering light" to final liberation represents the *'pho ba chen po* (great transference) or *sgyu lus rdzogs pa* (completion of illusory body). The "heart center" (*snying ga*) refers to the *chos sku'i dkyil 'khor* (dharmakāya cakra) at the heart, not the physical organ. This practice differs from lower tantra's *'pho ba* (consciousness transference) which involves ejecting consciousness through the crown aperture—here appearances themselves dissolve into the ground of awareness. The "no appearances thereafter" (*de phan chad kyi snang ba gang yang med*) indicates the vision of dharmatā's exhaustion (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba*), the third of the four visions.

[13695-13700] <concept>
**Analysis:** This passage describes the advanced Dzogchen practice where the duality of perceiver and perceived collapses. "Awareness entering light" (*rig pa 'od la 'jug pa*) means that awareness, which previously projected outward as dualistic perception, turns back (*ldog pa*) to recognize its own nature. The "self-appearance" (*rang snang*) is crucial—all appearances are awareness's own display (*rang rtsal*), not external objects. When this is recognized, appearances naturally dissolve (*thim pa*) not into nothingness but into the heart center—the space of dharmakāya (*chos sku'i dbyings*). The "direct penetration" (*zang thal*) indicates that at this stage, there is no gradual path—recognition is liberation (*ngos 'dzin sangs rgyas*). The statement that "awareness is one's own nature while light shines upon outer self-appearances" clarifies that light (*'od*) is not separate from awareness but its dynamic display (*rtsal*)—the two are non-dual (*gnyis su med pa*).
