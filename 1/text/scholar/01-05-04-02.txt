Technical Terminology Analysis

**Key Terms:**
- *byin rlabs* (blessing): Adhipatipratyaya, the empowering condition
- *dbyings* (expanse): Dharmadhatu, the all-pervasive field
- *pho brang* (palace): The spatial container of manifestation
- *rtag pa rgyun gyi 'khor mo*: The "wheel of permanent continuity," indicating the timeless nature of kayas

**Phonetic Analysis:**
The term *mdzod* (treasury) in the title indicates a comprehensive compilation, while *theg mchog* (supreme vehicle) distinguishes this as atiyoga/anuyoga material. The enumeration of realms (*'gro drug*, six realms) follows standard Abhidharma classification but reframed through tantric cosmology.

**Citation Structure:**
The passage quotes from *Thal 'gyur* (likely *Kun byed rgyal po'i thal 'gyur* or similar Nyingma tantra), establishing scriptural authority for the soteriological efficacy of mere contact with the teaching.
