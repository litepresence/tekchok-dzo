Places, Times, and Auspicious Connections

**Empowerment Locations:**
Four categories based on empowerment type:
1. **With elaboration** (*spras bcas*): Directions based on student's element
   - Earth: south-facing, protected north
   - Water: east-facing, protected west  
   - Fire: west-facing, protected east
   - Wind: north-facing, protected south

2. **Without elaboration** (*spras med*): Dense forest interiors matching student's element shapes and signs

3. **Greatly without elaboration** (*shin tu spras med*): Confluence of three valleys at mountain peak ridge

4. **Utterly without elaboration** (*rab tu spras med*): Complete solitude (*rab tu dben pa*), hermitage one *rgyang grags* (distance of arrow-flight sound) from village

**General Requirements:**
All locations should have:
- Fierce creatures (*gcang gzan ma rungs pa*)
- Poisonous snakes (*sbrul gdug pa*)
- Charnel grounds (*dur khrod*)
- Violent ḍākinīs (*mkha' 'gro ma rab tu mi bsrung*)

Quoting *Rdzogs pa rang byung*:

- South low like north
- Self's perceptual direction east
- No holes or sand
- No forms before

Maṇḍala Configuration Framework

1. **Vase empowerment** (*bum dbang*)
2. **Secret empowerment** (*gsang dbang*)
3. **Wisdom-gnosis empowerment** (*shes rab ye shes*)
4. **Word empowerment** (*tshig dbang*)

3. **Result pure nature maṇḍala** (*'bras bu rnam dag rang bzhin gyi dkyil 'khor*)

From *Rang shar*:
"Maṇḍala considered three kinds
Nature maṇḍala great
Root maṇḍala great
Reflection maṇḍala three shown"

[7688-7711] <concept>
First Maṇḍala: Root/Base

**Base/Root Maṇḍala:**
Self-arisen wisdom dwelling in all beings—light-clear maṇḍala dwelling threefold.

From *De nyid*:
"Great root maṇḍala
Each self citta's maṇḍala within dwells
That also maṇḍala thus
Self-arisen awareness maṇḍala
Five lights' appearance retinue considered
Great root maṇḍala one
Each self conch house white within
Pure thigle maṇḍala
Thigle particles light possessing retinue manner
Great root maṇḍala two
Pure emptiness' expanse maṇḍala within
Vajra interwoven body
Field's lamp retinue considered
Great root maṇḍala three

Thus maṇḍalas
Body's maṇḍala unchanging expanse
Speech's maṇḍala uninterrupted vast
Mind's maṇḍala thoughtless clear
Body speech mind's maṇḍala
Each self maṇḍala and retinue with
Not going, not coming, not changing
Each self citta's maṇḍala within dwells
Thus great maṇḍala meaning
Each self body complete"

**Reflection Maṇḍala:**
