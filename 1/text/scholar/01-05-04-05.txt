# Completion of the Six Protector-Configurations
**Analysis:** This passage completes the sextuple (*drug pa*) enumeration of protector-configurations within the difficult points chapter. The phrase *'od zer stong gi mu khyud mgon* specifies the sixth as the "rim-protector of the thousand light-rays"—a solar radiance configuration contrasting with the fifth's web/net structure. The genitive chain (*'od zer stong gi* → *mu khyud mgon*) demonstrates the hierarchical attributive structure: light-rays → thousand (genitive) → rim → protector. This establishes the progression from spatial (web) to luminous (radiance) protector typologies.

[6423] <philology>
**Analysis:** The compound *'od zer stong gi mu khyud mgon* employs multiple genitive layers: (1) *'od zer* (light-ray) as the base substantive; (2) *stong* (thousand) as numerical modifier in genitive (*gi*); (3) *mu khyud* (rim/edge/circle) as locative container; (4) *mgon* (protector) as the qualified substantive. The particle *dang* (and) following *mgon* indicates continuation beyond the enumeration, suggesting further elaboration or application of these six configurations. This construction exemplifies the heavily genitive-dependent nature of Tibetan philosophical terminology.

[6423] <context>
**Analysis:** The six protector-configurations (*mgon po drug*) represent specific maṇḍala arrangements within the *gsang sngags* (secret mantra) tradition. The progression from web-protector (*dr ba mgon*, fifth) to light-ray rim-protector (*'od zer mu khyud mgon*, sixth) suggests a movement from spatial/geometric protection (net) to temporal/illuminating protection (radiance). This enumeration serves within Longchenpa's discussion of difficult points (*dka' gnas*) in tantric practice, specifically addressing protective configurations that prevent obstacles (*bgegs*) and establish boundary protection (*mtshams bcad*) during generation and completion stage practices.

[6423] <concept>
**Analysis:** The six-protector framework extends the five-Buddha model by adding a sixth configuration emphasizing active radiance (*'od zer*) and boundary-protection (*mu khyud*). The "thousand light-rays" (*'od zer stong*) refers to the manifestation of countless emanations (*sphrul pa*) radiating in all directions, establishing protection through pervasive illumination rather than containment. This represents the *phrin las* (enlightened activity) dimension of protection—active, radiating, and expansive—contrasted with the more static web-configuration. The completion of this enumeration establishes the full protective maṇḍala framework necessary for advanced tantric practice.
