# The Sixth Protector-Configuration: Radiant Rim Protector
**Architectural Context:** This passage occupies the sixth position within the sextuple (*drug pa*) enumeration of protector-configurations (*mgon po drug*) within the difficult points (*dka' gnas*) chapter. The enumeration proceeds as a systematic catalog of protective maṇḍala arrangements essential for tantric practice. The phrase *'od zer stong gi mu khyud mgon* specifies the sixth as the "rim-protector of the thousand light-rays"—a solar radiance configuration representing the culmination of protective typologies. The genitive chain (*'od zer stong gi* → *mu khyud mgon*) demonstrates the hierarchical attributive structure characteristic of Tibetan philosophical compounds: light-rays (འོད་ཟེར་) → thousand (སྟོང་, genitive གི་) → rim/edge (མུ་ཁྱུད་) → protector (མགོན་). This structural position as the sixth and final entry suggests completion and culmination of the protective framework.

**Enumeration Logic:** The progression from spatial/geometric protection (the fifth's web/net structure དྲུག་པ་ལ་སྡེ་ཁུལ་མགོན་) to luminous/temporal protection (the sixth's radiance configuration) represents a systematic unfolding from containment to illumination. This sixth position completes the sextuple schema, establishing the full protective maṇḍala framework necessary for advanced tantric practice.

**Particle Analysis:** The dative-locative particle ལ་ (la) marks དྲུག་པ་ (drug pa, "sixth") as establishing the enumerative position within a structured list. The genitive particle གི་ (gi) appears twice: first connecting སྟོང་ (stong, "thousand") to འོད་ཟེར་ ('od zer, "light-ray"), creating the compound འོད་ཟེར་སྟོང་གི་ ("of the thousand light-rays"); second connecting this compound to མུ་ཁྱུད་ (mu khyud, "rim/circle"). The conjunction དང༌ (dang, "and") following མགོན་ (mgon, "protector") indicates continuation beyond the enumeration, suggesting these six configurations are followed by additional applications or elaborations.

**Terminology Semantic Field:** 
- འོད་ཟེར་ ('od zer): "light-ray, radiance, luminous emanation"—semantically broader than simple "light," carrying connotations of Buddha-nature's luminous awareness (*od*) and emanatory capacity
- མུ་ཁྱུད་ (mu khyud): "rim, edge, circle, circumference"—technical term for maṇḍala boundary or encircling protection
- མགོན་ (mgon): "protector, guardian"—specifically protector of the teachings (chos kyi mgon) and practitioners from obstacles

**Compound Structure:** The quadripartite compound འོད་ཟེར་སྟོང་གི་མུ་ཁྱུད་མགོན་ exemplifies the nested genitive construction typical of Tibetan philosophical terminology, where each element modifies what follows.

**Doxographical Placement:** The six protector-configurations (*mgon po drug*) represent specific maṇḍala arrangements within the *gsang sngags* (secret mantra/vajrayana) tradition. This enumeration appears within Longchenpa's treatment of difficult points (*dka' gnas*) in tantric practice, specifically addressing protective configurations that prevent obstacles (*bgegs*) and establish boundary protection (*mtshams bcad*) during generation stage (*bskyed rim*) and completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices.

**Vehicle Classification:** Within the *anuttarayogatantra* classification, protector-configurations belong to the *kriyā* (activity) and *caryā* (conduct) divisions concerned with external ritual and protective measures. The transition from web-protector (དྲུག་པ་ལ་སྡེ་ཁུལ་མགོན་, representing containment/envelopment) to light-ray rim-protector (representing illumination/radiance) reflects the progression from *kriyā* to *caryā* to *yogā* levels of subtlety.

**Enumeration Significance:** The sextuple schema extends the classical five-Buddha model (five *jina* protectors) by adding a sixth configuration emphasizing active radiance and boundary-protection. This sixfold pattern appears in various tantric contexts (six Lokapālas, six types of *phrin las* activity), reflecting the completeness of protection through six aspects.

[6423] <concept>
**Philosophical Framework:** The six-protector framework extends the five-Buddha model by adding a sixth configuration emphasizing active radiance (*'od zer*) and boundary-protection (*mu khyud*). The "thousand light-rays" (*'od zer stong*) refers to the manifestation of countless emanations (*sphrul pa*) radiating in all directions, establishing protection through pervasive illumination rather than mere containment. This represents the *phrin las* (enlightened activity) dimension of protection—active, radiating, and expansive—contrasted with the more static web-configuration representing spatial containment.

**Illumination vs. Containment:** The distinction between the fifth (web/net) and sixth (radiance) protectors reflects the fundamental tantric tension between *śūnyatā* (emptiness) as containing ground vs. *mahākaruṇā* (great compassion) as radiating emanation. The web-protector represents the wisdom aspect (emptiness as boundary), while the radiance-protector represents the method aspect (compassion as radiating activity).

**Maṇḍala Function:** This sixth protector configuration establishes the culminating protective maṇḍala framework combining both containment (rim/boundary) and radiance (illumination/emanation), necessary for advanced tantric practice where the practitioner generates the maṇḍala as both spatial enclosure and luminous emanation. The completion of this sextuple enumeration establishes the full protective apparatus for obstacle prevention and sacred space establishment.
