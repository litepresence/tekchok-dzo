Integration of Method and Wisdom

The final section presents the integration of:
- Lus (body) with sku (kaya) through union
- Ngag (speech) with gsung (vajra speech) through mantra
- Sems (mind) with thugs (vajra mind) through wind control

This three-fold integration culminates in the recognition of the co-emergent bliss (lhan cig skyes pa'i bde ba) as the nature of mind.

Completion of Empowerment and Invisibility Methods

This section presents the completion of third empowerment (dbang gsum pa) difficulties and methods for rendering the consort invisible (mi mthong ba) through ritual substances (rdzas) and dependent connection (rten 'brel). The structure moves from empowerment completion to advanced practices, establishing the boundaries of proper conduct.

Empowerment Completion and Invisibility Terms

The text employs protective vocabulary:
- "Rtogs dka' ba'i gnas" (difficult-to-realize points): Obscure teachings
- "Shin tu gsang ba" (extremely secret): Highest classification
- "Mi mthong ba" (not seeing): Invisibility
- "Rten 'brel" (dependent connection): Ritual causality
- "Ril bu" (pill): Substance preparation

The particle "ni" marks completion: "de dag gis dbang gsum pa'i rtogs dka' ba'i gnas bshad pa" (by these, the difficult-to-realize points of third empowerment are explained). The emphatic "ste" marks elaboration.
