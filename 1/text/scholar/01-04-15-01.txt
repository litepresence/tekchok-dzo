# The Four Expanses: Black, Variegated, White
**Analysis:** This passage presents the four expanses (*klong bzhi*) classification within the Expanse Section (ཀློང་སྡེ་, *klong sde*). The structure follows: (1) Black Expanse (ཀློང་ནག་, *klong nag*)—three divisions: Activity (ལས་, *las*), Compassion (སྙམ་དུ་, *snyam du*), Emanation (སྤྲུལ་པ་, *sprul pa*); (2) Variegated Expanse (ཀློང་ཁྲ་བོ་, *klong khra bo*)—three positions: existence, non-existence, both; (3) White Expanse (ཀློང་དཀར་པོ་, *klong dkar po*)—action-vast and view-meditation. The enumeration marker *dang po* (first), *gnyis pa* (second), *gsum pa* (third) establishes the progressive presentation typical of tantric classification.

[3721-3730] <philology>
**Particle Analysis:**
- *dang po* (first): ordinal establishing enumeration position
- *yin* (is): copular verb establishing identity
- *rgyu med* (causeless): negative compound indicating unconditioned nature
- *ris med* (borderless): negative compound indicating unlimited expanse
- *yin min* (is/not): correlative establishing extreme transcendence
- *phyogs gtad* (aspect/extremes): positional term for conceptual limits

**Technical Terminology:**
- *klong nag* (black expanse): the ultimate ground/dimension
- *klong khra bo* (variegated expanse): manifested diversity
- *klong dkar po* (white expanse): luminous clarity
- *ye dag* (primordially purified): adverbial indicating original purity
- *rang bzhin* (nature): intrinsic characteristic
- *lhan cig skyes pa* (co-emergent): simultaneous arising

Black Expanse: Activity and Compassion
**Analysis:** Lines 3721-3730 present first two black expanse divisions:

**Activity Expanse

[3721-3724]
:**
- Various arising causelessly
- Appearances without border (*ris med*)
- Arising-place empty, appearance-place liberated
- Samsara-nirvana nameless
- Neither existence nor non-existence aspect-reasoning
- Establishes Great Perfection view beyond extremes

**Compassion Expanse

[3725-3730]
:**
- Arising is wisdom, knowledge not depending on other
- Liberation is mind, reversing in cause-conditions
- Arising-liberation non-dually abiding
- Result primordially liberated
- Harmonious-appearance self-pure reasoning
- Great Perfection liberated at appearance-place

[3731-3740] <concept>
Black Expanse: Emanation
**Analysis:** Lines 3731-3740 would continue with the third black expanse division (emanation), followed by the other three main expanse sections (variegated, white, vast).

**Emanation Expanse:**
- Emanations of wisdom display
- Not established as samsaric existence
- Self-arisen, self-liberated

[3731-3735] <concept>
Emanation Expanse: Beyond Existence-Non-existence
**Analysis:** Lines 3731-3735 complete the third Black Expanse division (emanation):

**Core View

[3731-3734]
:**
- Free from existence-non-existence aspect assignment (*yin min phyogs gtad dang bral*)
- Nature without dependent reference (*rang bzhin gyi ltos pa med*)
- Causeless primordial purity (*rgyu med ye dag*)
- Without dependent fabrication
- Primordially liberated, aspect-spread
- Great wisdom of self-pure abiding
- Dependent basis self-exhausted

**Line 3735:**
- Called: Reasoning reversing in confused mind
- Imputed self-liberated in own place

[3736-3749] <concept>
Variegated Expanse: Three Subdivisions
**Analysis:** Lines 3736-3749 introduce the Variegated (*khra bo*) Expanse:

**Essence

[3736-3739]
:**
- Variegated existence (*yin sna tshogs*)
- Non-existence aspectless, universally self-arisen
- Play without negation-affirmation

**Three Divisions

[3740-3743]
:**
1. *yod par smra ba sems sde dang mthun pa* — Asserting existence, agreeing with Mind Section
2. *med par smra ba rang gnad dang mthun pa* — Asserting non-existence, agreeing with own crucial point
3. *yod med man ngag dang mthun par smra ba* — Asserting existence-non-existence, agreeing with Instruction

**First: Existence-Asserting

[3741-3750] <context>
Expanse Section: Scriptural Corpus
**Analysis:** Lines 3741-3750 would enumerate the scriptures of the Expanse Section:
- Various tantras and instructions
- Classified by the four main divisions
- Extensive literature comparable to Mind Section

[3744-3749]
:**
- Essence: Self-pure abiding-liberation, nowhere divided
- Nature not established as negation-affirmation
- Beyond convention, action-effort
- Non-dual characteristics
- Not transcending one mind's wheel
- Unceasing play
- Called: Appearance-mind non-dually liberated

[3750-3761] <concept>
Second and Third Variegated Divisions

**Characteristics:**

- Most direct path to realization

[3754-3761]
:**
- Essence: Empty primordially pure
