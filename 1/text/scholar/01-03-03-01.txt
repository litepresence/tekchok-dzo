The Faculties (*dbang po*)
**Analysis:**

**Etymology:** *yul 'dzin pa las dbang byed pas na dbang po* — "they are called faculties because they have power over grasping objects."

**Two-fold Classification:**

1. **Form Faculties (*gzugs can dang po'i cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of form-possessing:
   - Five sense faculties (*mig gi dbang po*, etc.)
   - Mind faculty (*yid kyi dbang po*)

2. **Wisdom Faculties (*shes rab kyi cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of wisdom:
   - Faith (*dad pa*)
   - Effort (*brtson 'grus*)
   - Mindfulness (*dran pa*)
   - Concentration (*ting nge 'dzin*)
   - Wisdom (*shes rab*)
   - Mental peace (*yid bde*)

This division maps onto the standard five (*pancha-indriya*) plus one (*yid bde*) from the Abhidharma-samuccaya tradition.

[1740-1756] <philology>
The Elemental and Wisdom Faculties
**Analysis:**

**The Six Form Faculties and Their Elements:**

1. **Eye Faculty** (*mig gi dbang po*) — holding the coarse earth portion (*sa'i cha*)
2. **Ear Faculty** (*rna ba'i dbang po*) — holding the moving wind portion (*rlung gi cha*)
3. **Nose Faculty** (*sna'i dbang po*) — holding the gathering water portion (*chu'i cha*)
4. **Tongue Faculty** (*lce'i dbang po*) — holding the ripening fire portion (*me'i cha*)
5. **Mind Faculty** (*yid kyi dbang po*) — holding the pervading space portion (*nam mkha'i cha*)
6. **Body Faculty** (*lus kyi dbang po*) — holding the gathering of various portions

This elemental correspondence reflects the standard Ayurvedic-Buddhist physiognomy, where each sense faculty is composed predominantly of one element.

**The Six Wisdom Faculties:**

1. **Faith** (*dad pa'i dbang po*) — *yongs su gdung bar byed pa* — completely afflicting the mind (in the sense of transforming/transforming)
2. **Effort** (*brtson 'grus kyi dbang po*) — *sems rno bar byed pa* — sharpening the mind
3. **Mindfulness** (*dran pa'i dbang po*) — *tshig don gyi cha ma 'chad par 'dzin pa* — holding word and meaning without interruption
4. **Concentration** (*ting nge 'dzin gyi dbang po*) — *chos nyid stong pa nyid mngon du byed cing 'jug par byed pa* — manifesting emptiness of dharmata and producing engagement
5. **Wisdom** (*shes rab kyi dbang po*) — *lta ba'i don la 'jug pa* — engaging the meaning of view
6. **Mental Peace** (*yid bde ba'i dbang po*) — *rtog pa med pa'i don sgrub pa* — producing non-conceptual meaning

[1757-1781] <structure>
Objects and Non-Objects
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents the fifth category: *yul dang yul can gyi rnam pa* (aspects of objects and possessors of objects).

**The Twofold Division of Objects:**

1. **Object of Entities** (*dngos po'i yul*):
   - Form, sound, smell, taste, dharma
   - Appearance of touch
   - Appearance of four great elements
   - Various appearances of entering conditions

2. **Object of Emptiness** (*stong pa'i yul*):
   - All emptiness, free from cognition of extreme grasping

**The Twofold Division of Non-Objects:**

1. **Transcending Extremes** (*mtha' las 'das pa*):
   - Not grasping any entity as self
   
2. **Beyond View** (*lta ba las 'das pa*):
   - The inexpressible (*brjod du med pa*)

**Key Insight:** The text distinguishes between:
- Objects that appear (*snang ba*)
- Objects that are empty (*stong pa*)
- What transcends both objectification and its negation

This tripartite structure prefigures the prasangika distinction between conventional and ultimate truths, with the addition of the "beyond extremes" (*mtha' las 'das pa*) category that characterizes Dzogchen's unique ontological position.

[1782-1810] <context>
The Uttaratantra Citation
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa cites the *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttaratantra/Ratnagotravibhaga), the seminal treatise on buddha-nature attributed to Maitreya via Asanga. This citation provides the metaphysical grounding for the entire presentation.

**The Elemental Dependent Origination:**

```
Earth is in water and wind
Wind abides excellently in space
Space is not in wind, water,
Nor in the earth element
```

**Hermeneutical Structure:**

1. **The Elements as Support:** Earth relies on water and wind
2. **The Ultimate Support:** Wind relies on space (*nam mkha'*)
3. **The Unreliance of Space:** Space does not depend on the lower elements

**Application to Buddhist Phenomenology:**

```
Aggregates, elements, and faculties
Rely upon actions and kleśas
Actions and kleśas are not correct
Yet mental activities constantly abide
```

This presents a hierarchical dependent origination (*rten 'brel*):
- Form relies on action (*las*)
- Action relies on affliction (*nyon mongs*)
- Affliction relies on incorrect mental activity (*tsul bzhin min yid byed*)
- Incorrect mental activity relies on pure mind (*sems kyi dag pa*)

**The Ultimate Point:** *sems kyi rang bzhin chos rnams ni / thams cad yang gnas ma yin* — "the phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere."

[1811-1822] <concept>
The Three Types of Action
**Analysis:**

From the previous analysis emerge three types of action (*las gsum*):

1. **Meritorious Action** (*bsod nams kyi las*):
   - Produces pleasurable results of samsara
   - Includes ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*) and merit-compatible actions
   - Result: Higher realms, human/divine happiness

2. **Non-Meritorious Action** (*bsod nams ma yin pa*):
   - Ten non-virtues (*mi dge ba bcu*)
   - Five uninterrupted offenses (*mtshams med pa lnga*)
   - Result: Lower realms, suffering

3. **Immovable Action** (*mi g.yo ba'i las*):
   - Produces results in higher realms (*khams gong ma'i sa*)
   - *gzhar du mi g.yo bar 'bras bu 'byin pa'i phyir* — produces immovable results elsewhere
   - Associated with form and formless realm meditation

**Dzogchen Critique:** All three are still *'khor ba'i las* — actions of samsara. True liberation transcends even meritorious action.

[1823] <structure> The Six Afflictions
**Analysis:**

The text introduces the six root afflictions (*nyon mongs pa drug*), which serve as the foundation for all contaminated actions. These are:

1. Desire/attachment (*'dod chags*)
2. Anger/aversion (*zhe sdang*)
3. Pride/arrogance (*nga rgyal*)
4. Ignorance (*ma rig pa* / *gti mug*)
5. Doubt (*the tshom*)
6. View (*lta ba*)

These six function as the proximate cause for the arising of action, which in turn produces the aggregates, elements, and faculties that constitute the ground of delusion.

[1824-1836] <context>
The Sun-Moon-Union Analysis of Afflictions
**Analysis:**

The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) provides the scriptural authority for the six root afflictions. Each represents confusion (*'khrul pa*) arising from a specific dimension of experience:

**The Sixfold Structure:**

1. **Ignorance** (*ma rig pa*) — confusion from grasping the basis-of-confusion conceptually (*gzhis 'khrul rtog gi cha 'dzin pa*)
2. **Delusion** (*gti mug*) — confusion from the wisdom portion (*shes rab kyi cha las 'khrul pa*)
3. **Hatred** (*zhe sdang*) — confusion from the stage of generation (*skyed pa'i rim pa'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
4. **Pride** (*nga rgyal*) — confusion from the view portion (*lta ba'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
5. **Attachment** (*'dod chags*) — confusion from the appearance portion (*snang ba'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
6. **Jealousy** (*phrag dog*) — confusion from unmanifest effects (*ma rtogs pa'i las 'khrul pa*)

**Extended Analysis:** The afflictions function as:
- The mind grasping thoughts (*bsam pa rnam rjes su 'dzin pa'i sems*)
- Memory grasping recollections (*dran pa rnam rjes su 'dzin pa'i yid*)
- Concepts becoming the basis of habitual tendencies and doubt

[1837-1841] <structure>
The 84,000 Afflictions
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents the traditional enumeration: the conceptual masses (*rtog tshogs*) generate 84,000 (*brgyad khri bzhi stong*) afflictions.

**Distribution:**
- Attachment: 21,000
- Hatred: 21,000
- Delusion: 21,000
- Equal combination of all three: 21,000

This taxonomy derives from the *Abhidharmakosa* and reflects the standard Yogacara classification of defilements.

[1842-1863] <concept>
The Rope-Snake Metaphor
**Analysis:**

The text presents the classic *thag pa sbrul 'dzin* (rope-snake grasping) metaphor from the *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl-Garland):

**The Simile Structure:**
1. A rope in dim light appears as a snake
2. The snake-appearance is "true" as appearance (*snang ba*)
3. The rope-reality is "correct" as ultimate (*don dam*)
4. Both are valid within their respective frames

**Application to Two Truths:**

```
The nature of the two truths:
Merely the conventional world
No relation to the ultimate
From the expanse of emptiness,
All aspects of that are liberated
```

**Philological Precision:**
- *de lta snang ba* — appearing thus (conventional appearance)
- *thag pa la ni sbrul mthong* — seeing snake where there is rope (conventional error)
- *de ma yin la der bzung* — grasping that which is not that (the fundamental error)

**Dzogchen Synthesis:** The aggregates are *sgyu ma sprul pa bzhin* — "like illusory emanations" — the same term used to describe the Buddha's display (*sprul pa*).

[1864] <structure> Transition to Vehicle Analysis
**Analysis:**

The text completes the presentation of samsaric phenomena (*'khor ba'i chos*) and transitions to the vehicles (*theg pa*). Knowing these confused appearances (*'khrul snang*) leads to entry into the ultimate truth (*don dam pa'i bden pa*).

[1865-1867] <context>
Chapter Transition
**Analysis:**

The text marks the completion of the second major section with a citation from the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra: *de kun 'khor ba'i rgyu 'ba' zhig lags* — "all of these are merely the causes of samsara." This establishes that the preceding analysis of aggregates, elements, sense sources, and faculties serves as the foundation for understanding cyclic existence.

[1868-1880] <structure>
Chapter III: Detailed Division of Samsaric Phenomena
**Analysis:**

The chapter heading establishes the scope: *'khor ba'i chos rab tu dbye ba ste rim khang gsum pa* — "The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter."

**Epistemological Framework:**

Longchenpa introduces the vehicle classification (*theg pa'i rnam grangs*) with authority from the *Rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud* (Great Tantra of Self-Arisen Awareness):

```
Hold the secret vajra!
My vehicle is immeasurable.
It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
Samsara and nirvana.
```

**Two-fold Division:**

1. **Worldly Vehicle** (*'jig rten pa'i theg pa*)
2. **Transcendent Vehicle** (*'jig rten las 'das pa'i theg pa*)

[1881-1897] <concept>
The Worldly Vehicle Analysis
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa applies the fivefold analysis (*lnga*) to the worldly vehicle:

**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*'khor ba las mi 'phags pa'i yid dpyod kyi rnam grangs* — "the enumerations of mental investigation that do not transcend samsara"

**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
*'jig rten gyi legs par tsam la sbyor zhing 'god pa* — "engaging and establishing merely the excellence of the world"

**3. Division (*dbye na*):**
- *sor bzhag* — Fixated vehicle
- *phyin ci log* — Mistaken vehicle

**4. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*rang rang gi 'bras bu 'grub par byed pa* — "accomplishing one's own results"

**5. Result (*'bras bu*):**
The manifestation of one's particular result at a certain time

**The Fixated Vehicle of Gods and Humans:**

Longchenpa references the *Rdo rje sems dpa' sgyu 'phrul drwa chen po* (Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva):
*theg pa sna pa lha dang mi'i theg pa'o* — "the earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans"

This vehicle accumulates merit (*bsod nams*) through:
- Ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*)
- Ethical discipline (*gso sbyong*)
- Merit-compatible actions (*bsod nams cha mthun*)

**Technical Term:** *sor bzhag* (fixated/established separately) indicates that this vehicle establishes samsara as the basis (*rten*) without transcending it.

[1898-1901] <philology>
Transition to Mistaken Vehicles
**Analysis:**

The text transitions to *phyin ci log gi theg pa* (mistaken vehicles), citing the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen Tantra) as the authoritative source. These represent the non-Buddhist (*mu stegs*) philosophical systems that grasp at erroneous views.
