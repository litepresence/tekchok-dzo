[669-669] [STRUCTURE]
Three Kayas in the Expanse
**Analysis:** The first subsection has two parts:
1. Brief presentation of the definition of kayas (*sku'i nges brjod mdor bstan pa*)
2. Extensive explanation of the place (*gnas rgyas par bshad pa*)

The core teaching: "Though essence is one, the three kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects" (*ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad kyi tshul du sku gsum dbyings la bzhugs te*). This reflects the Madhyamaka *ekartha* (single nature) principle applied to the doctrine of multiple form-bodies.

[670-676] [CONTEXT]
Citation from Self-Arisen Tantra
**Analysis:** Longchenpa quotes *rang shar* on the three kayas as "wisdom-appearance" (*ye shes snang ba*):
- Without obstruction to anything (*gang la thogs pa med pa*)
- Perceived objects being one (*dmigs pa'i yul ni gcig pa yi*)
- Essence appearing individually (*ngo bo so sor snang ba'o*)

This presents the kayas as modalities of appearance (*snang tshul*) rather than distinct ontological entities.

[677-682] [CONTEXT]
Three Kayas as Awareness Itself
**Analysis:** A second citation (also from Self-Arisen or a related tantra) maps the trikaya onto single awareness (*rig pa gcig*):

| Aspect | Kaya | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| Without thought | Dharmakaya | *rig pa rtog med chos sku'i ngo bo* |
| Unceasing clarity | Sambhogakaya | *rig pa ma 'gags gsal ba longs sku* |
| Appearing as whatever | Nirmanakaya | *rig pa cir yang snang ba sprul sku* |

[683-684] [PHILOLOGY]
Textual Note
**Analysis:** The final lines (*'di la rdzogs pa / sangs pa*) appear to be transitional or summative, possibly indicating "In this, complete / awakened" or referencing completion of this section before transitioning to the next topic. The fragmentary nature suggests either a section break or the beginning of a new hermeneutical move.
