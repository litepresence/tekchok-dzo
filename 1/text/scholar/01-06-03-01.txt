# The Four Empowerments: Vase Empowerment Configuration
**Analysis:** This passage presents the first (*dang po*) of four empowerments (*dbang bzhi*) within the middling elaboration-with practice (*spros bcas 'bring gi rnam par gzhag pa*). The structure follows the standard progression: (1) preparatory requirements (*stagon bya ba*)—deity, vase, student; (2) ritual substances (*rten rdzas*)—eight auspicious, seven royal; (3) empowerment substance (*dbang gi rdzas*)—tsaka-li, protruding images, or statues; (4) consecration sequence—Vajra blessing, name-empowerment, command-seal poti; (5) activity completion (*phrin las*)—Glorious Torma empowerment. This establishes the *bum dbang* (vase empowerment) as the foundation for subsequent higher empowerments.

**Analysis:** The term *rdul tshon gyi dkyil 'khor* (colored-powder maṇḍala) employs the genitive *gyi* to specify the maṇḍala medium—powder rather than constructed or imagined. The phrase *stagon du bya ba* (preparation to be done) uses the auxiliary *bya ba* (to be done/made) indicating obligatory preparatory requirements. The compound *tsaka li* (Sanskrit: *cakrāvali*) refers to circular ritual diagrams or mandala plates. The verb *dbang bskur* (to confer empowerment) appears in perfective form (*bskur*) throughout, marking completed ritual actions. The honorific *dpal gyi gtor ma* (glorious torma) maintains the reverential register for sacramental offerings.

**Analysis:** These lines present the standard *dbang bzhi* (four empowerments) structure of the *spros bcas* (with elaboration) approach in Nyingma Mahāyoga. The vase empowerment (*bum dbang*) corresponds to the *bskyed rim* (generation stage), purifying birth and establishing the basis for deity yoga. The eight auspicious substances (*bkra shis rdzas brgyad*) and seven royal possessions (*rgyal srid sna bdun*) constitute the material supports (*rten*) for the empowerment. The consecration sequence—Vajra blessing (*rdo rje byin*), name-empowerment (*ming gi dbang*), command-seal (*bka' rtags phyag rgya*)—follows the *mngon par rtogs pa'i rgyan* (ornament of clear realization) structure. This entire configuration belongs to the middling (*'bring*) practice level, distinct from both extensive (*chen po*) and condensed (*bsdus pa*) approaches.

[8112-8119] <concept>
**Analysis:** The four empowerments (*dbang bzhi*) constitute the progressive initiation sequence: (1) *Bum dbang* (vase)—purifies birth, ripens for generation stage, establishes connection to maṇḍala; (2) *Gsang dbang* (secret)—purifies defilements, ripens for channels/winds, introduces bliss-emptiness; (3) *Shes rab ye shes* (prajñā-jñāna)—purifies sexual energy, ripens for wisdom-wind practices; (4) *Tshig dbang* (word)—purifies mind, ripens for Atiyoga, introduces direct recognition. The *stagon* (preparation) requirements establish proper ritual container: deity (support), vase (substance), student (recipient). The distinction between attachment (*chags can*) and non-attachment (*chags bral*) determines whether actual (*dngos*) or visualized (*dmigs pa*) practice is appropriate, reflecting the *sgom pa'i sgo mo* (meditation doorway) hermeneutical principle.

# Secret Empowerment and Prajñā-Jñāna Distinctions
**Analysis:** This section presents the second (*gsang dbang*) and third (*shes rab ye shes*) empowerments with their respective criteria. The structure employs the deictic marker *de nas* (then/thereupon) to mark progression: vase → secret → prajñā-jñāna. The twofold division for the third empowerment—non-attached through visualization (*dmigs pa*), attached through actual practice (*las kyi mu dra dngos*)—demonstrates the *rigs lam* (path of capacity) hermeneutic, wherein practitioner disposition determines method. The boundary marker *de yan chad* (up to that point) establishes the first three as causal (*rgyu mtson*) empowerments distinct from the resultant word-empowerment.

[8120-8125] <philology>
**Analysis:** The phrase *byang sems gnyis sbyin pa* (giving the two bodhicittas) employs *byang sems* (bodhicitta) in its tantric sense as white/red essences (*thig le dkar dmar*), not the sūtric aspiration. The genitive *gsang dbang* (secret empowerment) indicates the hidden/inner nature of this transmission. The conditional construction *chags bral la* / *chags can la* (for non-attached/attached) demonstrates the discriminating application (*bye brag tu sbyor ba*) principle. The term *mu dra* (Sanskrit: *mudrā*) here refers to consort practice, distinct from its meaning as hand-gesture or seal in other contexts. The phrase *ma rtogs rgyu mtson* (indicating the cause of non-realization) uses *mtshon* (to indicate/point out) in its technical hermeneutical sense—pointing to what is not yet directly known.

[8120-8125] <context>
**Analysis:** The second empowerment (*gsang dbang*) introduces the esoteric physiology of channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and essences (*thig le*), preparing the practitioner for completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices. The "two bodhicittas" refer to the white and red essences associated with the bindu-drop (*thig le*) physiology. The third empowerment's twofold structure reflects the classical Nyingma distinction between *yid byed* (mental activity) for those without attachment and *dngos gzhi* (actual basis) for those with attachment, as detailed in the *gso sbyong* (restoration) literature. The designation of these first three as "indicating the cause" (*rgyu mtson*) establishes them as preparatory to the direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) of the fourth empowerment.

[8120-8125] <concept>
**Analysis:** The progression from vase to word empowerment represents the *sbyang gsum* (three purifications) and *smin gsum* (three ripenings) framework: vase purifies birth and ripens for generation stage; secret purifies defilements and ripens for channels/winds; prajñā-jñāna purifies sexual neurosis and ripens for essences/wisdom-winds. The attachment/non-attachment distinction reflects the *bstan pa spyi'i rgyud* (general tantra of teachings) principle that method must match capacity (*dbang po*). Those without attachment can work with visualization (*dmigs pa*); those with attachment must work with actuality (*dngos*) to transform attachment into wisdom. This is the *kun nas nyon mongs shes bya'i sgrib* (afflictive and cognitive obstructions) transformation principle.

# Word Empowerment: Rigpa Transmission Structure
**Analysis:** This passage presents the fourth (*bzhi pa*) empowerment—the Word Empowerment (*tshig dbang*)—also called the Empowerment of Realization Wisdom (*rtogs pa ye shes kyi dbang*). The structure employs the threefold hermeneutic (*gsum ldan*): external (*phyi*), internal (*nang*), secret (*gsang*). External: View (*lta ba*) of the nature; Internal: Meditation (*sgom pa*) as method; Secret: Empowering Rigpa's three aspects. The introduction (*ngo sprod*) sequence follows: introducing Rigpa (*rig pa la ngo sprod*) → direct viewing (*mngon sum gyis don la lta*) → Rigpa-Potency transmission (*rig pa rtsal gyi dbang*). This establishes the *spros bcas* (with elaboration) completion and introduces the *spros med* (without elaboration) transition.

[8126-8137] <philology>
**Analysis:** The term *tshig dbang* (word empowerment) derives from *tshig* (word/speech) in the sense of direct oral transmission, not merely verbal description. The phrase *rtogs pa ye shes* combines *rtogs pa* (realization/understanding) with *ye shes* (primordial wisdom), indicating wisdom-arising-through-realization rather than intellectual understanding. The threefold division marker *gsum du phye nas* (dividing into three) introduces the hermeneutical schema. The compound *shar grol* (arise-release) refers to the spontaneous arising and self-release of thoughts—a key *rdzogs chen* technical term. The verb *sprod* (to introduce/place before) in *ngo sprod* and *ngos prod* indicates direct pointing-out instruction. The phrase *spros bcas 'bring* (middling elaboration-with) positions this within the graded practice typology.

[8126-8137] <context>
**Analysis:** The fourth empowerment corresponds to the *mtshon byed don gyi dbang* (empowerment indicating the meaning) or *rtogs pa'i dbang* (realization empowerment) in Nyingma classification. The external-internal-secret threefold structure (*phyi nang gsang gsum*) is a fundamental Nyingma hermeneutical framework: external corresponds to scripture and view; internal to meditation and experience; secret to direct recognition and Rigpa. The "three aspects of Rigpa" (*rig pa gsum*) refer to essence (*ngo bo*), nature (*rang bzhin*), and compassion (*thugs rje*), or alternatively to recognizing (*ngos shes*), introduction (*ngo sprod*), and confidence (*gtad med*). This empowerment directly introduces the *gnas lugs* (abiding nature) and establishes the practitioner for *spros med* (without elaboration) practice.

[8126-8137] <concept>
**Analysis:** The fourth empowerment represents the transition from causal to resultant vehicles (*rgyu 'bras kyi theg pa*). The first three empowerments are "causal" (*rgyu mtson*)—they prepare the ground but do not directly introduce the nature. The word empowerment is "resultant" (*'bras bu mtson*)—it directly introduces Rigpa (*rig pa ngo sprod*), the nature of mind. The threefold structure (external view, internal meditation, secret Rigpa) corresponds to the *lta sgom spyod gsum* (view, meditation, conduct) triad. The *shar grol* (arise-release) principle—pressing the essential point of arise-release (*shar grol gyi gnad la bger ba*)—is the core *rdzogs chen* instruction: whatever arises releases spontaneously without rejection or acceptance. This establishes the *ma bcos lhan cig skyes* (uncontrived coemergence) of realization.
