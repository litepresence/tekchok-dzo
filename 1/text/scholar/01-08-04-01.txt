Presentation of Variegated Appearance Position

**Analysis:** Lines 10716-10723 present the sixth position ('dod pa): the essence manifests universally (kun tu shar), therefore the manner of appearance manifests as variegated and manifold (khra bo sna tshogs). The structure follows: position identifier (drug pa la'ang khas blangs brjod pa ni), essence characterization (universal manifestation), and appearance characterization (variegated multiplicity). This position begins a refutation examining three alternatives: whether manifold appearance is external appearance (phyi snang ba), internal cognition (nang shes pa), or their aggregation (tshogs pa).

Appearance Vocabulary and Alternative Formulation

**Analysis:** The passage employs appearance terminology: khra bo (variegated/multicolored), sna tshogs (manifold/various), snang tshul (manner of appearance), and shar (manifest/arise). The term khas blangs (acceptance/assertion) at line 10716 parallels khas len. Line 10718 marks the transition to refutation with gnyis pa de dgag pa ni. The disjunctive dam (or) introduces three alternatives at lines 10719-10721. The demonstrative de (that) at line 10722 refers to the ground. The phrase sna tshogs su phyir shar ba (manifests as manifold) at line 10723 marks the consequence being analyzed. The connective la serves multiple functions marking location and logical connection.

Appearance Theory in Buddhist Epistemology

**Analysis:** This position engages with Buddhist theories of appearance (snang ba) and their relationship to cognition (shes pa). The three alternatives presented—external, internal, or aggregated—reflect classical Buddhist options for explaining the nature of appearance: (1) **External Realism:** Appearances exist objectively outside mind; (2) **Idealism:** Appearances are purely internal to cognition; (3) **Aggregation Theory:** Appearances arise from the interaction of external and internal factors. Longchenpa's analysis will demonstrate that all three options lead to problems when applied to the ground, preparing for his own presentation of appearance as the spontaneous manifestation of ground without separation from it.

Variegated Appearance and Ground Multiplicity

**Analysis:** The position posits that universal manifestation (kun tu shar) in essence necessarily produces variegated appearance (khra bo sna tshogs) in manifestation. This creates a potential problem: if appearance is truly manifold (sna tshogs), does this make the ground itself manifold? The refutation examines this by analyzing the three possible locations of manifold appearance: (1) If external, the ground itself becomes manifold (line 10723); (2) If internal, the ground becomes momentary and multiple like mind; (3) If aggregated, the ground becomes dualistic. All options violate the non-dual nature of ground. This analysis demonstrates that appearance cannot be explained as something other than ground without creating dualistic consequences.
