[14752-14752] <structure>

**Organizational Context:** This passage concludes the fourfold sequence of bardo recognition moments, representing the fourth and final stage of awareness in the intermediate state. The verse number [14752] marks this as the culmination of the preceding three moments, forming a complete progression from initial appearance through recognition to full realization.

**Structural Function:** This brief verse serves as the conclusive statement of the bardo teaching sequence, establishing the final achievement. The terse formulation reflects the Great Perfection's emphasis on pointing directly to realization through minimal textual elaboration. The content shifts from the dynamic recognition of the third moment to the static realization of the fourth moment.

**Tibetan Text Analysis:**
- བཞི་པ་ (bzhi pa): "Fourth" - ordinal numeral derived from བཞི (bzhi) with -pa nominalizing suffix; completes the four-part sequence
- ལ་ (la): dative-locative particle marking the domain or occasion
- རང་སྣང (rang snang): "self-appearance, self-manifestation" - compound crucial to rdzogs chen philosophy; རང (rang) reflexive pronoun, སྣང (snang) "appearing, manifestation"; denotes the way phenomena appear from their own nature without external cause
- དུ (du): directional-locative particle indicating manner or direction
- རྟོགས (rtogs): "realization, understanding" - verbal root meaning to comprehend, realize, or understand; differs from mere knowing (shes) by implying full apprehension
- ཏེ (te): conjunctive particle indicating result or conclusion
- བདེན་པའི (bden pa'i): "of truth, of reality" - from བདེན (bden) "true, real" with genitive འི (yi); refers to ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya)
- སྟོབས (stobs): "power, force, strength" - denotes capacity or ability
- རྙེད (nyed): "obtain, find, acquire" - verbal root indicating gaining or achieving

**Grammatical Analysis:** The structure follows a two-part construction: [Realization + ཏེ] + [Object + Power]. The verbal compound རྟོགས་ཏེ indicates the result of realization, while བདེན་པའི་སྟོབས་རྙེད indicates what enables this realization. The self-appearance (rang snang) serves as both the means and object of realization.

[14752-14752] <context>

**Philosophical Context:** This passage articulates a core Great Perfection doctrine—the self-manifesting nature of reality. Unlike other Buddhist schools that explain appearance through dependent origination (rten cing 'brel bar 'byung ba), rdzogs chen asserts that phenomena manifest from their own nature (rang snang) without external causes or conditions.

**Truth (bden pa) in rdzogs chen:** The term "truth" (bden pa) here refers not to propositional truth but to the actual nature of phenomena—the empty and luminous reality that is always present but obscured by ignorance. "Power of truth" indicates that realization arises from the force of reality itself, not from conceptual effort.

**Comparison with Other Traditions:**
- **Yogācāra**: Emphasizes consciousness-only (vijñapti-mātra)
- **Madhyamaka**: Emphasizes emptiness (śūnyatā) and dependent origination
- **rDzogs chen**: Emphasizes self-manifestation (rang snang) and the self-arising of awareness

[14752-14752] <concept>

**Self-appearance (rang snang):** This concept represents the unique rdzogs chen contribution to Buddhist philosophy. While other traditions explain appearance through the interaction of consciousness and objects, rdzogs chen teaches that appearances arise from the luminosity (gsal ba) of awareness itself. Phenomena do not appear to consciousness; rather, appearance and awareness are non-dual.

**The Power of Truth:** The phrase "power of truth" (bden pa'i stobs) indicates that liberation is not achieved through personal effort alone but through the inherent power of reality itself. When one realizes self-appearance, the force of truth accomplishes what practice cannot—this is the "spontaneous presence" (lhun grub) dimension of rdzogs chen.

** soteriological Achievement:** The fourth moment represents complete realization—not merely recognizing the nature of awareness but fully embodying that recognition such that the power of truth accomplishes liberation. This is the "attainment" (nyed) promised in the passage—the achievement of buddhahood through non-dual realization.

**Practical Significance:** For practitioners, this passage indicates that during the bardo or in meditation, realization occurs not through striving but through allowing self-appearance to manifest. The "power of truth" works when the practitioner ceases conceptual interference and allows the natural manifestation of awareness to reveal itself.

**Connection to Triyāna:** This fourth moment represents the culmination of the three vehicles (theg gsum): the śrāvaka achieves liberation from suffering, the bodhisattva achieves enlightenment for others, but the Great Perfection practitioner realizes self-appearance through the power of truth itself, representing the highest and most direct path.
