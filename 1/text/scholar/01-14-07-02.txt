# Structural Marker: Second Division of Wisdom Lamps
**Analysis:** This marker initiates the second (*gnyis pa*) division within Chapter 14, Section 7, addressing the second wisdom lamp. The phrase *'od kyi zer thag tu gnas pa* (abiding as a continuum/ray-thread of light) indicates this section treats the second lamp—likely the awareness-expanse lamp (*rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma*)—which abides as the continuous thread or stream of luminous clarity. The progression from first (field of light) to second (thread of light) suggests a movement from expansive ground to continuous medium.

**Analysis:** The ordinal *gnyis pa* (second) marks the enumeration. The phrase *'od kyi zer thag tu* employs the genitive *kyi* with *zer* (ray/beam) and *thag* (thread/continuum) to create the compound "ray-thread"—suggesting both radiance (*zer*) and continuity (*thag pa*). The terminative *tu* following *thag* indicates the manner of abiding—abiding AS or IN the manner of a thread of light. The continuative *dang* (and) suggests further elaboration will follow. This construction emphasizes the continuous, unbroken nature of this lamp compared to the field-like quality of the first.

**Analysis:** This marker corresponds to the second of the four wisdom lamps in *rDzogs chen* practice. While the first lamp (bindu-empty) appears as a field/mass of light in the heart, this second lamp—awareness-expanse lamp (*rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma*)—abides as the continuous stream or thread of awareness pervading all experience. The "ray-thread" (*zer thag*) metaphor suggests both the laser-like precision of awareness and its continuity across moments. This lamp specifically supports the recognition of *rang bzhin* (nature) as spontaneously present luminosity.

[19405] <concept>
**Analysis:** The second wisdom lamp represents the *dbyings* (expanse/dhātu) dimension of awareness—the all-pervasive, continuous ground of knowing that underlies all appearances. If the first lamp (bindu-empty) is the *thig le* (drop/essence), this second lamp is the *dbyings* (expanse) in which the drop manifests. The "thread" (*thag*) metaphor indicates the *rgyun* (continuum) of awareness—the unbroken stream of knowing that persists through waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. This lamp supports recognition of the nature (*rang bzhin*) as luminous clarity (*gsal ba*) pervading all dimensions of experience.
