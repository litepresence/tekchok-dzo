Sixth Section: Visions of Thödgal Practice
**Analysis:** This passage presents the sixth (*drug pa*) section describing the progressive stages of visionary experience (*snang ba*) in *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) practice. The structure presents a sevenfold progression: (1) initial appearance—red-yellow round (*dmar ser zlum po*); (2) development—five-light rim (*'od lnga'i mu khyud*); (3) movement—wind's crucial point (*rlung gi gnad*); (4) method—outward holding (*phyir bzung*); (5) experience—taking the clear portion (*dangs pa'i cha nyams su blangs*); (6-8) three specific visions—lamp like mirror (*sgron ma me long*), light like slice (*'od re lde*), body expanding from bindu (*thig le 'khar phor*). The passage concludes with a tantric citation marker (*de las*) introducing a verse.

[9069-9078] <philology>
**Analysis:** Line 9069: *dang po dmar ser zlum po las*—"From the first red-yellow round." The term *zlum po* (round/spherical) describes the initial bindu appearance.

Line 9070: *phyis 'od lnga'i mu khyud du snang ngo*—"Later appears as the five-light rim." The compound *mu khyud* (rim/circumference) indicates the circular manifestation of five lights.

Line 9071-9072: *de'ang rlung gi gnad kyis 'gul ba las / phyir bzung dal ba gnad do*—"Also from moving by wind's crucial point, the crucial point of holding outward slowly." The repetition of *gnad* (crucial point/key) emphasizes the importance of wind/breath control.

Line 9073-9076: The progression uses the instrumental *las* and *nas* to indicate sequential development, with the comparative *tsam* (like/similar to) introducing similes for each vision stage.

Line 9077-9078: *de las / de ltar gtems pa'i snang ba ni*—"From that: Thus pressing appearance." The citation formula marks tantric source material.

[9069-9078] <context>
**Analysis:** This passage belongs to Chapter 20's presentation of the four visions (*snang ba bzhi*) in *thod rgal* practice, specifically describing the detailed phenomenology of the second vision—*nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba* (vision of increasing experience). The descriptions of colored lights, bindus (*thig le*), and expanding forms are characteristic of *thod rgal* physiology—the external manifestation of internal energetic transformations. The five lights (*'od lnga*) correspond to the five elements purified: white (space), green (wind), red (fire), blue (water), yellow (earth). The progression from bindu to expanded forms reflects the dissolving of material perception into energetic/luminous perception. The "wind's crucial point" (*rlung gi gnad*) refers to specific prāṇāyāma techniques that activate the *rlung* (vital winds) to support visionary experience.

**Analysis:** This passage describes the *sgron ma gsum* (three lamps) and *thod rgal gyi snang ba* (visions of direct transcendence) that constitute the Dzogchen completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practice. The progressive visions reveal awareness's (*rig pa*) natural luminosity (*rang gsal*) as the true nature of perception. The initial red-yellow bindu represents the *kun gzhi* (ālaya) consciousness beginning to transform; the five-light rim represents the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) emerging from the five afflictions (*nyon mongs lnga*). The three specific visions—lamp like mirror (*me long sgron ma*), light like slice (*'od re lde*), and body from bindu (*thig le las sku*)—demonstrate increasingly subtle perception: first appearances become like reflections (empty yet apparent), then like stacked slices (multi-dimensional emptiness), finally revealing that form itself is bindu/light. This is not hallucination but the natural purification of perception when awareness recognizes itself.
