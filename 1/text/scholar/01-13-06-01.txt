Essence of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The essence is all lamps' object-knower, intent dharmata empty-luminous self-abiding, knowing with power. Through method-distance water lamp, bindu, sphere three unmoving gazing: inside self-awareness clarity-emptiness half-pure self-abiding, expanse rolling knowing with awareness.

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17079-17087) establishes:
- Self-arising wisdom lamp thus
- All lamps' object-knower abiding
- All's parts this itself
- Discriminating wisdom itself
- Abiding without discriminating manner
- Subtle part arising essence
- Primordially thus abiding

---

**Summary:** Page 404 completes the third lamp with the actual lamp description and na-ro simile, then inaugurates the fourth lamp with its essence definition. The progression moves from spatial-expansive sphere to self-recognized wisdom as the culmination of the four-lamp system.

Etymological analysis of *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*:
- *shes rab* (wisdom/prajñā): From *nang du rang gnas lhun grub kyi dgongs pa shes dus* (when knowing the self-abiding spontaneous intent within)
- *rang byung* (self-arising): Not found by seeking, obtained from self; arising without cessation; wisdom knows dharmas clearly
- *rab* (supreme): Intent difficult to realize by others, obtained from self without searching, supreme peak
- *rang* (self): Jewel existing primordially in self found
- *byung* (arisen): Self-arisen without cessation
- *sgron ma* (lamp): Dharmas clearly known
- *ma* (mother/suffix): Self-appearance self-face known, pervading knowing

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17098-17115) provides extensive analysis:
- Knowing entity and non-entity
- All appearance greatly entered
- General meaning knowing
- Unsought placed confidence obtained
- Self ye shes measures known
- Nature pure dharmakaya
- Unobtained by three, self-known
- Superior appearing greatly
- Others' analysis place nonexistent
- Self-arisen primordially pure object
- Not others' object, called self
- Without doing, this meaning not obtained
- Without hope for anyone
- Primordially self-arisen called arisen
- Lamp dharmata all
- Nondual appearance makes
- Ma: self-face pervading knowing

[17116-17122] <context>
Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
"Example like butter-lamp / Knowing all dharmas instantaneously / Supreme becomes all's peak / Self other-dependency dharma free / Arisen unblocked freely appears."

This establishes the butter-lamp (*sgron me*) simile for wisdom's illuminating function.

[17123-17157] <concept>
Fivefold classification (*dbye ba*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
1. *gzhi gnas rang byung gi shes rab* (Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom): Rigpa's knowing aspect, arising basis and support
2. *snang ba cer 'dzin gyi shes rab* (Appearance-directly-holding wisdom): Sphere-awareness nondual union, self-time self-clear, stainless purity, intent delivers to dharmata
3. *dran pa 'gag med kyi shes rab* (Memory-unceasing wisdom): Arising marks none, yet arising, liberated self-face dharmata unified gathering
4. *so sor rtog pa'i shes rab* (Individually-discriminating wisdom): Dharma and dharma-possessor, self and general marks, characteristics, etc., unmixed appearance knowing
5. *'jug byed rnam gsum gyi shes rab* (Three-entrance wisdom): In natural bardo, hearing establishes, thinking decides, meditation tastes experience, definitely extracts from samsara, word-meaning realized

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17140-17157) authenticates:
- Classification fivefold
- Ground-abiding self-arising wisdom makes body etc. dharmas' supports
- Appearance-holding wisdom holds sphere-awareness union
- Unceasing memory wisdom gathers one-pointed knowing objects
- Individually-discriminating wisdom discriminates general and self marks
- Three-entrance wisdom establishes in natural bardo

[17158-17163] <context>
Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*):
The characteristic is knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by object-awareness rigpa as natureless.

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17156-17159) and *sdud pa* (17160-17163):
- Appearing and non-appearing all dharmas / natureless who knows / this is that characteristic
- Dharmas natureless transformed / this called prajñāpāramitā supreme

[17164-17178] <concept>
Door of arising (*'char byed kyi sgo*):
The five faculties (*dbang po lnga*) are the door because sense-faculties measure objects as wisdom, that being the door.

Particularly, nose memory wisdom wind (*shes rab kyi rta me rlung*) moving is that itself. Fire-wind wisdom's resound like fire sparks, night-time yawn occurring, arises thus known.

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17169-17178):
- Arising door five faculties
- Particularly from nose arises
- That sign night time
- Yawn and fierce yawn
- Very fierce yawn body time
- Red resounding light rays
- Like fire sparks spreading
- That measure and sign
- Arising door recognized

---

**Summary:** Page 405 provides the definition, fivefold classification, characteristic, and door of the fourth lamp. The analysis reveals self-arising wisdom as the self-recognized knowing that integrates all prior lamps through nondual sphere-awareness union.

[17179-17213] <concept>
Abode (*gnas*) of Self-Arising Wisdom:
The abode is cit's four great channels' root, rigpa's self-resound wind held, not outer-projected, inner self-abiding mere unclear, from action wind outer power moved, objects rigpa arise.

Also, abiding in name-basis gathering's self-resound:

# Measure (*tshad*) of Self-Arising Wisdom
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents measures for each of the five wisdoms:

1. **Ground-abiding wisdom measure:** Abiding in equal intent's warmth measure
2. **Appearance-holding wisdom measure:** Sphere-awareness mixed, knowing and self-power obtained
3. **Unceasing memory wisdom measure:** Arising-liberation marks none, gathering-dispersal exhausted, abiding in ease spontaneous intent, conditions cannot steal rigpa
4. **Individually-discriminating wisdom measure:** Two-possessing dharmas individually divided, established
5. **Three-entrance wisdom measure:** Word-meaning realized, meaning self-face abides

Simile (*mthun dpe*) and Section Completion:
The simile is like tinder (*spra ba*)—whatever object is seen is known and realized, all afflictions burned. The butter-lamp fire blazes.

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (17290-17295) and *sdud pa* (17296-17299):
- Example like tinder moisture-free
- Fire sparks subtle even meet
- Tinder all blaze fire burning

# Major Rim Khang: Four Lamps Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa concludes the thirteenth major section (*rim khang bcu gsum pa*): The Classification of the Four Lamps. The text marks this as the conclusion (*ste*) of the four-lamps presentation and prepares to transition to the second major division: establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body.

The transition formula (*de ltar...de ni*) marks the structural shift from supporting base (*rten*) to supported cognition (*brten pa shes pa*).

[17303-17306] <structure>
# Second Major Division: Supported Cognition
**Analysis:** The three topics of establishing the nature of knowing supported by that body:
1. Alaya (*kun gzhi*) and dharmakaya (*chos sku*) distinction
2. Mind (*sems*) and wisdom (*ye shes*) distinction
3. Distinct dharmas analysis

[17307-17313] <concept>
First Topic: Alaya-Dharmakaya Distinction
Brief presentation (*mdor bstan pa*):
- Sentient beings' basis and buddhas' basis considered: rigpa's essence ka dag stainless
- Stained with marigpa (*ma rig pa*), conceptualization (*rtog tshogs*)—becomes all delusion-appearance, delusion-holder's basis
- Thus alaya and dharmakaya two aspects

The *thal 'gyur* citation (17315-17316): "Alaya and dharmakaya's vital point."

[17317-17334] <concept>
Alaya (*kun gzhi*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance (*ma rig pas khyad par du byas pa*)
- Mind and mental factors' first support, middle abode, final home
- Latencies' vessel, like a pond (*rdzing*)

Dharmakaya (*chos sku*) defined:
- Made distinct by ignorance reversed (*ma rig pa log pas*)
- Beyond mind and mental factors' objects
- Pure from all action and latencies

Alaya:
- Under-barrel spread basis of various appearances
- Various objects appear in lung
- Object-possessors, six ignorance, three realms essence appear
- That body, happiness-suffering, mind's delusion parts many held

Dharmakaya:
- All these nonexistent
- Not abiding together with mind etc.

The *rang shar* citation (17335-17339):
- Alaya conceptualization holder
- Various delusion knowing stained
- Alaya ignorance entity is
- Alaya called that

And (17341-17343):
- Sentient being basis and buddha basis
- One distinction divided certainly

[17344-17360] <context>
Citation from *mu tig phreng ba*:
- Alaya accumulation's cause
- Dharmakaya outflow exhausted
- Empty clear and clear pervading
- Contemplation unstained memory-clear
- Elaboration itself free
- Sky-like pervading empty
- Self-pure all free
- Cause and condition with alaya
- Latencies etc. like pond
- Dharmakaya latencies free
- Mind and sems etc. gathering
- Embodied alaya various appears
- Dharmakaya mind etc. free
- Various form-appearance body nonexistent
