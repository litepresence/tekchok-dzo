# Beginning of Second Chapter: The Abode
**Analysis:** The text transitions to the second major section, explaining:
- **Topic:** The definite abode (*gnas nges pa*) where the teacher tames
- **First sub-topic:** Fields (*zhing khams*) and container-contained (*snod bcud*) sequence

The cosmology presented: From Vajradhara's quality-complete bodhi, abiding as Saṃbhogakāya from Dharmakāya, the five-family kāya manifests immeasurable fields. At the center (*dbus ma*), ornamented by Vairocana, are countless fields.

Specifically, our Sahā world (*mi mjed 'di*) abides at the thirteenth level of twenty-five stacked appearances (*nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsigs mar snang ba*) upon the jewel lotus (*padma rin po che*). The construction "upper-lower and directions-intervals" (*steng 'og dang phyogs mtshams*) indicates a three-dimensional maṇḍala architecture.

[578-585] [CONCEPT]
The Container-Contained Cosmology
**Analysis:** The pair *snod bcud* (container and contained) refers to:
- **Container (*snod*):** The universe, Buddha-fields, the physical environment
- **Contained (*bcud*):** Sentient beings, the animate inhabitants

This dual framework derives from Abhidharma cosmology, adapted here for Dzogchen presentation. The "sequence" (*rim pa*) indicates systematic presentation from macrocosm to microcosm.

# Quotation from sGra thal 'gyur: The Thirteen Fields
**Analysis:** The text extensively quotes the *sGra thal 'gyur* (Sound Unobstructed/Thalgyur) tantra, describing thirteen field-types (*zhing khams rnam pa bcu gsum*) arrayed around Sahā:

1. **Thal-ba-dbyangs** — Below this world, immeasurable extent
2. **Thal-ba-'dzin** — Six worlds below, wheel-shaped
3. **Thal-ba-skyob** — Three to the right, ornamented by mothers/nurses
4. **Thal-ba-brdal** — Six worlds above, lotus-blooming shape
5. **Thal-ba'i be-con** — Above nineteen worlds, skull-garland arrangement
6. **Thal-ba'i rgyun** — Northeast interval, caitya-shaped
7. **Thal-ba rgyas** — At top twenty-one, extremely pervading

The term "Thal" (*thal*) relates to the Dzogchen concept of *thal 'gyur* — unobstructed, penetrating, direct. Each field description follows a pattern: name, location relative to Sahā, shape/configuration, and teaching function.

[586-634] [PHILOLOGY]
The Particle Structure in Thalgyur Verses
**Analysis:** The verses use the terminative particle *la* (lines 587, 588) to indicate direction toward the thirteen fields and the world below. The verb *bya ba yin* (line 589) establishes categorical identity. The construction *dpag dka'* (immeasurable) + *rab tu mdzes* (extremely beautiful) employs standard *snyan ngag* (poetic) conventions.

[587-590] [STRUCTURE]
# The Thal-ba-dbyangs Field
**Analysis:** The first field described is Thal-ba-dbyangs (Thal of Melody/Sound):
- **Location:** Below this world (*'di nas 'jig rten 'og na*)
- **Extent:** Immeasurably vast (*rgya khyon dpag dka'*)
- **Function:** Teaching place where cause, condition, nature, and the teacher's teaching assembly abide

The phrase *rgyu dang rkyen dang rang bzhin dang* establishes the fourfold causal framework of Abhidharma and Yogācāra: cause (*hetu*), condition (*pratyaya*), inherent nature (*svabhāva*), and the teaching assembly.

[591-599] [STRUCTURE]
# The Thal-ba-'dzin Field
**Analysis:** The second field, Thal-ba-'dzin (Thal of Holding), appears:
- **Location:** Six worlds below (*'jig rten drug 'og na*)
- **Shape:** Wheel-configuration (*'khor lo'i dbyibs*), completely scattered/open (*zang thal lo*)
- **Function:** Teaching place of the teacher's true teaching

The term *zang thal* (completely open/scattered) describes a field without boundaries or obstructions, reflecting the Dzogchen emphasis on unobstructed awareness.

[600-606] [STRUCTURE]
# The Thal-ba-skyob Field
**Analysis:** The third field, Thal-ba-skyob (Thal of Protection), appears:
- **Location:** Three to the right of the three worlds (*'jig rten gsum g.yas na*)
- **Adornment:** Completely ornamented by mothers/nurses (*ma rged dag gis yongs spras pas*)
- **Characteristics:** Definite light and color, the taming-field of the teacher's teaching with individual karma and marks

The "three worlds" (*'jig rten gsum*) refer to desire, form, and formless realms. The "mothers/nurses" (*ma rged*) likely refer to the prajñāpāramitā as mother of all Buddhas.

[607-614] [STRUCTURE]
# The Thal-ba-brdal Field
**Analysis:** The fourth field, Thal-ba-brdal (Thal of Diffusion), appears:
- **Location:** Six worlds above (*'jig rten drug gi steng*)
- **Shape:** Blooming lotus configuration (*padma rgyas pa'i dbyibs*), extremely expansive and vast
- **Characteristics:** Varied blazing light colors—white and red appearance agitated
- **Function:** Teaching of dependent origination expanded, called "Thal of Eon Completion"

The lotus shape (*padma rgyas pa*) indicates purity rising from impurity, while the colors (white and red) suggest the union of method and wisdom.

[615-622] [STRUCTURE]
# The Thal-ba'i be-con Field
**Analysis:** The fifth field, Thal-ba'i be-con (Thal's Club/Mace), appears:
- **Location:** Above this world, beyond nineteen worlds (*bcu dgu 'das pa'i yang steng na*)
- **Adornment:** Extremely beautiful, ornamented with various jewel fragments, piled in heaps
- **Function:** Teacher's teaching possesses the two completions, adorned with skull-garland arrangement

The "nineteen worlds" (*bcu dgu*) suggests a specific cosmological calculation—likely referring to the realms below the fourth dhyāna. The skull-garland (*thod pa'i phreng ba*) indicates this is a cremation-ground field (*dur khrod*), associated with wrathful practice.

[615-622] [CONTEXT]
# Cremation Ground Symbolism
**Analysis:** The skull-garland imagery connects to:
- **Cakrasaṃvara maṇḍala:** Eight cremation grounds as outer boundaries
- **Chöd practice:** Visualization of charnel grounds
- **Dzogchen:** The dissolution of fixation in the "groundless ground"

The "two completions" (*rdzogs gnyis ldan*) likely refers to the completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) of both father (*pha rgyud*) and mother (*ma rgyud*) tantras.

[623-634] [STRUCTURE]
# The Remaining Thal Fields
**Analysis:** The text continues describing additional fields:

**Thal-ba'i rgyun (Thal of Stream):**
- **Location:** Northeast interval (*byang shar mtshams*)
- **Shape:** Caitya-configuration (*mchod rten dbyibs*), beautiful tiered structure
- **Adornment:** Five arrangements completely ornamented
- **Function:** Source of various sound-melodies, teaching of temporal arising

**Thal-ba rgyas (Expanded Thal):**
- **Location:** Above, at twenty-one (*de steng nyi shu rtsa gcig na*)
- **Characteristics:** Extremely pervasive (*rab tu thal bas khyab*), nature of pure perception
- **Appearance:** External and internal completely open/scattered
- **Function:** Demonstrates the arising of teaching, completely pervading causal conditions

[623-634] [PHILOLOGY]
The Particle *kyis* as Instrumental
**Analysis:** The phrase *bkod pa lnga yis yongs su spras* (completely ornamented by five arrangements) uses *yis* (instrumental) to indicate means. The construction *rab tu thal bas khyab* (extremely pervading with thal) uses the instrumental *bas* to indicate manner. The verb *'byung* (arise) in *'byung ba ston* (demonstrates arising) establishes the teaching function: these fields DEMONSTRATE the principles they embody.
