# The Two Truths Framework: Introduction
**Analysis:** Lines 2836-2848 introduce the foundational Buddhist philosophical framework of the Two Truths (*bden pa gnyis*), which structures the entire Mahāyāna presentation. This section serves as the doctrinal gateway to understanding how phenomena exist.

**Threefold Structure:**
1. **Line 2836-2837:** General proposition - all phenomena contained in saṃsāra-nirvāṇa are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths
2. **Lines 2838-2846:** Scriptural authority - citations from Root Wisdom (*Rtsa ba shes rab*) and Māyājāla Tantra
3. **Lines 2847-2848:** Definition and division - conventional truth defined, with twofold subdivision

**Section Function:** This establishes the hermeneutical key for all subsequent philosophical analysis—nothing exists outside the framework of the two truths.

## Terminology of the Two Truths
**Analysis:**

**Core Framework:**
- *Bden pa gnyis* — Two Truths (*satyadvaya*)
  - *Bden pa* — truth, reality (Skt. *satya*)
  - *Gnyis* — two
  
**Comprehensive Scope:**
- *Snang srid 'khor 'das kyis bsdus pa* — gathered/collected by appearance-existence, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa
  - *Snang srid* — appearance-existence (all that appears and exists)
  - *'Khor 'das* — saṃsāra and nirvāṇa
  - *Kyis* — instrumental (by means of)
  - *Bsdus pa* — gathered, collected, included

**Self-Nature:**
- *Rang bzhin du 'dus* — gathered into self-nature
  - Indicates the two truths are not external categories but inherent modes of being

**Scriptural Citations:**
1. *Rtsa ba shes rab* — Root Wisdom (Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*)
   - *Sangs rgyas rnams kyis chos bstan pa* — Buddhas' teaching of Dharma
   - *Bden pa gnyis la yang dag brten* — depends on the two truths

2. Two Truths Defined:
   - *'Jig rten kun rdzob bden pa* — Conventional truth of the world (*saṃvṛtisatya*)
   - *Dam pa'i don gyi bden pa* — Ultimate truth of the sublime meaning (*paramārthasatya*)

3. *Sgyu 'phrul* — Māyājāla Tantra
   - *Bden pa gnyis kyi tshul la gnas* — abiding in the mode of the two truths

**Conventional Truth Defined:**
- *Chos can* — subjects/entities with characteristics
- *Mtsan mar snang ba* — appearing as marks/signs
- *Blo'i yul du snang rung* — able to appear as objects of mind
- *Kun rdzobs kyi bden pa* — conventional truth

**Twofold Division:**
- *Dbye na* — if divided/analyzed
- *Log pa dang yang dag kun rdzob gnyis* — false and true conventional
  - *Log pa* — false, erroneous
  - *Yang dag* — true, correct

## The Two Truths in Mahāyāna Doxography
**Analysis:** The two truths framework is the cornerstone of Mahāyāna philosophy:

**Nāgārjuna's Foundation:**
The citation from *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* XXIV.8-9 establishes:
- Buddhas teach dependent on the two truths
- Without conventional truth, ultimate cannot be taught
- Without ultimate, nirvāṇa cannot be attained

**Māyājāla Tantra Integration:**
The Nyingma tantric source demonstrates:
- Two truths extend to Vajrayāna
- Not merely philosophical but practical
- Basis for Dzogchen view

**Doxographical Distinctions:**

**Prasaṅgika vs. Svātantrika:**
- Prasaṅgika: Conventional = mere appearance, Ultimate = emptiness beyond all conceptual determination
- Svātantrika: Conventional = intrinsic characteristics, Ultimate = absence of ultimate existence

**Yogācāra Interpretation:**
- Conventional = parikalpita (imagined) + paratantra (dependent)
- Ultimate = pariniṣpanna (perfected)

**Nyingma Synthesis:**
Longchenpa integrates these into a coherent framework where:
- Conventional truth = manifestation (*snang ba*)
- Ultimate truth = emptiness (*stong pa*)
- Non-dual = appearance-emptiness inseparable (*snang stong dbyer med*)

## Two Truths as Epistemological Framework
**Analysis:** The two truths are not ontological dualities but epistemological perspectives:

**Conventional Truth (*Kun rdzob bden pa*):**
Functional reality for unenlightened beings:
- Appearances function
- Causality operates
- Suffering and liberation occur

**Ultimate Truth (*Don dam bden pa*):**
Reality from enlightened perspective:
- Beyond all conceptual elaboration
- Empty of intrinsic existence
- Inexpressible, unthinkable

**False vs. True Conventional:**
1. **False Conventional (*Log pa'i kun rdzob*):**
   - Misapprehending appearances as truly existent
   - Ordinary deluded perception
   - Subject to error

2. **True Conventional (*Yang dag kun rdzob*):**
   - Correctly apprehending appearances as mere appearances
   - Undeluded conventional perception
   - Accurate relative knowledge

**Dzogchen Transcendence:**
Beyond both truths:
- Not trapped in conventional reification
- Not attached to ultimate emptiness
- Ground (*gzhi*) beyond both
- Spontaneously present (*lhun grub*) non-dual awareness

**Pedagogical Function:**
The two truths provide:
- Entry point for beginners (conventional)
- Ultimate goal (ultimate)
- Bridge between them (understanding their non-duality)
