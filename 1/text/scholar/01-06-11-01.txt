Individual Nature Empowerments

**With Elaboration Power Classification:**
With elaboration from body, etc., gatherings purifies and joins to body vajra.
Thus:
- Body deity purified
- Speech mantra purified
- Mind samādhi purified
- Consciousness dharmatā purified

Without elaboration: outer appearance's entity delusion ceases.
Greatly without elaboration: joins to four activities.
Utterly without elaboration: body bliss, speech clear, mind non-conceptual, consciousness non-dual power possessing.

**Four Empowerments' Changes Examination:**
Four empowerments' power definite classification: outer, inner, secret, completely perfect—divisions numerous.

Example: vase empowerment ripens form body—various particularities, definite.
Secret ripens speech body.
Wisdom-gnosis ripens mind body.
Word ripens dharmakāya.

Like within single seed various particularities exist: sprout, stem, leaf, flower, fruit definite.

Empowerment individual power: four empowerments' ripening of individual afflicted and karmic obscurations.

With elaboration's sixteen: outer elements, inner body, secret mind, completely perfect consciousness—definite.
Without elaboration's sixteen likewise.
Greatly without elaboration's sixteen likewise.
Utterly without elaboration's sixteen likewise.

Altogether 64 definite.

**Four Empowerments' Definite Ripening:**
Vase: body aggregates, constituents, sense-bases.
Secret: speech's afflictions.
Wisdom-gnosis: mind's obscurations.
Word: consciousness dharmatā.

From general to specific definite: four empowerments' four-four = sixteen.
Like seed's sprout, etc., definite.

2. Rnam shes gzhan grong 'jug (entering others' bodies):
   - Yid kyi rang bzhin (mind's nature) flexibility
   - Gzhan lus (other bodies) entry

3. 'Chi ba rang grol (self-liberated death):

Element and Affliction Purification

**Four Empowerments' Definite Purification:**
Four empowerments' definite purification: body, speech, mind, consciousness four.
Each divided into:
- Affliction obscuration
- Karmic obscuration
- Definite: four-four = sixteen

Like four elements' definite: earth, water, fire, wind each with individual characteristics—definite.
Thus body, speech, mind, consciousness each with individual obscurations.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Four empowerments' definite divisions
Body, speech, mind, consciousness four
Affliction and karmic obscurations
Definite sixteen"

**Earth Element Example:**
Earth's characteristics: color, odor, taste, touch.
Earth's functions: supporting, producing, holding, ripening.
Earth's divisions: hard, soft, etc.
Thus definite.

Likewise four empowerments: individual characteristics, functions, divisions—definite.

**Sixty-four Fold Classification:**
Four empowerments four each = sixteen.
Each with method, prajñā two = thirty-two.
Each with self, other two = sixty-four.

Thus definite ripening measure.

Symbolic-Actual Hermeneutics

The brda-don (symbol-meaning) distinction derives from:
- Nitartha-neyartha: Definitive vs provisional meaning
- Vajrayana: Outer, inner, secret, perfect levels
- Nyingma: Thun mong and thun mong ma yin pa'i don

Each defilement has:
- Brda (symbol): Surface appearance
- Don (actual): Deep meaning
- Two aspects x sixteen defilements = thirty-two

Detailed Element Analysis

Four empowerments with method-prajñā two-two divided = eight purify.

Body's element particularities:
Earth, etc., four each with earth's earth, etc., four-four divided = sixteen.
Hot and cold two divisions = sixty-four.
Above symbolic-meaning division's empowerment sixty-four purifies.

Also four elements each well divided:
Earth's sixty-four.
Spreading element common body and
Individual characteristic possessing actual body two divided:
Earth's different bodies hundred and twenty-eight.
Likewise divided water, fire,
Wind hundred twenty-eight group three,
Altogether five hundred twelve bodies ripen.

Thus outer body ripened, inner afflictions also:
Attachment looked, smiled, embraced, embraced—four with element body four-four = sixteen.
Delusion with stupidity not knowing, obscured, intoxicated, greatly ignorance mixed—four with four = sixteen.

[8975-9000] [CONCEPT]
Four-fold Freedom from Object

The bliss experience is free from:
1. Gzung yul (grasped object): No external focus
2. 'Dzin byed (grasping subject): No internal grasper
3. Brjod byed (expression): No verbal formulation
4. Rtogs byed (cognition): No conceptual recognition

This corresponds to:
- Stong gsum (three emptinesses): Subject, object, action
- Bzhi stong (four emptinesses): Above plus ground
- Dzogchen: Kadag beyond all reference

**Summary:**

Page 211 completes the guru-disciple transmission with three-fold body-speech-mind integration, mantra and wind practices, mirror reception, and non-dual bliss recognition. Philologically, the text employs integration verbs, sonic terminology, mirror symbolism, and non-conceptual experience vocabulary. Contextual sources include Guhyasamaja, Hevajra, Six Yogas, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates progressive identification through four empowerments, sonic-energetic correspondence, mirror symbolism for direct introduction, and four-fold freedom culminating in mute's dream metaphor for inexpressible realization.

   - Appearances and consciousness constructs continue

2. Sequential requirements:
   - Each level prepares for next

   - Different beings need different approaches
   - Four empowerments match four capacities
   - Complete range covered
