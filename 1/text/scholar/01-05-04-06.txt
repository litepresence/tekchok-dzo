Teaching Transmission Lineage

**Seven Cycles Framework:**
The text describes the transmission through seven teaching cycles (bstan pa bdun) across different world-systems:
1. First aeon: Dharmamegha-yeśrīdhipati Buddha
2. Second: Sphuḍa-jagat-meaning "world-crest" or "crown of existence"
3. Third: Brahmā-sahasra-yeśrīdhipati
4. Fourth: Sūrya-sahasra-rāja
5. Fifth: Dvāra-meaning "door" or "entrance"
6. Sixth: Āṃśu-sahasra-mukha-parigṛhītadhipati
7. Seventh: 'Khor ba-'jig-rgyal ba (Cyclic-existence-destroyer)

**Temporal Scope:**
The teaching endures for sixty-four great aeons (bsegs kal 'bum phrag drug cu rtsa bzhi) from the first Buddha Mngon 'phags dran pa mgon to the Buddha of the contention aeon (rtsod ldan), Dharaṇīsmṛti-jñānadhipati.

**Buddha Enumeration:**
The text enumerates 64,000 Buddhas (bsegs kal 'bum phrag drug cu rtsa bzhi) holding this teaching, with 19,000 emanated Buddhas (sa ya phrag bcu dgu) manifesting in Jambudvīpa to tame beings. This reflects the Mahāyāna concept of innumerable Buddhas manifesting according to capacities.

Fruition Through Contact ('bras bu'i thus ka)

**The Thus-ka Principle:**
The text introduces *'bras bu'i thus ka* (fruition's vital essence/contact) as a central Dzogchen concept—liberation achieved through mere encounter with the teaching without elaborate practice. This represents the *snang ba ngos 'dzin* (recognizing appearances) approach unique to Atiyoga.

**Liberation Scenarios:**
1. **This life** (tshe 'di): 100,000 beings liberate within sixty years
2. **Bardo** (bar do): Recognition of appearances leads to liberation
3. **Future lives**: Rebirth in pure realms (zhing khams)

**Gender Distribution:**
The enumeration specifies gender proportions—70,000 women (bud med) and 2,000 men (skyes pa) in the initial phase, reversing in later periods. This reflects tantric emphasis on feminine wisdom principles (shes rab, prajñā) as primary vehicles.

**Mechanism:**
Liberation occurs through the *nus pa thogs med* (unobstructed power) of the teaching combined with faith (*mos pa*), demonstrating the *dbang* (empowerment) principle that blessings (*byin rlabs*) can mature beings instantly.

Liberation Enumerations and Categories

[6547-6561]
**Liberation in This Life:**
The text quantifies liberation in the current life (tshe 'dir 'byung ba rang dag gi grangs):
- All who have accumulated merit (*bsod nams rgya chen po*) over many aeons
- Those who encounter this teaching (gsang chen 'di dang phrad pa)
- Even those with only common vehicle contact (thun mong gi theg pa dang 'phrad pa tsam)

The mechanism depends on encountering the *'bras bu'i thus ka* (fruition essence), which has unobstructed power (*nus pa thogs med*) to liberate through faith alone.

[6562-6582]
**Bardo Liberation Enumerations:**
Drawing from *Bskod pa chen po* (Great Arrangement Tantra), the text specifies bardo liberation numbers:
- 1,000 liberated between ages 60 and 50 (liberation into self-ground)
- 200,000 attain birthlessness (skye med) between ages 50 and 30
- 600,000 between ages 30 and 10
- Gender distribution shifts: predominantly male in later periods

The liberation occurs through the *ngo 'phrod* (introduction/recognition) gateway—those who see the introduction are established in the bardo ye-shes lamp (*bar do ye shes kyi sgron me*).

Rigdzin Prophecies and Etymology

**Lineage Holders Predicted:**
Quoting from *Thal 'gyur*, the text predicts lineage holders after the teacher's parinirvāṇa:
1. **Uḍḍiyāna, west**: Dhana-kośa's goddess (*lha lc*am), motherless child *Vajra He* (btsa ma btsun mo Vajra He)
2. **West**: Brahmin youth *Mañjuśrī-pati* (seventy-five years old)
3. **So-sha-gling**: Householder *Śrī-siṃha*
4. **Subsequent**: *Jñāna-sūtra* (caṇḍala caste)
5. **Subsequent**: Householder caste holding Mahāmudrā
6. **Subsequent**: King caste with emanations and statues
7. **Subsequent**: Monk form *Lhun-gyi rgyal mtshan*
8. **Subsequent**: *Siddha-śvara*
9. **Subsequent**: Earth-dwelling Bodhisattvas
10. **Subsequent**: Vajrapāṇi emanation *Vajra-phala*
11. **Subsequent**: King *Siṃha*
12. **Subsequent**: *Bzang po*
13. **Subsequent**: *Sgra mkhar dpa'*
14. **Subsequent**: *Yogi sraba*
15. **Subsequent**: King *Khri 'od*
16. **Subsequent**: Monk *Dpal dang ldan*
17. **Subsequent**: *Blo gros mchog*
18. **Subsequent**: Ḍākinī *Dpal 'dzin ma*

**Vimalamitra Prophecy:**
The text identifies the author's teacher *Dge slong Dpal dang ldan* (Kumararaja) as an emanation of *Bi ma mi tra*, with specific signs: "born with the sign of Smemarks on the nose-tip, possessing special instruction-keypoints (*man ngag gi gnad*) surpassing others, displaying clairvoyance (*mngon par shes pa*) prophecying the future, clarifying difficult points (*dka' ba'i gnas*), and displaying extraordinary signs at death."

Emanation Theory and Cyclic Teaching

**Emanation Cosmology:**
All manifestation flows from Kun-tu bzang-po's (*Samantabhadra*) compassion, with:
- Sixty-four thousand great emanations (*sprul pa chen po*)
- Nineteen thousand specific emanations for Jambudvīpa
- Activity immeasurable even by tenth-ground Bodhisattvas

**Cyclic Renewal:**
After the teaching completes seven cycles across seven Buddhafields (Beautiful-array, Vast-protection, etc.), cyclic existence is "hollowed out" (*'khor ba dong sprugs*)—becoming empty for twenty thousand great aeons (*bsegs kal stong phrag nyi shu*). Then:
- Beings reappear from the expanse (*dbyings*)
- Taming teachers manifest from Samantabhadra's blessing
- Teaching's three supports (*bstan pa'i rten gsum*) self-arise without decline

[6685-6755] <concept>
Dharmatā and Original Ground

**Dharmatā Dissolution:**
When Vajradhara's arranged Brahma aeon completes:
- Container and contents (*snod bcud*) with their thousands dissolve
- Space becomes one (*nam mkha' gcig tu gyur*)
- Eighty-five aeons of emptiness
- Teaching's three supports dissolve into dharmatā's peaceful expanse (*chos nyid zhi ba'i dbyings*), becoming invisible

**Two Interpretations:**
1. **Universal Liberation**: Kun-tu bzang-po liberates all in his mandala
2. **Vajradhara's Mandala**: Only those in his specific arrangement are liberated

These are non-contradictory: Kun-tu bzang-po's compassion liberates all, yet from the expanse infinite latent tendencies (*bag la nyal*) can still arise.

**Soteriological Implication:**
The text emphasizes that the greatest scope of liberation (*grol ba rgya che shos*) should be understood as supreme—even if it takes immeasurable time, all will eventually be liberated through cyclic renewal.

[6756-6758] <structure>
Empowerment Ground Framework

[6756-6758]
**Five Difficult Points Section:**
The text transitions to the fifth section (*rim khang lnga pa*) on difficult points (*dka' ba'i gnas*) in the definitive meaning of Secret Great Vehicle (*gsang chen nges pa'i don*). This establishes the framework for entering unsurpassed vehicle (*bla med pa'i theg par 'jug pa'i sgo*) through empowerment (*dbang*).
