Introduction to Two Truths Framework
**Analysis:** Longchenpa initiates the discussion of the two truths (bden pa gnyis) as the framework for understanding the paths of the vehicles (*theg pa*). The structure follows the standard threefold presentation:

1. **Ground** (*gzh*): Knowing the nature of the two truths [2833]
2. **Path** (*lam*): How to practice having understood [2834]
3. **Result** ('*bras bu*): The final fruition of complete path [2835]

This structure reflects the *gzh-lam-'bras* topology common in Tibetan Buddhist literature, particularly in *sngags* (tantric) presentations.

Two Truths: Conventional and Ultimate
**Key Terms:**

**Kun rdzob bden pa** (conventional truth):
- *Kun*: all, entirely
- *Rdzob*: cover, conceal, veil
- Literally "all-veiling truth"—that which covers the ultimate truth

**Dam pa'i don gyi bden pa** (ultimate truth):
- *Dam pa*: sublime, supreme
- *Don*: meaning, object
- Literally "truth of the sublime meaning"

**Analysis of [2839-2842]:**
The citation from Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* establishes scriptural authority:

*Sangs rgyas rnams kyis chos bstan pa dang / bden pa gnyis la yang dag brten / 'jig rten kun rdzob bden pa dang / dam pa'i don gyi bden pa'o*

Grammatical structure:
- **la brten**: dependent upon (locative + verb)
- **yang dag**: correctly, properly
- The verse indicates that all Buddha's teachings rely (*brten*) on the two truths

**Doctrinal Context:**
This verse (MMK 24:8-9) is the locus classicus for the two truths doctrine in Madhyamaka. Nāgārjuna argues that without the conventional, the ultimate cannot be taught; without the ultimate, nirvāṇa cannot be attained.

Conventional Truth and Its Divisions
**Analysis:**

The definition of conventional truth at [2847]: *chos can mtshan mar snang ba blo'i yul du snang rung rnams ni kun rdzobs kyi bden pa*—"all phenomena appearing as signs within the sphere of mind are conventional truth."

**Key Distinction:**
The text divides conventional truth into:
1. **Log pa'i kun rdzob** (false conventional): Mistaken appearances
2. **Yang dag kun rdzob** (true conventional): Correct but conventional

This division originates with Candrakīrti's *Madhyamakāvatāra* and is standard in Tibetan *grub mtha'* literature.

**Epistemological Point:**
The definition emphasizes *blo'i yul* (mind's object/scope)—conventional truth is that which can appear to mind. This is crucial: conventional truth is not "false" in a simple sense, but is mind-dependent (*blo btags*).

[2849-2872] <context>
True and False Conventional in Detail
**Analysis:**

**False Conventional** [2849-2853]:
*Snang srid snod bcud blos bkod pa'i chos so cog dang bcas pa thams cad log pa'i kun rdzob*—"All phenomena included in the container and contained, fabricated by mind, are false conventional."

The four characteristics (*sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad*):
1. *Med pa gsal snang* — appearing clearly while non-existent
2. *Don byed nus pa* — capable of functional efficacy
3. *Brtags na ngo bo nyid kyis dben pa* — empty of inherent nature when examined
4. *Sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad* — illustrated by eight similes of illusion

**True Conventional** [2862-2869]:
*'Khrul par snang yang bde 'gro dang thar pa'i rgyu byed pa*—"Appearing as confusion yet causing higher realms and liberation."

This includes:
- Ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*)
- Perfection of generosity (*sbyin pa*)
- Accumulation of merit (*bsod nams*)
- Path-exertion samādhi (*ting 'dzin*)

The distinction is functional: false conventional leads to suffering, true conventional leads to liberation—both are ultimately empty.

**Dharmakīrti's Influence:**
The definition reflects Dharmakīrti's epistemology: *don byed nus pa* (able to perform functions) is the mark of the real conventionally.

[2870-2872] <concept>
Ultimate Truth: Definition and Divisions
**Analysis:**

**Definition** [2870]:
*Chos nyid rang bzhin du gnas pa stong pa nyid kyi ngo bo*—"Dharmatā naturally abiding, the essence of emptiness."

Key terms:
- *Chos nyid*: dharmatā—the nature of phenomena
- *Rang bzhin*: inherent nature, but here meaning "natural state"
- *Stong pa nyid*: emptiness (śūnyatā)

**Two-fold Division** [2871-2872]:
1. **Rnam grangs pa**: Nominal ultimate—meaning indicated by words/signs
2. **Rnam grangs pa ma yin pa**: Non-nominal ultimate—actual reality

This distinction is crucial in Madhyamaka: the nominal ultimate is a pedagogical tool; the non-nominal is the actual realization that transcends all indication.

**Philosophical Significance:**
The two truths are not two realities but two perspectives on one reality. As Nāgārjuna says: "There is not the slightest difference between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. There is not the slightest difference between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra." (MMK 25:19-20)
