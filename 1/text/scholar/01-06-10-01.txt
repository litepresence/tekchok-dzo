Four Empowerments' Ripening Power

Four empowerments' ripening time ripening signs impure and pure two included—gathered into space and field two.

Attachment, hatred, neutral three, time three gathered—body, speech, mind three ripening activity liberated.

Samsara-nirvana dharmas contaminated, uncontaminated two empowered—two arisen:
- Empowerment over appearance purifies aggregates, constituents, sense-bases, etc.
- Empowerment over existence purifies afflictions

With elaboration shows body, speech, mind, consciousness four entering activities.
Without elaboration shows four: obtaining, abiding, stabilizing, closely realizing.
Greatly without elaboration shows four causes/conditions of body, speech, mind, consciousness ripening.
Utterly without elaboration shows four: three doors matured into deity body, speech, mind and engaging in inexpressible meaning.

**Four Empowerments' Ripening Example:**
Like good field sown with faultless seeds ripening fruit—first with elaboration empowerment sows seed, without elaboration sprout emerges and leaves spread, greatly without elaboration flower blooms, utterly without elaboration four bodies definite fruit ripens.

Three Kaya Realization as Ground

The final realization manifests as:
1. G.yo ba (moving): Unstable stage
   - Tha mal pa'i 'dod pa (ordinary desire)
   - Lta ba g.yo ba'i dus (time of moving view)

2. Thob pa (attained): Stabilization
   - Tha mal pa'i rtog pa med pa (no ordinary conceptuality)
   - Lta ba thob pa'i dus (time of attained view)

3. Brten pa (stable): Complete realization
   - Lus sems gnyis med (body-mind non-dual)
   - Phyag rgya chen po blo las 'das pa'i don (great mudra meaning beyond mind)
   - 'Pho 'gyur med pa (without transition or change)

**Summary:**

Page 206 presents Great Mudra realization, thigle retention methods, channel opening signs, the five stages of blissful wisdom, and three kaya stabilization. Philologically, the text employs causative and resultative constructions, ordinal enumeration, and achievement terminology. Contextual sources include Hevajra, Guhyasamaja, Kalachakra, Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü, and Dzogchen systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates the progression from four mudras to Great Mudra, the indicators of successful thigle practice, the five-fold dissolution of bliss, and the stabilization of view in the three kaya ground.

Two Truths Integration in Practice

The two bodhicittas correspond to:
- Kun rdzob: Sems tsam (mind-only) and tantric completion stage

Greatly without elaboration: joins to four activities.
Utterly without elaboration: body bliss, speech clear, mind non-conceptual, consciousness non-dual power possessing.

**Four Empowerments' Changes Examination:**
Four empowerments' power definite classification: outer, inner, secret, completely perfect—divisions numerous.

Example: vase empowerment ripens form body—various particularities, definite.
Secret ripens speech body.
Wisdom-gnosis ripens mind body.
Word ripens dharmakāya.

Like within single seed various particularities exist: sprout, stem, leaf, flower, fruit definite.

Empowerment individual power: four empowerments' ripening of individual afflicted and karmic obscurations.

With elaboration's sixteen: outer elements, inner body, secret mind, completely perfect consciousness—definite.
Without elaboration's sixteen likewise.
Greatly without elaboration's sixteen likewise.
Utterly without elaboration's sixteen likewise.

Altogether 64 definite.

**Four Empowerments' Definite Ripening:**
