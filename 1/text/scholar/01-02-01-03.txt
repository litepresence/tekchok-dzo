[997-997] <context>

**Analysis:** The second tier (*bang rim gnyis pa*) of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three (*sum cu rtsa gsum*) houses gods who wear flower garlands (*me tog gi phreng ba thogs pa'i lha*). These deities embody aesthetic refinement—the progression from the first tier's protective hand-screens to floral adornment indicates the ascending subtlety of desire-realm enjoyments. The flower garland represents accumulated merit manifesting as beauty, yet remains within the realm of conditioned form.
