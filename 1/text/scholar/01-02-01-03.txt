[997-997] <structure>

**Organizational Context:** This verse occupies the second tier (bang rim gnyis pa) of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three (sum cu rtsa gsum), representing the second of three progressively elevated levels within this desire-realm heaven. The Heaven of the Thirty-Three, situated on the slopes of Mount Sumeru, houses the gods of the trayastrimsa realm who enjoy the results of meritorious actions accumulated during human existence. This particular verse marks the transition from the first tier's emphasis on protective/ceremonial functions to the second tier's aesthetic and ornamental dimensions.

**Structural Function:** The progression across the three tiers demonstrates the hierarchical organization of desire-realm heavens, where each successive level represents increasingly refined modes of sensory enjoyment. This verse completes the presentation of the second tier's characteristic deities, preparing for the third tier's depiction of sensory intoxication.

** Tibetan Text Analysis:**
- གཉིས་པ་ (gnyis pa): "Second" ordinal numeral - functioning as the primary identifier for this tier; the -pa suffix nominalizes the cardinal number གཉིས (gnyis) indicating position in a sequence
- ལ་ (la): dative-locative particle marking the domain/level being described
- མེ་ཏོག (me tog): "flower" - compound noun; མེ་ (me) etymologically related to fire/light imagery, though here clearly denotes botanical flowers; ཏོག (tog) functions as nominalizer
- གི་ (gi): genitive-ergative particle connecting མེ་ཏོག to the following noun
- ཕྲེང་བ (phreng ba): "garland, wreath" - verbal noun from ཕྲེང (phreng) meaning to string together or arrange in sequence; denotes decorative arrangement
- ཐོགས་པ (thogs pa): "holding, bearing" - past-tense participle from ཐོགས (thogs) meaning to take hold of or possess; here indicates the characteristic activity of these deities
- ལྷ (lha): "god, deity" - core noun indicating the beings inhabiting this tier

**Grammatical Analysis:** The construction follows a nominal phrase structure with གཉིས་པ་ལ་ establishing the spatial domain, followed by a descriptive compound མེ་ཏོག་གི་ཕྲེང་བ་ཐོགས་པའི་ modifying ལྷ. The འི་ (yi) relative particle connects the descriptive clause to the noun it characterizes.

**Doctrinal Framework:** The Heaven of the Thirty-Three represents one of the six desire-realm heavens (kāmadhātu), situated between the Four Great Kings' heaven (cāturmahārājika) above the slopes of Mount Sumeru and the Tuṣita heaven above. The thirty-three gods (trayastrimsa) include Śakra/Indra as their chief deity and various classes of divine beings organized hierarchically.

**Tiered Structure:** The three tiers (bang rim) of this heaven correspond to different categories of divine inhabitants:
- First tier: Gods who perform protective functions, making hand-screens (phyogs skyong)
- Second tier: Gods adorned with flower garlands (this verse)
- Third tier: Gods intoxicated by honey-wine (subsequent verse)

This progression illustrates the increasing subtlety of desire-realm pleasure—from physical protection to aesthetic appreciation to sensory intoxication—demonstrating how even divine beings remain within the cycle of saṃsāra governed by karma and defilement.

**Symbolic Significance:** The flower garland (phreng ba) represents accumulated merit manifesting as beauty and refinement. Unlike the protective hand-screens of the first tier, which emphasize functional/protective aspects, the flower garland symbolizes the aesthetic dimension of heavenly existence—the appreciation of beauty as a fruit of virtuous action.

** soteriological Implications:** Despite their elevated status, these deities remain within the desire realm and thus within saṃsāra. Their enjoyment of floral beauty, while superior to human pleasures, still constitutes attachment to conditioned existence. The Great Perfection (rdzogs chen) perspective would view even these divine realms as provisional appearances arising from the ground (gzhi), ultimately empty of inherent existence.

**Hermeneutical Function:** This verse demonstrates the Abhisamayālaṃkāra's detailed cosmology, showing how Buddhist textual traditions elaborate the structure of worldly realms as objects of knowledge for beings on the path. The precise enumeration of divine hierarchies serves pedagogical functions, illustrating karmic causation and the nature of saṃsāric existence.
