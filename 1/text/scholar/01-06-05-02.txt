Second Category: Feeling as Object of Experiential Contact
**Analysis:** This passage marks the second category (*gnyis pa*) in a classification system concerning the phenomenological dimensions of experience. The structure presents a systematic analysis of how consciousness engages with objects, specifically focusing on the role of feeling (*tshor ba*) in the process of experiential contact. This enumeration appears within a broader framework mapping the mechanics of perception and experience within the Dzogchen epistemological model.

Philological Analysis
**Analysis:** The Tibetan terminology requires careful parsing:
- *Gnyis pa* (second) - ordinal marker indicating position in enumeration
- *Tshor ba* (feeling/sensation) - one of the five aggregates (*phung po lnga*), specifically the fourth, referring to the affective dimension of experience
- *Myong ba'i* (of experiencing) - verbal noun from *myong ba* (to experience/taste), indicating direct experiential engagement
- *Dngos rjes* (object/result) - "the object of" or "the result of" - indicating the target or outcome of the experiential process
- *La* (locative marker) - indicates the object toward which the activity is directed
- *Pho ba* (engagement/application) - the act of proceeding toward or engaging with

The compound *tshor ba myong ba'i dngos rjes la pho ba* thus means "engagement toward the object of feeling's experiencing" - the mechanism by which feeling consciousness contacts its objects.

Philosophical Context: Feeling in Buddhist Phenomenology
**Analysis:** The category of feeling (*tshor ba*) holds crucial importance in Buddhist phenomenology:
- In the five aggregates (*phung po lnga*), feeling is the fourth aggregate
- Feeling is distinguished from perception (*'du ses*) and formation (*'du byed*)
- It is the bare affective tone - pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral

This enumeration appears to analyze the mechanics of how feeling functions as a bridge between consciousness and objects:
1. Consciousness (*rnam par she sa*) - the knowing faculty
2. Feeling (*tshor ba*) - the affective coloring
3. The engagement with objects - how feeling relates to experience

Doctrinal Significance: Feeling and Liberation
**Analysis:** The Dzogchen view of feeling:
- Ordinary feeling binds beings through attachment to pleasant sensations and aversion to unpleasant ones
- Recognizing the empty nature of feeling leads to liberation from its binding power
- The "experiential contact" (*tshor ba myong ba*) is an opportunity for recognition

In the context of Dzogchen practice:
- All experiences - including feelings - are seen as displays of awareness
- The object of feeling's experience is empty of inherent existence
- Through recognizing this, feeling transforms from a source of bondage to a vehicle for realization

Relationship to Buddhist Epistemology
**Analysis:** This analysis connects to the Buddhist epistemological framework concerning perception and consciousness:
- *Tshor ba* corresponds to the *vedanā* skandha in standard Buddhist doctrine
- The analysis of "experiential contact" relates to *sparśa* (contact) - the sense object meeting the sense faculty
- This enumeration seems to present a sophisticated phenomenological analysis of how awareness engages with phenomena

The technical phrasing suggests this belongs to a section analyzing the structures of consciousness and their objects, a topic extensively treated in both mainstream Buddhist philosophy and the specialized Dzogchen analysis of mind phenomena (*sems kyi chos*).
