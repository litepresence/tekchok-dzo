: Seven branches (yan lag bdun): snyan ngag (poetry/kāvya), brda' gsang (secret symbols/sandhabhāṣa), grub mtha' (philosophical systems), bsdus don (condensed meaning), mchan 'grel (annotations), le'u 'grel (chapter commentary), gal mdo (critical analysis)—the complete scholarly apparatus for textual study.

<context> This passage establishes the practical requirements for Dzogchen realization—diligent practice supported by comprehensive study. The seven branches represent the complete Tibetan monastic curriculum applied to Dzogchen texts. The emphasis on "this life's body" (tshe 'di'i lus) reflects Nyingma assertions about attainability of full awakening in a single lifetime, distinct from gradualist paths requiring countless eons. The reference to six applications (sbyor drug) of Guhyasamāja completion stage demonstrates Dzogchen's integration of classical tantric methodology while transcending it.
