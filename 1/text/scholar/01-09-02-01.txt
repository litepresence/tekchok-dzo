Spontaneous Presence (lhun grub)

**Spontaneous Presence Definition:**
Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*): naturally perfect, not accomplished by effort.

From *Rang shar*:
"Spontaneous presence thus
Naturally perfect
Not accomplished effort
Spontaneous thus"

**Three Spontaneous Presences:**
1. **Essence spontaneously present** (*ngo bo lhun grub*): self-arisen wisdom
2. **Nature spontaneously present** (*rang bzhin lhun grub*): five lights
3. **Compassion spontaneously present** (*thugs rje lhun grub*): five Buddha families

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Three spontaneous presences
Essence, nature, compassion
Threefold presence
Complete thus"

**Relation to Primordial Purity:**
Primordial purity: essence aspect.
Spontaneous presence: nature aspect.
Two aspects one ground—inseparable.

From *De nyid*:
"Primordial purity essence
Spontaneous presence nature
Two aspects one
Inseparable thus"

Transition to Symbolic Presentation: The Narrative of Vajrasattva's Delusion
This section transitions to the tenth section's first topic: the manner of delusion from basis through three non-recognitions and four conditions (dang po ni gzhi las gzhi snang du shar dus ma rig pa gsum dang rkyen bzhis 'khrul te, 12478-12479). The Rang shar tantra citation (12480-12498) presents Vajrasattva's delusion narrative through symbolic coordinates: (1) kye grogs po dag (O companions!, 12481) - vocative address; (2) dag pa'i sangs rgyas la 'khrul pa mi mnga' yang (though pure buddhas don't possess delusion, 12482); (3) rdo rje sems dpa' gzhi thog nas 'khrul lugs ni (Vajrasattva's delusion mode from basis-beginning, 12483); (4) yul yangs pa can zhes bya ba nas 'khrul lo (deluded from "Broad-land", 12484); (5) gnas mdzes ldan zhes bya ba nas 'khrul lo (deluded from "Beautiful-abode", 12485); (6) dus nam sros pa dang 'khrul lo (deluded at time "Sros", 12486); (7) lo phag gi lo la 'khrul lo (deluded in pig-year, 12487); (8) nyi ma sprul gyi nyi ma la 'khrul lo (deluded on emanation-sun day, 12488); (9) skar ma bya la 'khrul lo (deluded at Bird-star, 12489); (10) mi'i ming ni rgan po ling tog can zhes bya ba 'khrul lo (deluded with human name "Old-man Top-knot", 12490); (11) rus ni ma nges pa las 'khrul lo (deluded from uncertain caste, 12491); (12) rogs mi bzhi byas so (made four companions, 12492); (13) mi rgod pa lnga byung ngo (five robbers arose, 12493); (14) rgyab rten pa mi gcig byung ngo (one supporter arose, 12494); (15) rkun mo mi gcig byung ngo (one thief arose, 12495); (16) de thams cad bsogs pas mi gcig byung ngo (one from accumulating all, 12496); (17) dmag gi tshogs dpag tu med pa byung ngo (immeasurable military hosts arose, 12497); (18) summary: all deluded from non-existent delusion-basis (de las 'khrul gzhi med pa las byung ba'i phyir na, 12499).

Symbolic Narrative and Esoteric Encoding
Key grammatical constructions: (1) The vocative kye grogs po dag (O companions!, 12481) establishes narrative audience; (2) The concessive yang with negation: 'khrul pa mi mnga' yang (though not possessing delusion, 12482); (3) The ablative nas with source of delusion: nas 'khrul lo (deluded from..., 12484-12491); (4) The temporal dang with specification: dus nam sros pa dang (at time called Sros, 12486); (5) The compound formation: yangs pa can (Broad-land), mdzes ldan (Beautiful-abode), ling tog can (Top-knot-possessor); (6) The enumerative byung ngo (arose, 12493-12497) marking narrative progression; (7) The collective de thams cad bsogs pas (all that having accumulated, 12496); (8) The concluding 'khrul gzhi med pa (without delusion-basis, 12499).

[12478-12499] [CONTEXT]
Brda System and Esoteric Communication
The symbolic narrative employs brda (code/symbol) system of Dzogchen: (1) Each coordinate encodes philosophical content: yul (location) = basis, gnas (place) = manifestation, dus (time) = moment of non-recognition, lo (year) = cyclic condition, nyi ma (day) = wisdom-faculty, skar ma (star) = subtle condition, ming (name) = identity-fixation, rus (caste) = social conditioning, rogs mi (companions) = harmonious conditions, mi rgod pa (robbers) = afflictive forces, rgyab rten (supporters) = enabling conditions, rkun mo (thieves) = appropriating consciousness, bsogs pa (accumulation) = karmic formations, dmag gi tshogs (military hosts) = multiplying delusions; (2) Rang shar tantra provides narrative framework; (3) The method allows complex philosophy in accessible form.

[12478-12499] [CONCEPT]
Narrative as Philosophical Encoding and Groundlessness of Delusion
The core philosophical framework: (1) Symbolic narrative encodes delusion's process: Vajrasattva (primordial buddha) appears to become deluded in specific circumstances - representing how non-recognition occurs even within pure awareness; (2) Each symbolic element = stage in delusion: location = basis, place = manifestation, time = non-recognition moment, companions = conditions, robbers = afflictions, supporters = enabling factors, thieves = appropriation, military hosts = delusion's multiplication; (3) Fundamental insight: 'khrul gzhi med pa las byung ba'i phyir na (because arisen from non-existent delusion-basis, 12499) - delusion has no actual basis; (4) The narrative describes apparent process that, from recognition's perspective, never actually occurred; (5) The symbolic method communicates both apparent reality of delusion and its ultimate unreality simultaneously; (6) Tenth section will extensively present delusion modes and reversal through this brda (symbolic) methodology, transitioning from direct exposition to encoded narrative transmission.

[12478-12499] [PHILOLOGY]
Extended Analysis: The Ten-Stage Narrative Structure
The Vajrasattva delusion narrative follows systematic symbolic encoding: (1) Spatial coordinates (yul, gnas) establish ontological ground; (2) Temporal coordinates (dus, lo, nyi ma, skar ma) establish conditions of arising; (3) Identity coordinates (ming, rus) establish self-fixation; (4) Social coordinates (rogs mi, rgyab rten, rkun mo) establish relational conditions; (5) Conflict coordinates (mi rgod pa, dmag gi tshogs) establish karmic elaboration. The phrase 'khrul gzhi med pa (without delusion-basis) echoes throughout Dzogchen literature as the definitive statement of delusion's adventitiousness.

Spontaneous Presence Characteristics

**Five Spontaneous Presences:**
1. **Spontaneously present essence** (*ngo bo lhun grub*): not created
2. **Spontaneously present nature** (*rang bzhin lhun grub*): self-clear
3. **Spontaneously present compassion** (*thugs rje lhun grub*): self-manifesting
4. **Spontaneously present qualities** (*yon tan lhun grub*): complete
5. **Spontaneously present activities** (*phrin las lhun grub*): effortless

From *Rang shar*:
"Five spontaneous presences
Essence, nature, compassion
Qualities, activities
Fivefold complete"

**Not Created:**
Spontaneously present: not created by causes.
Not dependent on conditions.
Naturally arisen, naturally complete.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Spontaneously present
Not created causes
Not dependent conditions
Naturally arisen
Naturally complete
Not created thus"

**Self-Perfected:**
Self-perfected: complete in itself.
Not achieved through effort.
Not accomplished through practice.
Naturally perfect from beginning.

From *De nyid*:
"Self-perfected complete
Not achieved effort
Not accomplished practice
Naturally perfect
Beginning complete"
