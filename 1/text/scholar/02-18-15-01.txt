<context> This passage presents the stabilization phase of Dzogchen practice—the consolidation of recognition into unshakeable realization. The three immovabilities correspond to three gates (body, speech/wind, mind/vision), while the three stabilizations provide more detailed phenomenology of each. The "focused inert" (gtad pa'i 'bem) refers to concentrated fixation that must be transcended—the paradox of effortful non-effort. The "portal of the domain" (dbyings kyi go ra) terminology derives from Mahāyoga spatial metaphors for Dzogchen expanse. The passage reflects Longchenpa's systematic presentation of practice phases beyond initial recognition.

<concept>
• Three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum):
  - Body: free from activity fixation
  - Speech/wind: free from conditionality
  - Mind/vision: free from samsara-nirvana duality

• Three stabilizations (sdod pa gsum) detailed:
  - Body: activity non-abiding, limb extension-contraction ceased, activity established in ground
  - Wind: not going outward, not held inward, no going-coming
  - Vision: no flickering in light, no wavering in awareness, no trembling in form

• Ninefold schema:
  - Each gate has three degrees of stabilization
  - Progressive deepening from coarse to subtle
  - Culminating in four measures of body, speech, mind

: gzhi shes gsum (three ground knowledges): gzhi (ground), lam (path), 'bras bu (result). yid ches (confidence/faith): epistemic trust. phyir ldog (return): regression from realization.

<context> This passage integrates tantric empowerment theory (dbang bzhi) with Dzogchen stabilization practice. The four measures establish concrete criteria for progress: body measure through empowerment basis certainty, speech measure through empowerment path certainty, mind measure through empowerment result certainty, and non-return measure through irreversibility. The three ground knowledges parallel the classical Buddhist triad of ground-path-result but reconceived from Dzogchen's spontaneous perspective. The emphasis on "four visions arriving at measure" (snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa) as irreversible indicates the point of no return on the path.

<concept>
• Four measures (tshad bzhi):
  - Body: four empowerments' basis certainty
  - Speech: four empowerments' path certainty  
  - Mind: four empowerments' result certainty
  - Non-return: irreversible from liberation

• Four signs of body measure completion:
  - Four empowerments' basis obtained
  - Four signs: body light, speech melody, mind non-conceptual
  - Body karmic outflows exhausted
  - Spontaneous completion of realization

• Three ground knowledges (gzhi shes gsum):
  - Ground: original purity recognized
  - Path: meditation without separation
  - Result: confidence in attainment

<context> This passage establishes the relationship between exhaustion (zad pa) and spontaneous completion (lhun grub) as result-phase attainments. The rainbow body ('ja' lus) appears as the somatic signature of complete realization—the body dissolves into light leaving only hair and nails, or nothing at all. The distinction between delusory appearance ('khrul snang) and exhaustion-vision (chos zad pa'i snang ba) clarifies that exhaustion is not mere cessation but recognition of primordial purity. The four visions as definitive criteria provide measurable indicators of progress on the path.

<concept>
• Definitive meaning of exhaustion:
  - Not mere cessation but recognition
  - Natural self-liberation of phenomena
  - Spontaneous completion as result
  - Rainbow body as somatic proof

• Four visions as criteria:
  - Dharmatā vision: initial recognition
  - Increasing experience: maturation
  - Awareness at measure: completion
  - Exhaustion: final liberation

• Somatic transformation:
  - Body's karmic outflows exhausted
  - Sense faculties transformed
  - Vajra body attained
  - Spontaneously complete without practice

<context> This passage establishes recognition (ngo shes) as the cognitive foundation of Dzogchen practice. Unlike gradual paths that emphasize transformation, Dzogchen emphasizes recognition of what is already present. The four recognitions provide diagnostic tools for navigating the four visions: recognizing visions as self-display, recognizing awareness as the ground, recognizing mind's constructs, and recognizing exhaustion as perfection. The emphasis on "this life's body" (tshe 'di'i lus) reflects Nyingma assertions about attainability of full awakening without awaiting future lives.

<concept>
• Four recognitions (ngo shes bzhi):
  - Vision recognition: identifying visionary marks
  - Awareness recognition: knowing the knower
  - Mind recognition: distinguishing conceptual from non-conceptual
  - Exhaustion recognition: understanding dissolution

• Recognition functions:
  - Diagnostic: identifying path stages
  - Prognostic: predicting attainment
  - Therapeutic: correcting errors
  - Teleological: orienting toward goal

• Practice requirements:
  - Put into practice (nyams su len)
