Eighth and Ninth Grounds: Sequential Fruition
**Analysis:** This minimal structural passage presents the eighth ground (*brgyad pa*)—attainment of the Immovable Ground (*mi g.yo ba'i sa*)—and transitions to the Perfection of Excellent Qualities (*yon tan rdzogs pa*) as the ninth perfection. The structure follows the classical ten-ground (*sa bcu*) enumeration: each ground is marked by an ordinal (*brgyad pa*, *dgu pa*) followed by the specific attainment. The transitional particle *de nas* (thereafter/then) indicates sequential progression through the bodhisattva grounds.

**Analysis:** Line 5923: *brgyad pa mi g.yo ba'i sa thob pa'o*—"The eighth: attainment of the Immovable Ground." The construction employs the ordinal *brgyad pa* (eighth) with the ground name *mi g.yo ba'i sa* (Immovable Ground) in genitive relationship, followed by *thob pa* (attainment) with terminative *o*. The term *mi g.yo* (immovable/non-shifting) refers to the eighth ground where bodhisattvas achieve irreversibility (*phyir mi ldog pa*).

Line 5924: *de nas yon tan rdzogs pa ni*—"Thereafter, the Perfection of Excellent Qualities." The particle *de nas* marks temporal sequence, while *yon tan rdzogs pa* (perfection of excellent qualities) represents the ninth perfection. The emphatic *ni* isolates this as a major topical division.

**Analysis:** These lines belong to Chapter 18's presentation of the ten grounds (*sa bcu*) and ten perfections (*pha rol tu phyin pa bcu*), specifically marking the transition from the eighth to ninth stages. The Eighth Ground (*Acalā*) is called "Immovable" because bodhisattvas here attain irreversible realization—they cannot fall back into lower paths or worldly concerns. At this stage, they achieve: (1) cessation of all afflictive obscurations (*nyon sgrib*); (2) continuous meditative equipoise (*mnyam gzhag*); (3) ability to manifest infinite emanations (*sprul pa*). The "Perfection of Excellent Qualities" (*yon tan rdzogs pa*) refers to the ninth pāramitā—often identified as *bala-pāramitā* (power perfection) or *prabidhijñāna-pāramitā* (perfection of analytical knowledges). This pairing follows the Abhisamayālaṃkāra's structure where each ground corresponds to a specific perfection.

**Analysis:** The Eighth Ground represents a watershed in bodhisattva attainment—the transition from shared to uncommon path. Before this ground, bodhisattvas and śrāvakas share similar realizations of emptiness; at the Eighth Ground, bodhisattvas realize the non-duality of emptiness and compassion (*stong rnyid snying rje zung 'jug*), which śrāvakas do not achieve. The "immoveability" (*mi g.yo*) has two aspects: (1) immovable from wisdom—continuous realization without regression; (2) immovable in compassionate activity—unceasing benefit for beings. The Perfection of Excellent Qualities indicates that at this stage, all bodhisattva qualities (*yon tan*)—the ten powers (*stobs bcu*), four fearlessnesses (*mi 'jigs pa bzhi*), and eighteen distinctive qualities (*ma 'dres pa bco brgyad*)—become fully manifest. This perfection completes the sambhogakāya's qualities in preparation for the dharmakāya's full revelation at the tenth ground.
