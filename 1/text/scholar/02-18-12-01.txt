. Third vision: awareness arriving at measure (rig pa tshad phebs) preliminary and definition.

[5242-5245] <structure>
This opening section presents the preliminary signs (sngon 'gro'i rtags) of the third vision: cessation of outer vision (phyi snang zad pa), manifestation of half-bodies within spheres (thig le nang du sku phyed), and self-arising single bodies born of dharmatā direct perception (chos nyid mngon sum gyi sku gcig rang shar). The structure moves from cessation through partial manifestation to complete self-arising, following the Dzogchen pattern of dissolution and re-manifestation.

[5242-5245] <context>
The cessation of outer vision indicates the dissolution of ordinary perception as the third vision dawns. The half-bodies (sku phyed) represent intermediate visionary forms between ordinary appearance and complete Buddha-forms. The citation structure prepares for extensive scriptural validation from Thal 'gyur and Bstan bu (Demonstration Child) tantras, establishing the Nyingma authority for these advanced experiences.

[5242-5245] <philology>
The term snang zad (vision exhaustion/cessation) carries the technical sense of ordinary appearances dissolving into luminosity. The compound sku phyed (half-body) indicates partial manifestation—neither ordinary form nor complete deity body. The phrase chos nyid mngon sum (dharmatā direct perception) indicates non-conceptual recognition of reality. These terms require careful distinction from lower tantric experiences.

[5242-5245] <concept>
The phenomenology of third vision onset is paradoxical: outer vision ceases (apparent loss) while inner vision intensifies (actual gain). The concept of sprul pa'i dag pa (Emanation purification) indicates that Nirmanakaya obscurations are cleared, allowing Enjoyment Body manifestation. The self-arising (rang shar) nature of these forms indicates they are not mentally constructed but spontaneously present.

[5246-5253] <structure>
The main section begins with ornament markers indicating the third vision proper, then presents the definition (nges tshig) of awareness arriving at measure. The structure describes: (1) transformation into five Fathers and five Mothers, (2) Enjoyment Body's wisdom reaching measure, (3) vision dawning with heaps and mandala complete, (4) peripheral walls and sovereign hosts, (5) arisen through Reality Body's purification. This fivefold presentation follows the Nyingma systematic taxonomy.

[5246-5253] <context>
The transformation into five Fathers (yab) and five Mothers (yum) indicates the complete manifestation of the five Buddha families in union, representing the integration of method and wisdom. The Enjoyment Body (longs sku) reaching its measure indicates that Sambhogakaya qualities are fully manifest. The mandala complete with peripheral walls (mu khyud) and sovereign hosts (gtsos 'khor) represents the complete visionary universe. This reflects the mature phase of thod rgal practice.

[5246-5253] <philology>
The term rigs lnga (five families) refers to the Buddha categories: Vajra, Tathāgata, Jewel, Lotus, Karma. The compound yab yum (Father-Mother) indicates the union of method (thabs) and wisdom (shes rab). The phrase longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku (Enjoyment Body) carries its technical sense as the body enjoyed by Bodhisattvas. The term chos sku (Reality Body/Dharmakaya) indicates the ultimate essence from which visions arise. The architectural terms (pho brang palace, mu khyud walls, gtsos 'khor hosts) describe the mandala structure.

[5246-5253] <concept>
The philosophical architecture here is comprehensive: the five families represent the transformation of five poisons into five wisdoms; Father-Mother union represents the non-duality of appearance and emptiness; Enjoyment Body represents the communicative dimension of enlightenment; Reality Body represents the ultimate nature. The concept of tshad phebs (arriving at measure) indicates that awareness has reached its full capacity—nothing more can be added.

[5254-5260] <structure>
This subsection presents the signs (rtags) that preliminary practices are complete: bodily actions and activities shall not arise again (lus kyi bya ba las kyi 'brel tshad mi 'char), visions dawn through reaching vital points (gnad du phyin pas snang ba), antidotes purify defilements (gnyen pos nyon mongs sbyang), causal fruit of separation (bral 'bras), and wisdom's self-existing resonance (ye shes rang sgra). The structure moves from preliminary completion through causal analysis to ultimate wisdom.

[5254-5260] <context>
The signs indicate irreversible progress: when preliminary bodily actions no longer arise, the practitioner has transcended ordinary physical existence. The "vital points" (gnad) refer to the crucial junctures in the subtle body where wisdom manifests. The concept of bral 'bras (fruit of separation) indicates liberation through recognizing non-duality rather than destroying defilements. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of self-liberation (rang grol).

[5254-5260] <philology>
The term 'brel tshad (connection measure) refers to karmic linkages that normally perpetuate existence. The compound gnyen po (antidote/remedy) carries the technical Abhidharma sense of specific counteragents for afflictions. The phrase bral 'bras (separation fruit) distinguishes Dzogchen liberation from ordinary Buddhist paths—liberation is separation from delusion, not destruction of it. The term rang sgra (self-resonance/self-sound) indicates wisdom's spontaneous expression.

[5254-5260] <concept>
The epistemology here is nuanced: visions arise not from being produced (bsgrubs nas mi 'ong) but through purification's force (sbyangs pa'i nus pas). This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that wisdom is not created but revealed. The concept of causal nexus (rgyu 'bras) is transcended—there is no actual purifier and purified, just the appearance of purification. The self-existing resonance appears spontaneously (rang gsang) without deliberate effort.

[5261-5268] <structure>
The section concludes with two scriptural citations: first from Thal 'gyur describing Enjoyment Body's marks and examples manifesting from rainbow lights, then from Bstan bu enumerating the numerical progression of bodies (six, ten, five-three). The structure validates the preceding exposition through canonical authority.

[5261-5268] <context>
The citation from Thal 'gyur establishes that Enjoyment Body qualities appear from indeterminate rainbow lights ('ja' tshon khra bo)—indicating that form arises from formless luminosity. The Bstan bu citation's numerical enumeration (drug, bcu, lnga gsum) refers to specific mandala configurations: six realms, ten directions, and five-three families. This reflects the Nyingma integration of scriptural authority with systematic presentation.

[5261-5268] <philology>
The term mtshan dpe (marks and examples) refers to the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a Buddha. The compound 'ja' tshon khra bo (rainbow lights of indeterminate hue) describes the luminous ground from which visions arise. The phrase yab yum lnga (five Fathers and Mothers) indicates the complete mandala of five Buddha couples. The numerical terms require precise technical understanding.

[5261-5268] <concept>
The philosophical synthesis here is profound: ultimate reality (indeterminate rainbow lights) manifests as apparent form (Enjoyment Body with marks and examples) without losing its essential nature. The concept of snang ba tshad phebs (vision arriving at measure) indicates that appearance has reached its full expression—nothing more can be added or subtracted. The numerical completeness (six, ten, five-three) suggests that all possible manifestations are now present.
