Universal Acceptability Ground Refutation
**Analysis:** Lines 10693-10715 present the refutation of the fifth extreme view: asserting ground as capable of accepting anything as commitment (cir yang khas blang du btub pa). Line 10694 presents the assertion: because awareness essence is without direction and appears everywhere (rig pa'i ngo bo la phyogs med kun tu shar bas), capable of accepting anything (cir yang khas len pa). Lines 10695-10715 present the refutation: (1) does this accepting exist in ground or not? (cir yang khas len pa de gzhi de las gnas pa khas len nam mi gnas pa khas len), (2) if the first, permanent and impermanent would be simultaneously established (rtag dngos mi rtag dngos gnyis lhan cig grub par thal), because impermanent appears to merely exist (mi rtag pa snang tsam du gnas pa'i phyir), (3) even if impermanent established, permanent not established (mi rtag pa grub kyang rtag dngos ma grub), contradicts capable of accepting anything (cir yang khas len du btub pa nyams so), (4) similarly, cyclic existence would be effortlessly liberated and liberation would reverse ('khor ba 'bad med du grol ba dang grol ba rnams ldog pa thal), (5) if second (not existing in ground), accepting rabbit horns and son of barren woman as samsara-nirvana has endless faults (ri bong gi rwa dang mo gsham gyi bus 'khor 'das byas pa yang khas len pa la sogs pa thug pa med pa'i skyon). Lines 10707-10715 cite the tantra: teacher spoke before of those with acceptances (ston pa nyid kyis sngar gsungs pa), these are merely directional imputations (phyogs kyi 'phen pa tsam), establishing all as existent ('thams cad yin ngor bsgrub pa'i phyir), producing endless faults (thug pa med pa'i skyon 'gyur).

Presentation of Universal Assertion Position

**Analysis:** Lines 10693-10706 present and begin refuting the fifth position ('dod pa): the ground's awareness-nature (rig pa'i ngo bo) manifests universally (kun tu shar) without partiality (phyogs med), therefore it asserts/accepts (khas len) anything whatsoever (cir yang). The structure follows: position statement (lines 10693-10694), refutation marker (line 10695), and initial refutation showing that universal assertion leads to contradictory consequences. This position attempts to resolve previous problems by positing that the ground, being unlimited awareness, naturally encompasses all possible positions without contradiction.

Universal Assertion and Dialectical Negation

**Analysis:** The passage employs the phrase cir yang khas len pa (asserts/accepts anything whatsoever), with khas len indicating philosophical assertion or acceptance of a position. Line 10696 uses the demonstrative de (that) to refer back to the position. The disjunctive construction nam... (or...) introduces alternatives at lines 10697-10698. The term dngos (entity/substance) appears in the compounds rtag dngos (permanent entity) and mi rtag dngos (impermanent entity) at line 10699. The phrase lhan cig grub par thal te (entails arising together) marks the consequence of simultaneous existence of contradictory properties. The verb nyams so (is damaged/defeated) at line 10702 indicates logical refutation.

Universalism vs. Specificity in Ground Theory

**Analysis:** This position engages with the perennial philosophical tension between universalism (ground encompasses everything) and specificity (ground has determinate characteristics). Similar tensions appear in debates about God in Western theology, Brahman in Advaita Vedanta, and the dharmadhatu in Mahayana Buddhism. The position attempts to avoid the charge of limitation by asserting that the ground, being pure awareness, encompasses all possible positions. However, as the refutation demonstrates, this leads to the unacceptable consequence that contradictory positions become simultaneously true, undermining rational discourse itself.

Universal Assertion and the Law of Non-Contradiction

**Analysis:** The refutation demonstrates that universal assertion (cir yang khas len pa) violates the law of non-contradiction. If the ground accepts both permanent and impermanent entities simultaneously (rtag dngos mi rtag dngos gnyis lhan cig grub), this creates logical incoherence. The passage examines two alternatives: (1) If the ground accepts abiding (gnas pa), both permanence and impermanence must simultaneously exist; (2) If the ground accepts non-abiding (mi gnas pa), all distinctions collapse. Both alternatives lead to: (a) Liberation without effort; (b) Regression of the liberated; (c) The consequence that even absurd entities (rabbit horns, barren woman's son) would be accepted as establishing samsara and nirvana.

Canonical Citation on Universal Assertion

**Analysis:** Lines 10707-10715 present a citation from the source text concerning the problem of universal assertion. The structure follows: source marker (line 10707), seven lines of verse (lines 10708-10714), and closing zhes so (line 10715). The verse emphasizes that the Buddha previously taught (sngar gsungs pa) that those who assert all positions (khas len rnams dang ldan par) fall into the error of infinite regress (thug pa med pa'i skyon). The verse explains that this is because they attempt to establish everything (thams cad yin ngor bsgrub pa) as merely the projection of partiality (phyogs kyi 'phen pa tsam).

[10707-10715] <philology>
Projective Terminology and Infinite Regress

**Analysis:** The verse employs key terminology: khas len rnams (assertions/positions), phyogs kyi 'phen pa (projection of partiality/directional casting), and thug pa med pa (without end/infinite). The phrase yin ngor bsgrub pa (establishing as being/existent) at line 10711 indicates ontological assertion. The verb 'phen pa (throw/project/cast) suggests that positions are merely projections of partiality rather than authentic reality. The phrase sngar gsungs pa (previously taught) at line 10709 and sngar dang mtshungs (equal to before) at line 10714 indicate continuity with previous arguments. The term skyon (fault/defect) marks the error being identified.

Critique of Philosophical Universalism

**Analysis:** This citation engages with critiques of philosophical positions that attempt to encompass everything within a single framework. In Buddhist doxography, this critique targets systems like the Sarvastivada (All-Exists School) and certain formulations of Tathagatagarbha thought that posit universal presence of Buddha-nature. The specific concern with thug pa med pa (infinite regress without end) reflects Buddhist logical analysis: if all positions are equally valid, no position can be established definitively, leading to epistemological and soteriological paralysis. The passage positions Dzogchen as transcending all partial positions without falling into the error of accepting them all.

Partiality as Projective Error

**Analysis:** The verse articulates a key Dzogchen concept: all philosophical positions (phyogs) are merely projections ('phen pa) of partiality. This means: (1) **Conceptual Limitation:** Any determinate position is limited by the conceptual framework that formulates it; (2) **Partial Truth:** All positions contain partial truth but none contains the whole truth; (3) **Projective Nature:** Positions are not discoveries of objective reality but projections of subjective conceptualization; (4) **Infinite Regress:** Attempting to establish all positions as equally valid leads to thug pa med pa—infinite regress without resolution. This analysis supports Longchenpa's eventual presentation of the ground as beyond all positions while being the basis for their possibility.

Variegated Ground Refutation
**Analysis:** Lines 10716-10741 present the refutation of the sixth extreme view: asserting ground as variegated/manifold (sna tshogs su 'dod pa/khra bor 'dod pa). Line 10717 presents the assertion: because essence appears everywhere (ngo bo kun tu shar bas), mode of appearance appears variegated manifold (snang tshul khra bo sna tshogs shar bar 'dod). Lines 10718-10741 present the refutation: (1) does this manifoldness exist in external appearance (phyi snang ba), internal consciousness (nang shes pa), or both combined (de gnyis tshogs pa)? (2) if first, fault that the single ground also appears manifold externally (gzhi gcig po de yang sna tshogs su phyir shar ba'i skyon), (3) if second, consciousness is momentary (shes pa skad cig ma), so ground would be momentary (gzhi skad cig mar thal), consciousness involves conceptual apprehension (shes pa snyam byed rtogs pa), so ground would be multiple like that (gzhi yang der thal), consciousness is afflicted and condition-controlled (shes pa nyon mongs rkyen dbang can), so ground would be too (gzhi yang der thal), (4) if third, ground would be external-internal (gzhi phyi nang du thal), ground would be perceiver-perceived (gzhi gzung 'dzin du thal), ground would be the six collections to be abandoned (gzhi tshogs drug spang bya phyogs gcig par thal), (5) also ground as single space does not make sense (yang gzhi zhes dbyings gcig tu mi 'thad), because it is a collection of many (mang po tshogs pa yin pa'i phyir). Lines 10733-10741 cite the Klong drug tantra: teacher spoke variegated above (ston pas gong du khra bor gsungs), also not agreeing with partiality ('di yang phyogs dang mi 'thad pas), essence that appears ('gang gi ngo bo de snang ba), effect different meaning same ('bras bu tha dad don de mtshungs), corrupted by word of many (mang ba'i sgra yis nyams pa'i phyir)—these are knowable objects (shes bya ma lags sam).

Presentation of Variegated Appearance Position

**Analysis:** Lines 10716-10723 present the sixth position ('dod pa): the essence manifests universally (kun tu shar), therefore the manner of appearance manifests as variegated and manifold (khra bo sna tshogs). The structure follows: position identifier (drug pa la'ang khas blangs brjod pa ni), essence characterization (universal manifestation), and appearance characterization (variegated multiplicity). This position begins a refutation examining three alternatives: whether manifold appearance is external appearance (phyi snang ba), internal cognition (nang shes pa), or their aggregation (tshogs pa).

Appearance Vocabulary and Alternative Formulation

**Analysis:** The passage employs appearance terminology: khra bo (variegated/multicolored), sna tshogs (manifold/various), snang tshul (manner of appearance), and shar (manifest/arise). The term khas blangs (acceptance/assertion) at line 10716 parallels khas len. Line 10718 marks the transition to refutation with gnyis pa de dgag pa ni. The disjunctive dam (or) introduces three alternatives at lines 10719-10721. The demonstrative de (that) at line 10722 refers to the ground. The phrase sna tshogs su phyir shar ba (manifests as manifold) at line 10723 marks the consequence being analyzed. The connective la serves multiple functions marking location and logical connection.

Appearance Theory in Buddhist Epistemology

**Analysis:** This position engages with Buddhist theories of appearance (snang ba) and their relationship to cognition (shes pa). The three alternatives presented—external, internal, or aggregated—reflect classical Buddhist options for explaining the nature of appearance: (1) **External Realism:** Appearances exist objectively outside mind; (2) **Idealism:** Appearances are purely internal to cognition; (3) **Aggregation Theory:** Appearances arise from the interaction of external and internal factors. Longchenpa's analysis will demonstrate that all three options lead to problems when applied to the ground, preparing for his own presentation of appearance as the spontaneous manifestation of ground without separation from it.

[10716-10721] <concept>
Variegated Appearance and Ground Multiplicity

**Analysis:** The position posits that universal manifestation (kun tu shar) in essence necessarily produces variegated appearance (khra bo sna tshogs) in manifestation. This creates a potential problem: if appearance is truly manifold (sna tshogs), does this make the ground itself manifold? The refutation examines this by analyzing the three possible locations of manifold appearance: (1) If external, the ground itself becomes manifold (line 10723); (2) If internal, the ground becomes momentary and multiple like mind; (3) If aggregated, the ground becomes dualistic. All options violate the non-dual nature of ground. This analysis demonstrates that appearance cannot be explained as something other than ground without creating dualistic consequences.
