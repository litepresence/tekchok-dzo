[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the epistemological foundations of Dzogchen practice—certain knowledge (nges shes) of appearance-emptiness inseparability. The five aspects provide a comprehensive framework: (1) characteristics—knowing what to recognize, (2) confidence—trust in the path, (3) non-confusion—freedom from error, (4) certain knowledge—definite understanding, (5) mind's object—cognitive domain. The verse citation grounds the presentation in canonical authority, emphasizing luminous-clear self-arisen wisdom as the nature of mind.

[CONCEPT]
• Five aspects of recognition:
  - Characteristics: defining marks of stages
  - Confidence: epistemic trust in path
  - Non-confusion: error-free discrimination
  - Certain knowledge: definite understanding
  - Mind's object: cognitive domain mastery

• Appearance-emptiness inseparability:
  - Not first appearance then emptiness
  - Simultaneous co-emergence
  - Naturally pure from beginning
  - Self-arisen wisdom as basis

• Teleological implications:
  - Three thousand worlds as domain
  - Nectar of immortality
  - Mind's stains purified
  - Perfect buddhahood attained

: sbubs bor ba (abandoned retreat center): different progression. 'khrul snang 'gags (delusory appearance ceases): prerequisite for higher bhūmis. tshom bu'i snang ba (sphere vision): concentrated luminosity.

[CONTEXT] This passage represents Longchenpa's definitive statement on the relationship between Dzogchen and the bodhisattva path. The assertion that bhūmis are not external locations but stages recognized within a single individual's truth-seeing encapsulates Dzogchen's "sudden" approach. The enumeration of ten bhūmis with specific phenomenological markers (joy, self-display recognition, light vision, etc.) demonstrates how classical Mahāyāna categories are reinterpreted through Dzogchen's lens of direct recognition. The distinction between those maintaining and abandoning retreat reflects practical considerations while affirming that all bhūmis complete in original recognition.

[CONCEPT]
• Bhūmis as recognition stages:
  - Not external locations
  - Not sequential lifetimes
  - All present in single truth-seeing
  - Completion in original recognition

• Ten bhūmi phenomenology:
  1. Joy arises at truth-seeing
  2. Self-display recognized
  3. Light familiarization
  4. Wisdom vision
  5. Afflictions naturally purified
  6. Body from light ashes
  7. Afflictions distanced
  8. Non-moving stability
  9. Qualities complete
  10. Cloud-like dharmas

• Dzogchen direct approach:
  - All stages in single recognition
  - No gradual cultivation required
  - Original purity as basis
  - Spontaneous completion as result

: gzhi (ground), lam (path), 'bras bu (result): classical Buddhist triad. sems nyid chos sku (mind itself dharmakāya): mind's nature is dharmakāya—not transformation but recognition.

[CONTEXT] This passage concludes the detailed analysis of Tögal practice with the mind's three immovabilities. The progression from body (physical) to wind (energetic) to mind (cognitive) represents the standard subtle-body hierarchy in tantric Buddhism. The verse citation emphasizes mind-itself (sems nyid) as dharmakāya—a key Dzogchen formulation distinguishing between ordinary mind (sems) and mind-nature (sems nyid). The integration of ground-path-result (gzhi-lam-'bras bu) provides the overarching framework for understanding Dzogchen as both transcendence of and completion within Buddhist soteriology.

[CONCEPT]
• Mind's three immovabilities:
  - Without thought: non-conceptual presence
  - Without distraction: continuous awareness
  - Without alteration: spontaneous stability
  - Culmination of body-wind-mind progression

• Mind-itself as dharmakāya:
  - Not transformation of mind into dharmakāya
  - Recognition of mind's nature as always dharmakāya
  - Luminous-clear emptiness
  - Wisdom-awareness union

• Ground-path-result integration:
  - Ground: original purity
  - Path: recognition and stabilization
  - Result: spontaneous perfection
  - Three times equality
