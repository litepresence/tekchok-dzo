. Practice chamber preparation: directional orientation and solar illumination.

[9404-9404] <structure>
This brief section presents the first of four aspects regarding the practice chamber (sgrub khang): directional determination (phyogs nges pa), solar apertures (nyi ma'i 'od 'jug), pure crystal preparation (shel dkar dri ma med), and mirror blessing (me long byin rlabs). The structure establishes the material foundation for thod rgal practice, moving from spatial orientation through light manipulation to blessing transmission.

The citation from mNgon par bshad pa'i rgyud (Tantra of Clear Introduction) establishes scriptural authority for these material preparations. The practice chamber represents the external support (rten) that enables internal realization. The specification of sunbeams (nyi zer) reflects the Nyingma understanding that natural light serves as the medium for visionary experience. The "mirror that clarifies" (gsal byed me long) refers to the crystal or mirror used to concentrate and direct light.

The term sgrub khang (practice chamber/accomplishment house) carries its technical sense as a specially prepared space for meditation. The compound phyogs nges (direction determined) refers to the tantric practice of aligning practice spaces with cardinal directions or specific auspicious orientations. The phrase shel dkar (white crystal/pure crystal) indicates the clear medium used for light manipulation. The verb gsal byed (clarifies/makes clear) indicates the transformative function of the mirror.

The philosophical architecture here reflects the Dzogchen integration of external conditions and internal realization: the practice chamber is not merely a physical space but a "field of merit" (bsod nams zhing) where the external supports the internal. The emphasis on purity (dri ma med) indicates that the practice environment mirrors the primordial purity (ka dag) to be recognized. The blessing of Vajrasattva (rdo rje sems dpa'i byin rlabs) indicates that material preparations must be consecrated to become effective supports for realization.
