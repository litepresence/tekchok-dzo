Guhyasamaja and Three Vajra System
**Analysis:** This passage presents the syllable generation system following Guhyasamaja (gsang ba 'dus pa) architecture:

**Tibetan Structure:**
- OM generates vajra body (sku rdo rje)
- AH generates vajra speech (gsung rdo rje)
- HUM generates vajra mind (thugs rdo rje)

This corresponds to the three mysteries (gsang ba gsum) of body, speech, and mind, and their purification into three vajras.

**Guhyasamaja Correspondence:**
- OM: Generates vajra body - located at root (rtsa ba)
- AH: Generates vajra speech - located at waist (rked pa)
- HUM: Generates vajra mind - located at tip (rtsa mo)

This creates sku gsum (three kayas) in the subtle body vajra.

Causative Constructions and Instrumental Chains
**Analysis:**

**Morphological Analysis:**
- "Bskyed pa" (བསྐྱེད་པ་) - causative of skyed (to generate): "causes to arise"
- "Byas pa" (བྱེད་པ་) - causative of gyur (to become): "causes to become"  
- "Sbyar ba" (སྤྱོད་པ་) - causative of 'phrod (to join): "causes to join"

**Instrumental Chain:**
- "om gyis rdo rjer bskyed pa ni" = "by means of OM, producing vajra"
- The particle *gyis* (instrumental) indicates the means
- The emphatic *ni* marks the result

**Technical Vocabulary:**
- *Rdo rje* (རྡོ་རྗེ་) - vajra, diamond, thunderbolt
- *Sku gsung thugs* (སྐུ་གསུང་ཐུགས་) - body, speech, mind (three secrets)

Guhyasamaja Three Vajra System
**Analysis:**

**Three Secrets (Gsang Ba Gsum):**
1. Body secret (sku gsang) - vajra body
2. Speech secret (gsung gsang) - vajra speech  
3. Mind secret (thugs gsang) - vajra mind

**Subtle Body Correspondence:**
- OM: *Sku rdo rje* at rtsa ba (root)
- AH: *Gsung rdo rje* at rked pa (waist)
- HUM: *Thugs rdo rje* at rtsa mo (tip)

**Kaya Generation:**
- *Sku gsum* (three kayas) are generated through these syllables
- This creates the subtle body vajra
- The practitioner identifies with these vajra principles

Animal Posture Terminology
**Analysis:**

**Animal Metaphor Vocabulary:**
- "Stag mo'i 'gyur stangs" (tigress posture): Vigorous containment
- "Seng ge'i 'gying tshugs" (lion posture): Majestic stability
- "'Jag ma'i 'phyur stangs" (jackal posture): Flexible adaptation
- "Rtsa gnad kyi 'khor lo" (channel essential wheel): Complete rotation

**Grammatical Analysis:**
- The particle "ni" defines function: "stag mo ni bshang lam drag tu bsdams pas" (the tigress [posture] forcefully restrains the lower gate)
- The causative "skyed" indicates generation

**Postural Functions:**
- Tigress: Controls lower energy gates
- Lion: Maintains stability and majesty
- Jackal: Allows flexible movement
- Channel wheel: Integrates energy flow

This completes the syllable-generation and postural system for generating the vajra body in practice.
