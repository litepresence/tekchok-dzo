# Second and Third Wisdom Lamps: Appearances as Light-Ray Continuums
**Analysis:** This passage presents the second (*gnyis pa*) and third (*gsum pa*) wisdom lamps with their characteristic appearances. The second lamp addresses appearances (*snang ba*) as continuums of light-rays (*'od kyi zer thag*), manifesting five qualities: subtle (*phra ba*), moving (*'gul ba*), wriggling (*'phrig pa*), flickering (*ltem pa*), and blazing (*mer ba*). The third lamp concerns appearances dawning within the bindu's circle (*thig le'i mu khyud*), producing upright-standing appearances (*gyen 'greng*) and spokes (*rtsibs*) radiating eastward and in other directions. This establishes the progression from continuum (second) to center-periphery structure (third).

**Analysis:** The five qualities of appearance employ simple adjectival forms with continuative *dang*: *phra ba dang* (subtle and), *'gul ba dang* (moving and), *'phrig pa dang* (wriggling and), *ltem pa dang* (flickering and), *mer bar yang snang ba* (blazing also appear). The term *zer thag* (ray-thread) combines *zer* (ray) with *thag* (thread/continuum), indicating both radiance and continuity. The verb *'char* (to dawn/arise) appears in *'char ro* (dawns), indicating spontaneous manifestation rather than constructed appearance. The spatial terms *gyen 'greng* (upright standing) and *rtsibs* (spokes, as of a wheel) create a maṇḍala-like structure. The emphatic *yang* (also/even) in *yang 'char* indicates additional manifestations beyond the primary ones.

**Analysis:** These passages describe the visionary appearances (*snang ba*) associated with the second and third wisdom lamps in *rDzogs chen* practice. The five qualities—subtle, moving, wriggling, flickering, blazing—represent progressive intensification of luminous manifestation, from nearly imperceptible to brilliant radiance. The "upright standing" (*gyen 'greng*) appearances and directional "spokes" (*rtsibs*) reference the *thig le* (bindu) imagery found in *Mahāyoga* and *Atiyoga* tantras, wherein the bindu manifests as a luminous sphere with radiating light. This visionary physiology derives from the *Thalgyur* and *Mu tig phreng ba* tantras, describing how wisdom manifests visually in advanced practice.

**Analysis:** The five appearance qualities represent the *mngon rtogs* (clear realization) stages of the wisdom lamps: (1) *phra ba* (subtle)—barely perceptible luminosity; (2) *'gul ba* (moving)—shifting, dynamic light; (3) *'phrig pa* (wriggling)—vibratory, pulsating radiance; (4) *ltem pa* (flickering)—flashing, intermittent brilliance; (5) *mer ba* (blazing)—steady, intense illumination. This progression mirrors the *sbyangs gsum* (three purifications) of wind-energy. The upright-standing appearances and spokes represent the *gnas pa* (abiding) and *rtsol ba* (emission) phases of bindu manifestation—contracted and expanded states of luminosity. These appearances are not hallucinations but the natural *rang snang* (self-appearance) of wisdom when recognized.

# Third Division: The Three Self-Ripened Result Bindus
**Analysis:** This section presents the third (*gsum pa*) division on the bindus (*thig le*) of self-ripened result (*'bras bu rang smin pa*). The structure follows: (1) Source—sun-moon mouth-union (*nyi zla kha sbyor*); (2) Enumeration—three bindus; (3) Listing—bindu of ripened lights, bindu of ripened pristine cognition, bindu of ripened awareness; (4) Nature—upright-standing, clear like rainbow; (5) Result—accustomance leads to seeing appearances. This establishes the *smin gsum* (three ripenings) framework: lights (*'od*), pristine cognition (*ye shes*), and awareness (*rig pa*) as progressive maturations of essence.

[19427-19440] <philology>
**Analysis:** The phrase *'bras bu rang smin pa'i thig le* employs the genitive chain: result (*'bras bu*) + self-ripened (*rang smin pa*) + bindu (*thig le*). The term *rang smin* (self-ripened) indicates natural maturation without external intervention, distinct from *smin byed* (ripening agent). The enumerative *ste* following *gsum* introduces the threefold list. Each bindu uses the genitive: *'od rnam smin pa'i thig le* (bindu of lights' ripening), *ye shes smin pa'i thig le* (bindu of pristine cognition's ripening), *rig pa smin pa'i thig le* (bindu of awareness's ripening). The verb *'greng* (to stand upright) in *'greng bar gnas* (abides standing) indicates the bindu's natural posture. The simile *'ja' tshon bzhin* (like a rainbow) employs the terminative *bzhin* for comparison. The conditional *goms na* (if accustomed) with *la* marks the result of practice.

**Analysis:** This passage presents the *thig le gsum* (three bindus) of natural maturation found in *sNying thig* and *Thalgyur* tantras. The sun-moon mouth-union (*nyi zla kha sbyor*) refers to the union of white (moon/male) and red (sun/female) essences in the heart center, producing the bindus. The three bindus represent progressive recognition: (1) lights (*'od*)—luminous display; (2) pristine cognition (*ye shes*)—knowing quality; (3) awareness (*rig pa*)—recognition of nature. The "upright standing" posture and rainbow-like appearance reference the *gsang sgron* (secret lamp) physiology wherein bindus appear as luminous spheres in the central channel. The rainbow simile (*'ja' tshon*) indicates both clarity and insubstantiality—vivid yet empty.

[19427-19440] <concept>
**Analysis:** The three self-ripened bindus represent the *ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje* (essence, nature, compassion) triad in its manifested form: (1) Bindu of ripened lights (*'od rnam smin pa'i thig le*) = essence (*ngo bo*) = emptiness (*stong pa*) appearing as luminosity; (2) Bindu of ripened pristine cognition (*ye shes smin pa'i thig le*) = nature (*rang bzhin*) = clarity (*gsal ba*) as knowing; (3) Bindu of ripened awareness (*rig pa smin pa'i thig le*) = compassion (*thugs rje*) = unobstructed display (*ma 'gag rol pa*). The progression from lights to awareness represents the *smin lam* (ripening path)—from appearance to recognition. "Accustomed to this" (*'di la goms*) refers to *goms pa* (familiarization)—the progressive stabilization of recognition through repeated practice. "Appearances also seen" (*snang ba yang mthong*) indicates that through this recognition, all appearances become wisdom-display.
