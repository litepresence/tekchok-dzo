. Three transferences: clear-light, illusory-body, and body-speech.

[3307-3316] <structure>
This section presents the three types of consciousness transference (pho ba) organized by practitioner capacity: (1) great transference through clear-light ('od gsal pho ba che ba), (2) medium transference through illusory-body (sgyu lus pho ba 'bring ba), (3) finally body-speech transference (lus ngag pho ba tha ma). The structure distinguishes three capacities (dbang po gsum) of transference-doers rather than three methods—indicating that the method adapts to capacity. The progression moves from the highest (clear-light recognition) through intermediate (illusory-body mastery) to conventional (body-speech channels).

Transference represents the esoteric method for directing consciousness at death to achieve liberation or favorable rebirth. The citation from Thal 'gyur establishes scriptural authority: "Three aspect transference types / By sense distinction / Clear-light and illusory-body and / Upon finally body-speech mind." The three transference types reflect different levels of accomplishment: those who have mastered clear-light transference to dharmadhātu, those who can transfer to illusory-body in bardo, and those who must rely on conventional body-speech methods. This reflects the Nyingma graduated approach to death practices.

The term pho ba (transference) carries its technical tantric sense of ejecting or transferring consciousness at death. The compound 'od gsal (clear-light) refers to the ultimate nature of mind manifest at death. The term sgyu lus (illusory body/māyākāya) indicates the subtle body that continues after physical death. The phrase tshangs bu (Brahma-aperture) refers to the crown aperture where consciousness exits for liberation. The verb 'phang (eject/project) indicates the active process of directing consciousness. The particle las indicates the source or basis of transference.

The philosophical architecture of transference reflects the Dzogchen understanding of death as opportunity: if clear-light is recognized, consciousness dissolves into dharmadhātu (ultimate liberation); if illusory-body is mastered, consciousness projects into bardo deity-form (intermediate liberation); if neither, conventional methods eject consciousness to pure realms (gradual liberation). The concept of pho ba demonstrates that Dzogchen accommodates different capacities—ultimate recognition for the highest, skillful means for others. The distinction between actual transference (dngos) and actual-not (dngos min) indicates different levels of mastery.

. Body-speech transference: actual and actual-not methods.

[3317-3336] <structure>
This subsection elaborates the body-speech transference, presenting two divisions: actual transference (dngos su pho ba) and actual-not transference (dngos min pho ba). The actual method depends on channels and winds (rtsa rlung), while the actual-not depends on mind focus only (yid la gtad pa tsam). The structure presents the Thal 'gyur citation validating these methods, followed by detailed explanation of each approach.

[3317-3336] <context>
The body-speech transference represents the most accessible method for practitioners without advanced realization. The citation "Two aspect body-speech transference / Actual transference and actual-not" establishes scriptural basis. The actual method involves training with winds, sounds (sgra), and illusion-skills (sgyu rtsol)—indicating the use of subtle body practices. The actual-not method demonstrates that even without full mastery of winds, focused intention can direct consciousness. This reflects the Nyingma compassionate teaching that liberation is possible for all capacities.

[3317-3336] <philology>
The term dngos su (actual/truly) indicates authentic, complete transference as opposed to partial or preparatory practice. The compound rtsa rlung (channel-wind) refers to the subtle body system through which consciousness moves. The phrase sgra rtsol (sound craft) indicates the use of vocal techniques. The term sgyu rtsol (illusion-skill) refers to techniques for manipulating perception. The particle tsam (only/merely) in yid la gtad pa tsam indicates that even mental focus alone, without full wind mastery, can be effective.

[3317-3336] <concept>
The soteriology of transference is inclusive: even those without advanced realization can achieve liberation or favorable rebirth through these methods. The concept of 'byung ba bzhi nang gi mthun pa (internal harmony of four elements) indicates that transference requires harmonizing the elements within the body. The distinction between actual and actual-not reflects the reality that capacities vary—some can master the full technique, others must rely on simpler methods. Both are valid paths within the Dzogchen framework.
