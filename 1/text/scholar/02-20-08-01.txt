. First intention: mountain's general meaning—luminosity without transfer or change.

[9223-9229] <structure>
This section initiates the fivefold taxonomy of thod rgal (direct transcendence) intentions, beginning with the "mountain's general meaning" (ri bo spyi don). The structure presents a graduated soteriology where the essence of Great Perfection awareness manifests differently according to three sense-faculty capacities (dbang po gsum). For each capacity, view (lta ba), intention (dgongs pa), conduct (spyod pa), and fruit ('bras bu) are delineated, yielding twelve portions (cha bcu gnyis) total.

[9223-9238] <philology>
The term ri bo (mountain) metaphorically indicates stability, immovability, and prominence—the qualities of this initial intention. The compound 'pho 'gyur med (without transfer or change) employs double negation to emphasize the absolute stability of luminosity. The phrase dbyings ye gnyis med (space and wisdom non-dual) uses the technical Dzogchen vocabulary for the inseparability of emptiness and cognizance. The citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs (Lion Power-Perfect) tantra establishes scriptural authority for this specific fivefold schema.

[9223-9238] <context>
The five intentions represent distinct modalities of thod rgal practice, each corresponding to different aspects of the subtle body and different stages of visionary experience. The "mountain" intention focuses on the stability of awareness, the "wisdom filling" on empowerment, the "bindu range-penetration" on energetic channels, the "sun-moon equal gap" on balancing dualities, and the "ocean expanse-penetration" on universal pervasiveness. This taxonomy reflects the Nyingma systematization of Atiyoga practices into coherent pedagogical frameworks.

[9223-9238] <concept>
The epistemology presented here is phenomenologically sophisticated: the same ultimate reality (Great Perfection awareness) is realized differently according to practitioner capacity, yet all capacities lead to the same fruition. This reflects the Buddhist doctrine of upaya (skillful means)—the path adapts to the traveler, not vice versa. The concept of "space-awareness appearing as field" (dbyings rig zhing du snang ba) indicates that the non-dual ground manifests as the appearance-field of experience without losing its essential nature.

[9229-9238] <structure>
The section details the three capacities: best faculty realizes wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising without bodily realization; middle faculty realizes only self-awareness without birth; last faculty realizes appearance as like illusion or emanation.

[9239-9274]
. Second intention: wisdom's general filling—empowerment perfected from the beginning.

[9239-9251] <structure>
This section presents the second intention, focusing on the realization of awareness's power-empowerment (rig pa'i rtsal dbang) as spontaneously perfected (lhun grub). The structure maintains the threefold capacity differentiation but now emphasizes empowerment and energetic blessing.

[9239-9274] <philology>
The term dbang bskur (empowerment) carries the technical tantric meaning of consecration that awakens latent potentials. The compound ye nas lhun grub (perfected from the beginning) employs the distinctive Dzogchen vocabulary of spontaneous presence—qualities exist primordially without needing construction. The phrase thig le'i bar khyab (spreading to bindu) indicates the subtle energetic expansion throughout the body's essence-drops. The metaphor mkha' mnyam bde chen (sky-equal great bliss) combines spatial imagery with affective quality.

[9239-9274] <context>
The "general filling" (spyi dgang) metaphor suggests comprehensive pervasion—wisdom fills all aspects of experience like water filling a vessel. The distinction between realizing "birthless fruit as self-nature" (skye med 'bras bu rang bzhin du) versus realizing "appearance becoming awareness's power" (snang ba rig pa'i rtsal du 'gyur) indicates different entry points to the same realization: some practitioners recognize the result directly, others recognize the process of transformation. The "white-red awakening mind" (dkar dmar byang chub sems) refers to the subtle energies (bindu) of the body—white male essence at the crown, red female essence at the navel.

[9239-9274] <context>
The conduct described for the best faculty—"without pure-impure in white-red awakening mind"—indicates advanced tantric practice where ordinary dualistic judgments are transcended. The fruit of "seeing suchness of Buddha-family ground" (rigs kyi gzhi de bzhin nyid mthong) indicates recognition of the primordial buddha-nature that is the ground of all Buddha families (rigs lnga). The progressive sophistication from best to last faculty—direct recognition to deity practice to intermediate state methods—reflects the pedagogical realism of matching methods to capacity.

[9239-9274] <concept>
The ontology here emphasizes that empowerment is not a transfer of power from external source but recognition of inherent power (rtsal) already present. This reflects the Dzogchen rejection of gradual construction in favor of immediate recognition. The concept of "birthless" (skye med) indicates that the fruit is not produced by causes but recognized as primordially present—like finding a jewel in one's own pocket that was always there but overlooked.

[9251-9263] <structure>
The middle section details the three capacities: best realizes birthless fruit through empowerment; middle realizes appearance becoming awareness's power; last realizes empowerment qualities expanding.

[9263-9274] <structure>
The conclusion presents the specific methods for each capacity, transitioning to the third intention.

[9275-9314]
. Third intention: bindu range-penetration—self-arising awareness wisdom.

[9275-9288] <structure>
This section addresses the third intention, focusing on penetrating the range (zang thal) of bindu—subtle energetic essences—through self-arising awareness wisdom (rang shar rig pa'i ye shes). The structure presents a more technical and subtle level of practice involving the intermediate state (bar do).

[9275-9314] <philology>
The term zang thal (range-penetration) indicates unimpeded passage through all dimensions of experience. The compound rang shar (self-arising) distinguishes authentic wisdom from constructed meditation experiences—spontaneous versus fabricated. The phrase skad cig gsum na grol (liberation in three moments) employs the temporal term skad cig (moment/instant) to indicate immediate recognition. The metaphor gnam la 'pho ba 'dra (like meteor moving in sky) evokes rapid, bright, unimpeded movement.

[9275-9314] <context>
The bindu practices represent the subtle body dimension of Dzogchen, working with the channels (rtsa), winds (rlung), and essences (thig le) that support awareness. The three-moment liberation reflects the Dzogchen teaching that recognition can be instantaneous—first moment perception, second moment recognition, third moment liberation. The "great leakless dharmatā bliss" (chos nyid kyi bde ba gchus med chen po) refers to the stable bliss of reality unmixed with ordinary conditioned pleasure.

[9275-9314] <context>
The progression of methods reflects increasing subtlety: the best faculty achieves liberation through direct recognition, the middle through bliss-emptiness experience, and the last through analytical inquiry into the source of appearances. The "doubt and indecision conduct" (the tshom yid gnyis kyi spyod pa) for the last faculty indicates that even uncertainty, when properly engaged, becomes the path—doubt itself reveals the nature of mind when examined.

[9275-9314] <concept>
The phenomenology of bindu practices addresses the interface between physiological and spiritual dimensions. The bindu are not merely physical substances but the "subtle body" dimension of awareness itself—the interface between form and emptiness. The concept of "self-arising" (rang shar) is crucial: genuine signs of progress arise spontaneously without deliberate cultivation, distinguishing authentic recognition from fabricated experiences.

[9288-9301] <structure>
The middle section presents the three capacities with their distinct views: best like meteor in sky, middle realizing leakless bliss, last inquiring into source of appearances.

[9301-9314] <structure>
The conclusion synthesizes the intentions and conduct, leading to the fourth intention.

[9315-9352]
. Fourth intention: sun-moon equal gap—appearance-emptiness equality without ceasing.

[9315-9327] <structure>
This section presents the fourth intention, focusing on the equality (mnyam pa) of appearance and emptiness symbolized by sun and moon. The structure maintains the three-capacity framework while emphasizing the integration of method (sun) and wisdom (moon).

[9315-9352] <philology>
The term nyi zlam mnyam skas (sun-moon equal gap) employs architectural metaphor—skas (gap/aperture) indicating the passage or opening where dualities meet. The compound snang stong mnyam pa (appearance-emptiness equality) presents the quintessential Dzogchen formulation of the middle way. The phrase thabs dang shes rab (method and wisdom) invokes the fundamental Buddhist binary that must be transcended through recognition of their non-duality. The enumeration "practice and release two, four aspects" (sgras grol gnyis cha bzhi) indicates sophisticated integration of effort and effortless release.

[9315-9352] <context>
The sun-moon symbolism pervades Buddhist tantra, representing the union of method (male/active/skillful means) and wisdom (female/passive/emptiness understanding). The "equal gap" indicates that these are neither identical nor different—they meet in a "gap" that is also a union. The citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs continues the scriptural grounding of this chapter's teachings.

[9315-9352] <context>
The methods described progress from non-dual spontaneity (best) through dual cultivation (middle) to deity generation (last). The "womb of five Buddha-families" (rigs lnga'i sgrum) indicates tantric completion stage practices where enlightenment is nurtured like a fetus in the womb. The "father-mother practice" (yab yum) indicates sexual yoga symbolism, where the union of male and female represents the union of all dualities.

[9315-9352] <concept>
The metaphysics of equality (mnyam pa) presented here is not mere sameness but the recognition that apparent opposites share the same nature. Appearance is empty, emptiness appears—these are not sequential stages but simultaneous dimensions of the same reality. The concept of "without gathering or separation" (bsdus dbyer med) indicates that method and wisdom are neither artificially joined nor inherently separate—they are always already unified in awareness.

[9327-9340] <structure>
The middle section details the three capacities: best realizing wisdom as open without separation from wisdom river; middle realizing view without method-wisdom duality; last realizing through father-mother practice.

[9340-9352] <structure>
The conclusion synthesizes the four intentions and transitions to the fifth.

[9353-9384]
. Fifth intention: ocean expanse-penetration—dharmatā equal-clear force-samādhi.

[9353-9363] <structure>
This final intention presents the most universal and expansive modality—penetrating the ocean-like expanse (rgya mtsho dbyings) of dharmatā (chos nyid). The structure presents the culmination of the five intentions, with each capacity finding its appropriate resolution.

[9353-9384] <philology>
The term rgya mtsho (ocean) metaphorically indicates vastness, depth, and inexhaustibility—the qualities of dharmatā. The compound mnyam gsal (equal-clear) combines equality (mnyam) with clarity (gsal) to indicate the non-dual nature of the ground. The phrase rtsal gyi ting 'dzin (force-samādhi) indicates meditative absorption empowered by awareness's natural potency, not constructed effort. The metaphor chu 'bab (waterfall) evokes continuous, powerful, unceasing flow.

[9353-9384] <context>
The "ocean expanse" represents the ultimate dimension of practice where all distinctions dissolve into universal pervasiveness. The "one-cut not abiding in appearance" (gcig chod snang la mi gnas) indicates the Dzogchen teaching of single decisive recognition that transcends all attachment to phenomena. The contrast between best faculty obtaining wisdom non-abiding and last faculty obtaining "god and human status" (lha mi'i gnas) demonstrates the range of possible outcomes—from full enlightenment to elevated rebirth—depending on capacity and recognition.

[9353-9384] <context>
The metaphors employed in the concluding verses synthesize the five intentions: lion's play (conquering fear), king's empowerment (obtaining power), peacock emerging (reaching purity), sun-moon equality (expanding vastness), and sun arising (self-appearance as wisdom). These poetic images encapsulate the experiential essence of each intention for practitioners of different capacities.

[9353-9384] <concept>
The ontology of ocean expanse indicates that the ultimate nature is not limited to any particular form or experience but pervades all like water pervading the ocean. The concept of "self-appearance clear as wisdom" (rang snang ye shes su gsal) indicates the final resolution: all appearances are recognized as wisdom-display, samsara is nirvana, delusion is enlightenment. This is not philosophical position but direct recognition—the "force-samādhi" that naturally abides in dharmatā.

[9363-9374] <structure>
The middle section presents the three capacities: best realizing all appearance as self-appearance; middle realizing view as clear-open wisdom-body; last desiring to abandon delusory appearance.

[9374-9384] <structure>
The conclusion presents the summarizing verses with metaphors for each intention and the numerical summary of sixty Dharma enumerations.

[9385-9403]
. Summarizing meaning: five intentions binding secret heart-essence yogins.

[9385-9394] <structure>
This final section synthesizes the entire presentation of five intentions, demonstrating how each addresses a specific dimension of yogic experience. The structure presents both summary verses and numerical analysis, establishing the comprehensive scope of these methods.

[9385-9403] <philology>
The term snying tig (heart-essence) indicates the most profound and condensed teachings, comparable to the heart's central role in the body. The compound bskyangs bskyangs (washed high) evokes the image of purification and elevation—the view conquering fear and elevating the practitioner. The phrase dus gsum dag pa (pure complete nature of three times) indicates that wisdom experience transcends temporal limitation. The numerical analysis—five intentions, three faculties, four aspects (view, intention, conduct, fruit) yielding sixty Dharma enumerations—demonstrates the systematic nature of Nyingma taxonomy.

[9385-9403] <context>
The sixty Dharma enumerations correspond to purifying sixty aspects of eon increase-decrease (bskal pa 'phel 'grib), sentient beings' affliction (sems can nyon mongs), and view (lta ba). This numerological correlation reflects the Buddhist penchant for systematic enumeration as pedagogical and soteriological technology. The citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs provides the poetic authority for the metaphors, while the closing reference to rDo rje 'chang (Vajra-Holder) establishes the teaching's tantric lineage.

[9385-9403] <context>
The summarizing verses encapsulate the function of each intention: mountain general meaning transcends view distinctions; wisdom general filling grasps ground as self-abiding; bindu range-penetration examines liberation from space-appearance; sun-moon equal gap delivers intention to Dharma-ceasing; ocean expanse-penetration stably holds primordially pure ground. These one-sentence summaries provide mnemonic devices for practitioners.

[9385-9403] <concept>
The philosophical synthesis here demonstrates the Dzogchen path as both comprehensive (covering all necessary aspects) and efficient (each practice addressing multiple dimensions simultaneously). The concept of "binding" ('ching ba) indicates that these five intentions encompass all essential points—practitioners need not look elsewhere. The "spontaneous leap-over" (thod rgal) wisdom referenced in the chapter title indicates that these practices enable transcending the gradual path, jumping directly to recognition.
