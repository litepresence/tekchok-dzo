Ninth Ground: Perfection of Excellent Qualities
**Analysis:** This passage completes the presentation of the ninth ground (*dgu pa*)—attainment of the Ground of Excellent Intelligence (*legs pa'i blo gros kyi sa*). The structure presents three elements: (1) the ground name and ordinal; (2) the defining characteristic—wisdom's vision seized by self-knowing (*rang gi shes pa zin*); (3) the resultant experience—spontaneous luminosity (*lhug par shar ba*). The verse form at 5925 marks this as a major enumeration point, while 5926-5927 provide explanatory prose.

[5925-5927] <philology>
**Analysis:** Line 5925: *dgu pa legs pa'i blo gros kyi sa non pa'o*—"The ninth: attainment of the Ground of Excellent Intelligence." The ground name *legs pa'i blo gros* (excellent intelligence/sublime prajñā) renders Sanskrit *Sādhumatī*. The verb *non* (attained/seized) indicates mastery over this ground.

Line 5926: *de nas ye shes kyi snang ba la rang gi shes pa zin nas snang ba lhug par shar ba ni*—"Thereafter, upon self-knowing having seized wisdom's vision, luminosity dawns spontaneously." The construction uses *ye shes kyi snang ba* (wisdom's vision) as object, with *rang gi shes pa zin nas* (self-knowing having seized) as agent. The term *lhug par* (spontaneously/naturally) modifies *shar ba* (dawning).

Line 5927: *chos thams cad kyi sprin lta bur mthong nas goms pa ni*—"Through habituation, seeing all dharmas as clouds—this is the attainment." The simile *sprin lta bu* (like clouds) indicates insubstantiality and impermanence.

**Analysis:** This passage belongs to Chapter 18's systematic presentation of the bodhisattva grounds (*byang chub sems dpa'i sa*). The Ninth Ground (*Sādhumatī*/*legs pa'i blo gros*) is characterized by perfection of the four analytical knowledges (*so so yang dag par rig pa bzhi*): (1) *chos so so yang dag par rig pa*—analytical knowledge of dharmas; (2) *don so so yang dag par rig pa*—analytical knowledge of meaning; (3) *nges pa'i tshig so so yang dag par rig pa*—analytical knowledge of definitive words; (4) *spobs pa so so yang dag par rig pa*—analytical knowledge of eloquence. The "seizing of wisdom's vision" refers to bodhisattvas here achieving the *mngon shes* (higher knowledges) without impediment. The simile of clouds appears frequently in Prajñāpāramitā literature—all phenomena appear but lack inherent existence, like clouds in the sky.

[5925-5927] <concept>
**Analysis:** The Ninth Ground represents the perfection of discriminative wisdom (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*), distinct from the non-discriminative wisdom (*mi rtog pa'i ye shes*) emphasized at the Eighth Ground. At this stage, bodhisattvas achieve: (1) *chos kyi sku'i yon tan rdzogs pa*—complete qualities of dharmakāya; (2) *mtshan ma'i rtsa ba chod pa*—cutting the root of signs/conceptuality; (3) *sangs rgyas kyi zhing yongs su dag pa*—complete purification of Buddha-fields. The "seizing" (*zin*) of wisdom's vision indicates irreversible mastery—the bodhisattva cannot lose this realization. The cloud simile captures the two truths (*bden gnyis*): clouds appear (conventional truth) but lack substantial nature (ultimate truth). This ground perfects the ability to teach beings through the four analytical knowledges, manifesting the sambhogakāya for advanced bodhisattvas while emanating nirmāṇakāyas for ordinary beings.
