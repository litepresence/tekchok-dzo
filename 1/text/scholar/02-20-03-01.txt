First: The Basis Never Corrupted
**Analysis:** This passage presents the first (*dang po*) of three or more points concerning the nature of awareness (*rig pa*) and delusion (*'khrul pa*). The structure establishes a paradox: although awareness transcends the basis (*gzhi nas 'phags*) and wanders in samsaric delusion (*'khor bar 'khrul*), it never becomes corrupted (*ngan du song ba med*). The second element presents the solution: through the lama's direct introduction (*bla mas ngo sprad*), recognition (*rtsad chod*) of the wandering that comes from losing (*stor*) that awareness produces joy (*dga' ba*).

[8970-8971] <philology>
**Analysis:** Line 8970: *dang po gzhi nas 'phags te 'khor bar 'khrul yang rig pa ngan du song ba med*—"First: Though one transcends the basis and wanders in delusion through samsara, awareness does not become corrupted." The construction *gzhi nas 'phags* (transcended from the basis) uses the ablative *nas* indicating source. The adversative *yang* (though/although) introduces the paradox—despite wandering, awareness remains pure. The phrase *ngan du song ba* (gone to the bad/corrupted) with negative *med* affirms intrinsic purity.

Line 8971: *de nas bla mas ngo sprad de stor nas 'khyams pa de phyis rtsad chod dus dga' ba dang*—"Then, through the lama's direct introduction, when one recognizes the wandering that comes from losing that, joy arises." The construction *ngo sprad* (direct introduction) is the technical term for pointing-out instructions. The *stor* (lost) indicates separation from recognition. The compound *rtsad chod* (decided recognition/certainty) marks decisive understanding.

[8970-8971] <context>
**Analysis:** This passage belongs to Chapter 20 (*don bzhi pa*—Fourth Meaning), likely presenting the threefold or fourfold meaning structure. The teaching that awareness remains uncorrupted despite wandering is foundational to Dzogchen: the basis (*gzhi*) is primordially pure (*ka dag*), therefore even delusion is temporary adventitious defilement (*glo bur dri ma*) rather than intrinsic nature. The "direct introduction" (*ngo sprod*) refers to the unique Dzogchen method where the lama introduces the student directly to awareness (*rig pa*) beyond gradual cultivation. This differs from sūtrayāna paths requiring progressive purification. The joy (*dga' ba*) arising from recognition corresponds to the first of the four joys (*dga' ba bzhi*)—the joy of recognition (*ngos 'dzin dga' ba*).

[8970-8971] <concept>
**Analysis:** This passage presents the core Dzogchen doctrine of *gnyug ma'i rig pa* (innate awareness) as the ground (*gzhi*) that remains unchanged (*ma 'gags*) throughout all states—liberation, delusion, and transition between them. The paradox of transcending the basis yet wandering (*gzhi nas 'phags te 'khor bar 'khrul*) is resolved through understanding two senses of "basis": (1) the ultimate basis (*don dam gyi gzhi*)—primordial purity never transcended; (2) the deluded basis (*'khrul pa'i gzhi*)—the temporary unawareness that appears to obscure recognition. The lama's introduction functions as *rigs rtsal* (awareness's dynamic display) awakening the student's *gnyug ma* (innate nature). The joy arises because recognition reveals that corruption was never possible—*ngan song* (lower realms), *ngan 'gro* (evil destinies), and all suffering were appearances to awareness, not transformations of awareness itself.
