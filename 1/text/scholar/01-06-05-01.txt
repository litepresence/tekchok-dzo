# The Four Joys: First Joy—Engaging Wisdom-Wind Activities
**Analysis:** This brief passage initiates the enumeration (*bsdus pa*) of the Four Joys (*dga' ba bzhi*), a classification of meditative experiences or stages within completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practice. The ordinal marker *dang po* (first) establishes the sequence, while the continuative *ste* (emphatic/inceptive) signals the beginning of exposition. The structure presents: (1) Joy classification (*dga' ba*) + ordinal; (2) Activity description (*spyod pa*) + object of engagement. This terse formulation suggests this is a structural marker or list entry within a larger discussion of the Four Convictions (*gtan la phab pa bzhi*), specifically addressing conviction regarding meditation results.

**Analysis:** The phrase *'jug pa'i ye shes* (wisdom of entering) employs the genitive to specify the type of wisdom—entry into the nature rather than observing from outside. The compound *rlung gi 'phen pa dang sdud pa* uses the genitive *gi* to create the wind's agent—winds that propel and gather. The verbs *'phen pa* (to propel/project) and *sdud pa* (to gather/contract) represent complementary wind functions: expansion and contraction, dispersion and concentration. The verb *spyod* (to engage in/conduct) appears without object marker, suggesting absolute engagement—engagement itself as the practice. This grammatical construction emphasizes the activity (*spyod pa*) rather than the agent or object.

**Analysis:** The Four Joys (*dga' ba bzhi*) represent progressive stages of bliss in completion stage practice, correlated with the four empowerments and four levels of joy: (1) *dga' ba* (joy)—ordinary pleasure; (2) *mchog dga'* (supreme joy)—intensified pleasure; (3) *khyad dga'* (special joy)—non-dual pleasure; (4) *lhun grub kyi dga'* (spontaneously accomplished joy)—natural, uncontrived pleasure. This first joy corresponds to the vase empowerment and the initial dissolution of coarse fixation. The "propelling and gathering" (*'phen sdud*) refers to the wind exercises (*rlung gi rnal 'byor*) wherein the yogi projects the winds to the extremities (*'phen*) and draws them back to the central channel (*sdud*), thereby activating the wisdom of entering (*'jug pa'i ye shes*).

**Analysis:** The Four Joys represent the *smin byed* (ripening) dimension of wind-energy practices. As the winds are propelled and gathered through the channels, they stimulate the essences (*thig le*) producing progressive bliss-states. The "wisdom of entering" (*'jug pa'i ye shes*) is the first level of entry into the non-conceptual—cognitive clarity without fixation. This corresponds to the *rtog pa dang bcas pa'i dga' ba* (joy with conceptuality), where bliss is present but conceptual mind still operates. The practice engages the *kun 'dar* (all-pervading) wind and the *gnyan khrod* (sustaining) wind in their projective and retractive functions, establishing the energetic basis for subsequent higher joys.
