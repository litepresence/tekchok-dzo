[998-998] <context>

**Analysis:** The third tier (*bang rim gsum pa*) of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three houses gods perpetually intoxicated by honey-wine (*sbrang chang gis rtag tu myos pa'i lha*). This completes the progression from protection (tier 1) to beauty (tier 2) to sensory indulgence (tier 3)—the trajectory of desire-realm evolution from coarse to subtle gratification. The intoxication represents the subtlest level of desire-realm pleasure before transitioning to the form realm's meditative absorptions.
