[3017-3021] [STRUCTURE]
This section continues the exposition of False Aspectarian (rnam rdzun pa) Cittamātra from the True Aspectarian (rnam bden pa) discussion on previous pages. The structure follows a threefold analytical framework:

1. **Lines 2994-3001**: Analysis of the nature of perception through the egg-split simile (sgo nga bkas pa), addressing the apparent duality of perceived aspect (rnam pa) and perceiving consciousness (shes pa)

2. **Lines 3002-3008**: Presentation of the monkey-fortress analogy (mkhar gyi nang na spre'u) to illustrate how one consciousness cognizes diverse objects through the five sense doors

3. **Lines 3009-3021**: Division of False Aspectarians into two sub-schools:
   - Those who assert appearance with stains (dri bcas rdzun pa ba)
   - Those who assert pure appearance (dri med dag pa ba)

The section concludes with the assertion that ultimately nothing is established as consciousness (rnam shes su grub pa ni ci yang med), pointing to the dharmakāya.

================================================================================

[2994] [PHILOLOGY] **de 'dzin pa'i shes pa'ang sems las byung bas** — "The consciousness that apprehends that also arises from mind"
- **de 'dzin pa**: Apprehending that (object)
- **shes pa**: Consciousness (cognitive function)
- **sems las byung ba**: Arisen from mind (cittānvaya)
- The particle **'ang** (also) indicates this is extending the previous argument about the perceived object to include the perceiving subject

[2995] [PHILOLOGY] **sgo nga bkas pa** — "Split egg" (egg hatching simile)
- **sgo nga**: Egg
- **bkas pa**: Split, cracked open (past tense of 'gebs)
- This simile illustrates how from one source (the egg/mind), two apparent aspects emerge (the shell halves / perceiver and perceived)

[3017-3021] [CONTEXT]
**Cittamātra School Background**: This section represents the classical Yogācāra philosophical position as developed by Vasubandhu (dbyig gnyen), Dharmapāla (chos skyong), and Sthiramati (blo brtan). The False Aspectarian (rnam rdzun pa = sa-sākāra-vijñāna-vādin) position holds that both the perceived aspect (nimitta) and perceiving consciousness are false/provisionally real.

[2995] [CONTEXT] **The Egg Simile**: This is a traditional Yogācāra metaphor found in Vasubandhu's commentarial tradition. Just as a chick emerges when an egg splits, and the two halves appear distinct but came from one source, so too do perceiver and perceived arise from the single mind. This simile appears in texts like the *Triṃśikā* commentaries.

[2997] [CONTEXT] **Beginningless Latent Tendencies (thog ma med pa'i bag chags)**: This refers to the ālaya-vijñāna (kun gzhi rnam par shes pa) and its latent tendencies that cause the dualistic appearance of subject and object. The concept originates in the *Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra* (dgongs pa nges par 'grel pa'i mdo) and is extensively developed in the Yogācārabhūmi.

[3004] [CONTEXT] **Monkey-Fortress Analogy**: This famous simile appears in various Yogācāra texts, notably in Dharmapāla's commentary on the *Madhyāntavibhāga*. The fortress represents the body, the monkey represents consciousness, and the four windows represent the sense doors. The Yogācārins use this to show that despite the diversity of perceptions, there is only one perceiving consciousness.

[3008] [CONTEXT] **Dream Analogy (rmi lam gyi snang ba)**: The comparison to dream consciousness is fundamental to Yogācāra epistemology. In dreams, the dream appearance and the dream consciousness are not different in nature (gnyid gcig gi shes par tha mi dad pa). This appears in the *Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi* and is cited by Dharmakīrti.

[3017-3021] [CONTEXT]
**Division of False Aspectarians**: 
- **dri bcas rdzun pa ba** (Sanskrit: *sā-kaḍuṣṭa-sākāra-vijñāna-vādin*): Those who hold that the appearance aspect is tainted by mental defilements. Associated with some followers of Dharmapāla.
- **dri med dag pa ba** (Sanskrit: *nir-kaḍuṣṭa-sākāra-vijñāna-vādin*): Those who hold that the appearance is pure, like a reflection (gzugs brnyan).

This doxographic division is found in Tibetan Cittamātra commentaries, particularly in works by Ngok Lotsawa (rngog blo ldan shes rab) and the Sakya scholars.

[3019] [CONTEXT] **Non-dual Wisdom (gnyis su med pa'i ye shes)**: This refers to the transformation of the ālaya-vijñāna into the mirror-like wisdom (me long lta bu'i ye shes, ādarśa-jñāna) at Buddhahood. The assertion that ultimately nothing is established as consciousness points to the dharmakāya (chos sku), which transcends all conceptual categories including consciousness.

================================================================================
[CONCEPT] Breaking Down Complex Ideas
================================================================================

[3017-3021] [CONCEPT]
**Two Sub-schools of False Aspectarians**:

1. **Appearance with Stains (dri bcas rdzun pa ba)**: Holds that the diverse appearances we experience now (white, red, various forms) are mental defilements (blo'i dri ma) projected onto the ultimate non-dual wisdom. This is like seeing colors through a stained glass—the colors appear real but are actually the stain.

2. **Pure Appearance (dri med dag pa ba)**: Holds that even the appearance aspect is ultimately unreal (brdzun pa tsam du'ang grub pa med). All that ultimately exists is self-cognizing awareness experiencing itself (so so rang gi rig pa'i ye shes). The appearances are like reflections in a mirror—clearly manifesting but having no substantial existence.

**Ultimate Point**: The Buddha's dharmakāya (chos sku) has nothing remaining (lhag ma med pa) in the sense that no conceptual category, including "consciousness" or "wisdom," can capture its nature. It is beyond all elaboration.

[3021] [CONCEPT] **Dharmakāya as Ultimate Truth**: The conclusion points to the dharmakāya not as "something" but as the exhaustion of all conceptual fabrication. When all false appearances are removed, what remains is not another "thing" called dharmakāya—rather, the absence of fabrication IS the dharmakāya. Like space: it's not that space "is something"; space is the absence of obstruction.

SCHOLAR NOTES
================================================================================

- The page number in the original Tibetan text would be folio 41a (front)
- This section follows the standard Cittamātra doxography found in Tibetan grub mtha' literature
- Longchenpa's presentation is distinctive in how it leads the Cittamātra analysis toward the dzogchen view of dharmakāya
- The egg simile is particularly significant as it shows the non-dual nature of subject-object while still accounting for apparent duality

[3022-3036] [STRUCTURE]
This page completes the Cittamātra presentation and transitions to Svātantrika Madhyamaka. The structural progression follows:

1. **Lines 3022-3027**: Completion of Pure Appearance (dri med dag pa ba) position—explaining how afflictions mixed with wisdom are removed to reveal pure non-dual wisdom

2. **Lines 3028-3034**: Elaboration of Pure Appearance view—appearances and consciousness have no true establishment even conventionally

3. **Lines 3035-3048**: Transition to Svātantrika Madhyamaka (dbu ma pa la rang rgyud pa), which further refutes Cittamātra's residual subtle realism

**Doxographical Architecture**:
- Cittamātra completes with assertion of self-cognizing wisdom as ultimately existent
- Svātantrika refutes even this residual essentialism
- Within Svātantrika, two branches introduced:
  * Illusion-like Ultimate (sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa)
  * Complete Non-abiding (rab tu mi gnas pa)

================================================================================

[3022-3023] [PHILOLOGY]
**gnyis su med pa'i ye shes nyid de / dri ma med pa'i de bzhin nyid yin la**
- **nyid de**: Emphatic "itself is" — highlighting identity
- **dri ma med pa'i de bzhin nyid**: Stainless suchness (nirmala-tathatā)
- **de bzhin nyid**: Suchness, thusness (tathatā) — ultimate nature
- Grammatical note: **yin la** (being...) sets up the contrast in the next line

[3024] [PHILOLOGY] **lhag bcas kyi gnas skabs**
- **lhag bcas**: With remainder, with residue (śeṣa-sahita)
- **gnas skabs**: Occasion, phase, state (avasthā)
- Technical term: The state where subtle defilements remain latent

[3022-3027] [CONTEXT]
**Pure Appearance School (dri med dag pa ba)**: This sub-school of False Aspectarian Cittamātra holds that when the false portion of afflictions mixed with wisdom is removed, what remains is pure non-dual wisdom. This position is associated with Sthiramati (blo brtan) and some commentarial traditions. The "remainder" (lhag ma) refers to subtle traces of dualistic perception that persist even for āryas until Buddhahood.

[3022-3027] [CONCEPT]
**Wisdom Mixed with Afflictions**: The text describes a profound condition: in ordinary beings, non-dual wisdom (ye shes) is present but mixed with afflictions (nyon mongs pa), like milk mixed with water. The defilements are not separate from wisdom—they are adventitious (glo bur) obscurations that cover the naturally pure nature.

**The Process of Purification**: The false portion (rdzun pa ba'i cha) of this mixture is removed, revealing the pure wisdom that was always there. This is not a "creation" of wisdom but a "revealing" of what was obscured. Like cleaning a dirty mirror—the mirror's reflective nature was never lost, only covered.

**With Remainder (lhag bcas)**: During the path, subtle traces remain—like the lingering taste of medicine or the residual effects of past sickness. These are not coarse defilements but subtle habits of dualistic perception that persist until Buddhahood.

[3024-3025] [PHILOLOGY]
**bag la nyal gyi dri ma cung zad yod pas 'khrul par snang ba gzigs pa dang / ro rgyab snyung ba la sogs pa yod do**
- **bag la nyal**: Dormant, latent (anuśaya)
- **cung zad**: Slight, a little — diminutive particle
- **ro rgyab snyung ba**: Taste and sickness — examples of residual impurity
- **la sogs pa**: "And so forth" — indicating these are examples, not exhaustive

[3026] [PHILOLOGY] **nyon mongs pa dang ye shes 'dres par gnas pa'i dri ma nyon mongs pa'i cha rdzun pa ba bsal bas**
- **'dres par gnas pa**: Mixed, intermingled (miśra-sthita)
- **dri ma...cha**: The portion/aspect that is defilement
- **rdzun pa ba**: False, unreal — here used as object to be removed
- **bsal bas**: Having removed (past gerund) — instrumental causal construction

[3024-3025] [CONTEXT]
**Residual Defilements**: The examples of taste (ro) and sickness (rgyab snyung) illustrate how subtle defilements remain in advanced practitioners. The *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* and its commentaries discuss how āryas on the path still have subtle obscurations to be removed. These are not coarse afflictions but subtle habits of dualistic perception.

[3028-3031] [PHILOLOGY]
**mngon par chags pa dag gis na chung yid la byed pa goms pa las / ji zhig na bsam ma dgos par / de'i byad bzhin gyi snang ba med pa gsal snang du shar ba bzhin no**
- **mngon par chags pa dag**: Attachments, clingings (abhiniveśa)
- **na chung**: Early, from childhood/youth
- **goms pa**: Habituation, familiarity (abhyāsa)
- **bsam ma dgos par**: Without needing to think/cogitate
- **byad bzhin**: Form, appearance (ākr̥ti)
- **gsal snang du shar ba**: Arising as clear appearance — **shar ba** suggests spontaneous manifestation rather than constructed appearance

[3028-3034] [CONTEXT]
**The Reflection (gzugs brnyan) Simile**: This is the key simile for the Pure Appearance view. Just as a reflection in a mirror appears clearly but has no substantial existence, so do all appearances arise while being empty of true existence. This differs from the "with stains" view which sees appearances as defiled; the pure view sees appearances themselves as naturally pure reflections.

[3035] [CONTEXT] **Svātantrika Madhyamaka (dbu ma rang rgyud pa)**: Founded by Bhāvaviveka (legs ldan 'byed, c. 500-570 CE) as a response to Dignāga's epistemology. The Svātantrikas accept that conventionally, things exist with their own characteristics (svalakṣaṇa), but ultimately they are empty of inherent existence. Key figures: Bhāvaviveka, Kamalaśīla, Śāntarakṣita.

[3037] [CONTEXT] **Svātantrika vs. Cittamātra**: The Svātantrika critique targets the Cittamātra assertion that self-cognizing wisdom ultimately exists. Svātantrikas argue that even this "ultimate" consciousness is empty of inherent existence. This represents a crucial shift from "mind-only" to "emptiness-of-all-phenomena."

[3028-3034] [CONCEPT]
**The Pure Appearance View Explained**: This is one of the most subtle positions in Buddhist philosophy. It holds that:

1. All appearances (colors, forms, objects) are like reflections in a mirror
2. They appear clearly (gsal snang) — we cannot deny our experience
3. But they have no true existence (med bzhin du snang) — they are empty
4. The only thing that ultimately exists is self-cognizing wisdom

**The Mirror Analogy**: A mirror reflects your face. The reflection appears—it's not nothing. But does the reflection have true existence? Can you grasp it? Does it exist independently of the mirror and your face? The Pure Appearance view says: all phenomena are like this reflection—appearing but empty.

**Key Distinction**: Unlike the "with stains" view which sees appearances as defiled projections, the pure view sees appearances as naturally pure. The problem is not the appearances themselves but our grasping at them as truly existent.

[3032-3033] [PHILOLOGY]
**yul gyi rnam pa dkar dmar sna tshogs su snang ba dang / 'jal byed kyi blo gnyis ka med bzhin du snang ba gzugs brnyan lta bu**
- **dkar dmar**: White and red — metonymy for all colors
- **gnyis ka med bzhin du**: While both are non-existent
- **gzugs brnyan**: Reflection, image (pratibimba) — crucial simile in Pure Appearance view
- **lta bu**: Like, similar to — simile particle

[3035] [PHILOLOGY] **dbu ma pa la rang rgyud pa**
- **rang rgyud pa**: Svātantrika — "Autonomous [reasoning]" school
- Etymology: Those who use autonomous inferences (svatantra-anumāna) to establish emptiness

[3035-3036] [CONCEPT]
**The Svātantrika Revolution**: This is a watershed moment in Buddhist philosophy. The Svātantrikas say: "You Cittamātrins claim that self-cognizing wisdom is ultimately real. But we ask: does this wisdom exist inherently? If it truly exists (truly ultimate), it must have inherent existence. But inherent existence cannot be found!"

**The Three Natures Revisited**: The Cittamātra uses the three natures (trisvabhāva):
1. Imagined nature (parikalpita) — totally unreal
2. Dependent nature (paratantra) — conventionally real  
3. Perfected nature (pariniṣpanna) — ultimately real

Svātantrika says: Even the perfected nature is empty of inherent existence. The ultimate truth is not a "thing" that exists.

**Illusion-like Ultimate**: The Svātantrika proposes that the ultimate truth is like an illusion (sgyu ma). It appears (we have valid cognition of emptiness), but it has no inherent existence. This preserves the validity of appearance while denying essence.
