# Ground-Path-Result: The Expanse-Awareness Distinction
**Analysis:** This extensive section presents the threefold (*gsum*) structure of ground-path-result (*gzhi lam 'bras bu*) as applied to the expanse-awareness (*dbyings rig*) distinction. The structure comprises: (1) Ground (*gzhi*)—expanse-awareness abiding as infant's cord resonance in the five lights; (2) Path (*lam*)—expanse-awareness as appearance in the five lights' fortress; (3) Result (*'bras bu*)—expanse-awareness as original purity's self-appearance. Each level demonstrates the *dbyings rig gnyis* (expanse and awareness) relationship with supporting citations from *Senge rtsal rdzogs* (Complete Lion Potency). The section concludes with emphasis on distinguishing the crucial point (*gnad 'di phyed pa*) of expanse-awareness.

**Analysis:** The phrase *gzhi lam 'bras bu* employs the genitive to create the triadic structure—ground's, path's, result's [expanse-awareness]. The term *snying ga* (heart center) marks the location of the five lights (*'od lnga*). The compound *lu gu rgyud kyi gdangs* (infant's cord resonance) uses the genitive *kyi* with *gdangs* (resonance/tone/vibration)—the vibrational quality of the central channel (*dbu ma*), so-called because it is twisted like an infant's umbilical cord. The spatial markers *na* (in) indicate location: *snying ga na* (in the heart), *rtsa na* (in the channel). The verb *gnas* (to abide) appears in present tense, indicating continuous abiding. The *Senge rtsal rdzogs* citation employs the ablative *las* (from), introducing authoritative support. The phrase *nam mkha' sprin med pa lta bu* (like a cloudless sky) uses the simile marker *lta bu* (like/as) for comparison.

**Analysis:** This passage presents the fundamental *dbyings rig* (expanse-awareness) distinction central to *rDzogs chen* soteriology. The "infant's cord" (*lu gu rgyud*) refers to the central channel (*dbu ma rtsa*)—the *avadhūti*—which is twisted like an umbilical cord and serves as the support (*rten*) for awareness. The five lights (*'od lnga*) correspond to the five wisdoms and five Buddha-families, manifesting as colors: white, blue, yellow, red, green. The *Senge rtsal rdzogs* (Complete Lion Potency) is a *sNying thig* tantra attributed to Garab Dorje or Śrī Siṃha. The threefold structure—ground abiding, path appearance, result conveyance—maps the progressive recognition of the nature: ground = unrecognized expanse-awareness; path = recognizing appearance as expanse-awareness; result = complete integration of expanse-awareness.

**Analysis:** This section presents the *dbyings rig gnyis su med pa* (non-duality of expanse and awareness) through the *gzhi lam 'bras gsum* framework: (1) **Ground** (*gzhi*)—expanse (*dbyings*) = five lights' lamp; awareness (*rig pa*) = infant's cord clarity. The expanse is the field/ground; awareness is the knowing quality within it. (2) **Path** (*lam*)—expanse = light's rim/circle; awareness = five bodies' appearance. On the path, expanse appears as the container (light); awareness appears as the contained (forms). (3) **Result** (*'bras bu*)—expanse = original purity's self-appearance like cloudless sky; awareness = expanse-inside dissolve-appear as ground-only. At result, the distinction collapses—expanse IS awareness's display, awareness IS expanse's recognition. The "crucial point" (*gnad*) is to distinguish yet not separate these two—they are distinct in appearance (*snang ba*) but one in essence (*ngo bo).

# Second Division: Definite Measures of Primordial Wisdom
**Analysis:** This section presents the second (*gnyis pa*) division on definite measures (*tshad dngos*) of primordial wisdom (*ye shes*). The structure follows a sixfold instruction pattern: (1) When appearances are piece-by-piece—investigate thoroughly; (2) When extremely subtle and moving—accustom thoroughly; (3) When flickering and subtle and moving—see and grasp thoroughly; (4) When round and subtle and swirling—absorb firmly without distraction; (5) When flashing and flaming and body-appearing—grasp appearance as non-existent; (6) When all appearances are true—gather appearances. This establishes the *sbyangs gsum* (three purifications) through progressive familiarization.

**Analysis:** The phrase *ye shes nges pa'i gsang don* employs the genitive chain: primordial wisdom (*ye shes*) + definite (*nges pa*) + secret meaning (*gsang don*). The temporal markers *tshe* (time/when) indicate conditional application: *snang ba dum bu dum bu'i tshe* (when appearances are piece-by-piece). The imperative forms *brtag par bya* (must investigate), *gnas par bya* (must abide), *gzung bar bya* (must grasp) employ the *-par bya* construction indicating obligatory practice. The term *dum bu* (piece/fragment/part) suggests discrete, momentary appearances. The compound *'phrig dang 'phra* (flickering and subtle) combines rapid movement with minimal magnitude. The phrase *gtem dang mer* (flash and flame) indicates sudden illumination (*gtem*) and sustained burning (*mer*). The causative *bskyod* (to stir/move) in *ye shes bskyod pa* indicates the activation or arousal of primordial wisdom.

**Analysis:** These instructions derive from the *Thalgyur* (*Thal ba rang grol*) and *Senge rtsal rdzogs* tantras on *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) practice—specifically the *snang ba* (appearances) phase wherein light-mandala appearances manifest spontaneously. The six stages correspond to progressive dissolution of fixation: (1-2) recognizing subtle appearances; (3-4) stabilizing recognition without distraction; (5-6) transcending even the recognition of appearances. "Piece-by-piece" (*dum bu*) refers to *rtog pa* (conceptuality) breaking experience into discrete moments; the instruction is to investigate (*brtag*) their nature. "Primordial wisdom stirred" (*ye shes bskyod pa*) refers to activating the *rig pa rtsal* (potency of awareness) through practice, causing the five elements to dissolve into the expanse. The "definite time and date" (*dus dang tshes nges pa*) indicates the predictable timing of these experiences based on astrological and physiological factors.

**Analysis:** This section presents the *thod rgal snang bzhi* (four visions of direct transcendence) or *'od gsal snang bzhi* (four visions of clear light) in practical instruction form: (1) **Investigation** (*brtag pa*) of piece-by-piece appearances—analytical phase recognizing the constructed nature of experience; (2) **Accustomance** (*goms pa*) to subtle movement—stabilizing recognition of luminosity; (3) **Seeing-grasping** (*mthong gzuṅ*) of flickering appearances—non-conceptual recognition of appearances as awareness; (4) **Absorption** (*ting 'dzin*) without distraction—complete integration of appearance and awareness; (5) **Grasping non-existence** (*med pa gzuṅ*) of flashing appearances—transcending even the recognition; (6) **Gathering appearances** (*snang ba bsdu ba*)—all phenomena collapse into wisdom. The "warm, cool, etc." (*dro dang bsil ba*) indicate the *byang chub kyi yan lag bdun* (seven limbs of enlightenment) or elemental dissolution experiences. The final "expanse dissolving" (*dbyings su 'khyil*) indicates complete *thim rim* (dissolution sequence) into *chos dbyings* (dharmadhātu).
