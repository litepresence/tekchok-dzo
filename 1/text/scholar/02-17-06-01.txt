. Four mindfulnesses: body, sensation, mind, and dharmas.

[2779-2781] <philology>
The section addresses the four smṛtyupasthānas (dran pa nye bar gzhag pa bzhi) foundational to Buddhist practice. The instrumental particles (-kyis, -gis) function as means indicators showing how mindfulness operates as the antidote to distraction. The term lus (body) appears in compounds like lus kyi phra rgyas (body's subtle components), demonstrating the classical Abhidharma analysis applied within Dzogchen framework. The causative construction goms pa (familiarization) establishes the progressive nature of practice—mindfulness becomes automatic through repeated engagement.

[2782-2796] <context>
The passage cites authoritative tantric sources including Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, and Nyi zla kha sbyor, establishing doctrinal validity within bka' ma (oral tradition) lineages. The zhes so citation formula indicates these are transmitted teachings rather than original philosophical compositions. The four mindfulnesses represent the standard śrāvakayāna foundation that Dzogchen integrates without rejecting—demonstrating Longchenpa's synthetic methodology that encompasses rather than supersedes lower vehicles.

[2792-2802] <structure>
The passage demonstrates systematic presentation characteristic of Longchenpa's style. Structural markers rim pa organize the four mindfulnesses sequentially: body first (as coarsest), then sensation (dependent on body), then mind (subtler than sensation), then dharmas (most subtle objects of mind). The dbye ba framework distinguishes each mindfulness by its specific counteragent: body counters attachment to form, sensation counters craving, mind counters distraction, dharmas counters reification of phenomena.

[2797-2791] <concept>
The operational logic follows standard Buddhist lam rim structure: cause (ordinary distracted state), method (application of appropriate mindfulness), result (liberation from specific obscuration). The content demonstrates Anuyoga completion stage integration within Great Perfection—mindfulness is not rejected but recognized as preliminary to direct recognition. The key Dzogchen innovation: mindfulness becomes effortless when recognized as self-clarity rather than deliberate concentration.

. Four right exertions: prevention, abandonment, generation, maintenance.

[2803-2817] <philology>
Key technical terms require philological precision. The term yang dag spong ba (right exertion/abandonment) carries its Abhidharma technical sense of abandoning non-virtue and generating virtue. Instrumental particles (-kyis, -gis) indicate how each exertion serves as antidote to specific affliction. The causative construction sgom pa (cultivation) establishes the active nature of these practices—they must be deliberately developed before becoming spontaneous.

[2818-2832] <context>
Citations from Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, and Nyi zla kha sbyor establish doctrinal authority. The zhes so formula indicates transmission lineage. The four right exertions represent the common Mahāyāna foundation that Atiyoga presupposes—Longchenpa demonstrates that Dzogchen does not bypass conventional practice but includes it within ultimate recognition.

[2833-2836] <structure>
The passage demonstrates systematic presentation. Structural markers rim pa organize the four exertions: preventing non-virtue not yet arisen, abandoning non-virtue already arisen, generating virtue not yet arisen, maintaining virtue already arisen. The graduated approach reflects Buddhist lam rim structure adapted to Dzogchen.

[2837-2877]
. Four bases of miraculous power: aspiration, effort, mind, investigation.

[2837-2847] <structure>
The passage demonstrates Longchenpa's systematic presentation. Structural markers rim pa organize the four bases (rdzu 'phrul gyi rkang pa bzhi): aspiration (dun pa), effort (brtson 'grus), mind (sems), investigation (dpyod pa). The dbye ba distinguishes each by its specific quality that overcomes hindrances to miraculous powers.

[2848-2862] <philology>
The term rdzu 'phrul (miraculous power) carries its technical sense of abilities that transcend ordinary physical limitations. The compound rkang pa (basis/leg) metaphorically indicates the foundation upon which miraculous powers stand. Instrumental particles indicate how each basis serves as antidote to specific obscuration. Causative constructions establish operational relationships between practice and result.

[2863-2877] <context>
Citations from Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, and Nyi zla kha sbyor establish doctrinal authority within bka' ma tradition. The four bases represent the effortful phase of practice that Dzogchen practitioners engage before effortless recognition.

[2878-2911]
. Five faculties and five powers: faith, diligence, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom.

[2878-2911] <concept>
The operational logic—cause (ordinary state dominated by afflictions), method (cultivation of faculties/powers), result (dominance of virtuous qualities)—integrates standard Buddhist practice within Great Perfection framework. The content demonstrates that Dzogchen does not reject gradual cultivation but recognizes its provisional necessity. The faculties (dbang po) become powers (stobs) when strong enough to counter their opposing afflictions.

[2912-2922] <structure>
The passage demonstrates systematic presentation. Structural markers rim pa organize the five faculties and five powers in parallel sequence: faith countering doubt, diligence countering laziness, mindfulness countering forgetfulness, concentration countering distraction, wisdom countering ignorance. The dbye ba framework distinguishes faculties as seeds and powers as matured capacities.

[2923-2937] <philology>
The term dbang po (faculty) carries its Abhidharma sense of controlling capacities. The compound stobs (power) indicates strength to dominate opposing forces. Instrumental particles function as agency markers. Causative constructions establish relationships between cultivation and maturation.

[2938-2952] <context>
Citations from Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, and Nyi zla kha sbyor establish doctrinal validity. The zhes so formula indicates transmission lineage. The faculties and powers represent the common Mahāyāna foundation that Atiyoga integrates.

[2953-2955]
. Seven factors of enlightenment and noble eightfold path.

[2953-2955] <concept>
The seven factors of enlightenment (byang chub kyi yan lag bdun) and noble eightfold path ('phags lam yan lag brgyad) represent the culmination of gradual path practices within Dzogchen framework. The operational logic demonstrates cause, method, result structure adapted to Great Perfection sensibilities.

[2956-2966] <structure>
The passage demonstrates systematic presentation. Structural markers rim pa organize the seven factors: mindfulness, discrimination of dharmas, diligence, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. The eightfold path follows: right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration.

[2967-2981] <philology>
The term byang chub kyi yan lag (enlightenment factor) carries its classical Buddhist sense. The compound 'phags lam (noble path) indicates the aryan path transcending ordinary existence. Instrumental particles function as means indicators. Causative constructions establish operational relationships.

[2982-2996] <context>
Citations from Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, and Nyi zla kha sbyor establish doctrinal validity within bka' ma tradition. These practices represent the complete gradual path that Dzogchen encompasses within direct recognition.

[2994-3004] <structure>
The passage demonstrates Longchenpa's systematic presentation, establishing the graduated pedagogical approach of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (byang chub kyi phyogs kyi chos sum bcu rtsa bdun).
