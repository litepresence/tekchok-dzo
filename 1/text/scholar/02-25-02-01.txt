. Three kayas and mandala architecture: pure realm cosmology.

[16329-16351] <structure>
This section presents detailed exposition of the three kayas (sku gsum) and their mandala architecture. The structure delineates Sambhogakaya (longs spyod rdzogs sku) and Nirmanakaya (sprul sku) manifestations with their respective fields (zhing) and retinues ('khor). The passage follows the Nyingma systematic presentation of pure realm cosmology, moving from the architectural layout through specific deities to the underlying wisdom principles. The organizational markers (rim pa, dbye ba) indicate graduated pedagogical approach, while the detailed enumeration of mandala components demonstrates the comprehensive nature of the presentation.

This section participates in Nyingma doxographical discourse, delineating pure realm architecture (zhing khams) and Buddha-field cosmology. The presentation draws from Guhyagarbha (gSang ba snying po) and related tantric sources, synthesizing creation-phase (bskyed rim) and completion-phase (rdzogs rim) views. The mandala architecture reflects the Nyingma integration of Indian tantric systems with Tibetan developments. The citation formulas (zhes so, de las gsungs pa) establish textual authority through tantric source validation, demonstrating Longchenpa's synthetic methodology.

The term sku gsum (three kayas) carries its technical Buddhist sense of the three bodies of Buddha: Dharmakaya (chos sku), Sambhogakaya (longs sku), and Nirmanakaya (sprul sku). The compound longs spyod rdzogs sku (complete enjoyment body) indicates the body that enjoys the Dharma and appears to Bodhisattvas. The term sprul sku (emanation body) refers to the forms that manifest to benefit ordinary beings. The particle usage (kyis, las) determines philosophical readings: instrumental particles indicate means of manifestation, while ablative particles indicate source. The term zhing khams (field/realm) carries the sense of Buddha-field (buddhaksetra) where enlightened activity occurs.

The conceptual framework advances understanding of the three kayas as emanation architecture: Dharmakaya as the ultimate nature (chos nyid), Sambhogakaya as the luminous display (gsal ba'i snang ba), and Nirmanakaya as the compassionate manifestation (thugs rje'i 'phrin las). The five family (rigs lnga) mandala organization reflects the transformation of five poisons into five wisdoms. Natural luminosity (rang 'od gsal) serves as the display basis (snang gzhi) for all mandala appearances. The concept of zhing (field) indicates that these are not merely symbolic representations but actual dimensions of enlightened manifestation accessible through practice.

. Dharmakaya pure realm: Samantabhadra and consort in the center.

[16352-16378] <structure>
This subsection presents the Dharmakaya dimension of the mandala: Samantabhadra (Kun tu bzang po) and consort (Kun tu bzang mo) in the center, representing the union of ultimate nature and luminous display. The structure moves from the central deity pair through their specific characteristics to their symbolic significance. The presentation follows the Nyingma schema where Dharmakaya is not formless absence but the ground of all appearance.

[16352-16378] <context>
The depiction of Samantabhadra and consort reflects the Nyingma understanding of primordial Buddha (dang po'i sangs rgyas) as the source of all manifestation. The union (yab yum) represents the non-duality of emptiness (stong pa nyid) and compassion (thugs rje), or space (dbyings) and awareness (rig pa). This presentation draws from the Atiyoga tantras, particularly those of the instruction class (man ngag sde), where the primordial state is depicted as enlightened from the beginning (ye nas sangs rgyas).

[16352-16378] <philology>
The term Kun tu bzang po (Samantabhadra/All-Good) carries the sense of primordial purity in which all qualities are complete. The compound yab yum (Father-Mother) represents the union of method (thabs) and wisdom (shes rab), or the two aspects of enlightened mind. The term chos sku (Dharmakaya) here refers not merely to the formless ultimate but to the manifestation of that ultimate in visionary form. The particle 'i indicates possession or relationship, marking the deities as the embodiment (sku) of Dharma (chos).

[16352-16378] <concept>
The philosophical architecture here presents the ground (gzhi) as already enlightened: Samantabhadra represents awareness (rig pa) and his consort represents the expanse (dbyings), their union representing the non-dual nature of mind. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that Buddhahood is not achieved but recognized—Samantabhadra is the symbol of that recognition. The center (dkyil) of the mandala represents the heart (snying po) where this recognition occurs. The concept of ye nas sangs rgyas (primordially enlightened) indicates that enlightenment is the ground, not the path or result.
