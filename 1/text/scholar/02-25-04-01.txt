. Dharmakāya field: essence, divisions, and definitive terminology.

[16409-16424] <structure>
This section presents the extensive explanation of Dharmakāya field (chos sku'i zhing) organized into four aspects: essence (ngo bo), divisions (dbye ba), enumerations (grangs), and extensive explanation (rgyas par bshad pa). The essence is further analyzed into five aspects: abiding manner (gnas tshul), defining characteristic (mtshan nyid), nature (rang bzhin), compassion (thugs rje), and appearance manner (snang tshul). This fivefold analysis follows the standard Nyingma presentation of the ground (gzhi) as the basis for all manifestation. The structure then presents definitive terminology (nges tshig), divisions (dbye ba), and enumerations.

The presentation of Dharmakāya field participates in Nyingma doxographical discourse, drawing from Guhyagarbha (gSang ba snying po) and related tantric sources. The synthesis of creation-phase (bskyed rim) and completion-phase (rdzogs rim) views is evident: Dharmakāya is presented both as the ultimate nature beyond form and as the source from which all forms arise. The fivefold analysis (abiding manner through appearance manner) reflects the comprehensive Nyingma understanding of Dharmakāya—not as mere emptiness but as the ground of all appearance.

The term chos sku (Dharmakāya) combines chos (dharma/phenomena) and sku (body/form), indicating the body of ultimate reality. The compound rang byung ye shes (self-arisen wisdom) distinguishes Dharmakāya from constructed states. The phrase stong gsal (empty-clear) captures the unity of emptiness and clarity. The term spros bral (free from elaboration) indicates transcendence of all conceptual constructs. The phrase ngo bo (essence) refers to the fundamental nature, while rang bzhin (nature) refers to its inherent qualities. The term thugs rje (compassion) here refers not to emotional empathy but to the inherent capacity to manifest. The particle ni serves a topicalizing function, introducing each of the five aspects.

The philosophical architecture here is foundational to Dzogchen: Dharmakāya is not a place or entity but the nature of reality itself—self-arisen wisdom that is empty yet clear, free from elaboration yet spontaneously present. The five aspects form a coherent whole: essence abides unstained from beginning (ka dag), defining characteristic is emptiness possessing awareness (stong pa nyid rig pa'i ngo bo can), nature is non-mixed with anything (cir yang ma bsres), compassion is without opening or closing (bye ba med pa), appearance manner is non-dual (gnyis su med pa). This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the ground is complete with all qualities from the beginning.

. Definitive terminology and divisions of Dharmakāya.

[16425-16435] <structure>
This subsection presents the definitive terminology (nges tshig) of Dharmakāya: "Maturation from labeled enumeration dharmas into kāya—thus without entity, Defining characteristic nowhere determined, Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called 'Dharmakāya.'" The structure then distinguishes chos (dharma) as Buddha-ground's stainless dharmas connected with awareness, and sku (kāya) as marks and signs without face or hands referring to unchanging awareness-essence. The three divisions follow: Dharmakāya connected with entity-defining characteristics, with abiding-all-pervading manner, and with divisions-appearance manner.

[16425-16435] <context>
The etymological analysis of Dharmakāya reflects the Nyingma hermeneutical approach: terms are not arbitrary labels but indicate the nature of reality. The explanation that Dharmakāya is "without entity" (dngos po med pa), "defining characteristic nowhere determined" (mtshan nyid gang du'ang ma nges), and "emptiness nowhere established" (stong pa gang du'ang ma grub) reflects the Madhyamaka view adapted to Dzogchen—the ultimate is not a thing but the nature of all things. The three divisions indicate different aspects or modes of Dharmakāya: as it is in itself, as it pervades all, and as it appears.

The term nges tshig (definitive terminology) indicates the precise semantic definition. The phrase btags pa'i grangs kyi chos (labeled enumeration dharmas) refers to conceptual constructs. The verb smin pa (mature/ripen) indicates transformation—not that Dharmakāya is produced but that conceptual dharmas mature into recognition of kāya. The term dngos po (entity/substance) indicates reified existence that Dharmakāya transcends. The compound mtshan dpe (marks and examples) refers to the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a Buddha, here interpreted non-physically. The particle zhes bya ba (thus called) marks definitive nomenclature.

[16425-16435] <concept>
The philosophical sophistication here is crucial: Dharmakāya is not a body in the ordinary sense but "marks and signs without face or hands" (zhal phyag med pa'i mtshan dpe)—the metaphorical "body" of ultimate reality. The concept of smin pa (maturation) indicates that Dharmakāya is not achieved but recognized when conceptual constructs mature into wisdom. The three divisions—entity-defining characteristics (dngos po mtshan nyid), abiding-all-pervading manner (gnas pa kun khyab kyi tshul), divisions-appearance manner (dbye ba snang tshul)—indicate that Dharmakāya can be approached from different angles: as empty essence, as pervasive ground, and as manifesting appearance. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the ultimate is not monolithic but has multiple dimensions all co-present.
