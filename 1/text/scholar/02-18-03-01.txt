Technical Yogic and Meditative Doctrines
**Analysis:** The content presents technical instructions for subtle body practices (*rtsa rlung*), meditative absorption (*bsam gtan*), and yogic conduct (*rnal 'byor spyod pa*). These demonstrate the integration of Anuyoga completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) methodologies within the Great Perfection framework. The operational logic—cause, method, result—reflects the standard Buddhist *lam rim* structure adapted to Dzogchen sensibilities.
