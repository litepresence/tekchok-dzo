Citation from *kun tu bzang po klong drug pa'i rgyud*:
- Hey mahasattva
- Mind's abode is alaya
- Why? Alaya gathers all contemplation objects, known as mind
- Ye shes's abode is dharmakaya
- Why? Dharmakaya lacks all memory-conceptualization, no different-object-holding knowing

**Summary:** Page 407 completes the fourth lamp with its simile, concludes the four-lamps section, and inaugurates the second major division on supported cognition. The alaya-dharmakaya distinction establishes the fundamental ground for understanding samsara-nirvana differentiation.

Polemical Analysis: Alaya as Dharmakaya?
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses the erroneous view (*'dod pa*) that identifies alaya with dharmakaya. This view has proponents among:
1. Common treatises (*thun mong gi bstan bcos*): Alaya as support of pure-impure all; dharmakaya as pure's stainless thusness
2. Some mantra practitioners (*sngags kha cig*): Alaya transformed abode becomes dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body

Scriptural citations used to support this view:
- "Alaya is all's basis / nirvana's basis mother also is"
- "Alaya transformed abode is dharmadhatu wisdom, essence body"

[17387-17406] <concept>
Logical Refutation (*gnod pa*):
If alaya were dharmakaya, two absurd consequences (*thal ba*) follow:
1. Dharmakaya would be stained (*dri ma can du thal*)
2. Alaya producing container-world delusion would mean dharmakaya produces delusion

Further absurdity: If accepted, buddhas would again become sentient beings (*sangs rgyas nas slar sems can du 'khrul par thal ba*)

Scriptural refutations (*lung gis gnod*):
- *kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long*: "Considering alaya as dharmakaya is deviating from me"
- *rig pa rang shar*: "Some consider alaya as dharmakaya / To give answer, teaching established / Alaya's characteristic thus / Then that spoke answer / All complete therefore alaya / From that all complete / Buddha becoming sentient being reason / Why all complete / Intermittent possessor becomes / Why various arises / Sometimes buddha becomes / Sometimes sentient being becomes / Why definite abiding / Then asked words reversed / Then if alaya nonexistent / Then asked answer given / Alaya conceptualization holder / Various delusion knowing stained / Alaya ignorance entity is"

[17420-17447] <concept>
Essential Distinction (*dbye dgos*) and Simile:
The distinction is essential. From *klong drug pa*: "Therefore alaya and dharmakaya not distinguished: like form one different-holding knowing, cannot appear objects individually."

Simile: Ocean and boat (*rgya mtsho dang gru*):
- Dharmakaya: Like pure ocean, rigpa unstained never experienced stain, sphere ocean clear, nowhere established, nowhere not arising, door not ceased, primordial field nature pure, adventitious stain separated, that sphere force-place obtained, pure twofold-possessing part
- Alaya: Like boat on ocean not dissolved, when deluded from primordial sphere, ground ignorance all's support, pervader, essence abiding boat-like, mind mental factors action latencies delusion many filled

The *rang shar* citation (17436-17439):
- Alaya and dharmakaya's example
- Ocean and boat's manner path-arisen
- Sleep and waking manner
- Faculty distinction possessing

[17440-17447] <concept>
Fundamental Asymmetry:
Rigpa unstained dharmakaya's essence at all times not reversing, exists as final liberation basis. Alaya like sleep, delusion-appearance all dreams' basis became, must be awakened from—distinction extremely great.

Sleep and dream must be reversed; self-rigpa need not be reversed. Dharmakaya is basis to be recognized; familiarized in that state; fruition liberation place identified. Alaya and dependent dharmas are to be purified stains.

---

**Summary:** Page 408 presents Longchenpa's refutation of the alaya-dharmakaya identity view, using logical consequences and scriptural citations. The ocean-boat simile illustrates the fundamental asymmetry between the unstained ground and the deluded support.

# Expanded Explanation of Alaya and Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation (*rgyas par bshad pa*) in two sections:
1. Alaya expanded explanation
2. Dharmakaya expanded explanation

**Alaya Structure (17451-17476):**
From *thal 'gyur*:
- Alaya and dharmakaya vital point
- Alaya briefly explained
- Dharmas and non-dharmas all's basis
- Essence word distinction with
- Essence latencies vessel
- Classification: body, connection, various, primordial basis

Fivefold analysis of alaya:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*): Compounded virtue, samsara dharmas, latencies with, vessel
2. Definition (*nges tshig*): All-pervading (*kun mang*), gathered, many's time-place or support basis abiding
3. Classification (*dbye ba*):
   - *ye don gyi kun gzhi* (Primordial meaning alaya)
   - *sbyor ba don gyi kun gzhi* (Connection meaning alaya)
   - *bag chags lus kyi kun gzhi* (Latency body alaya)
   - *bag chags sna tshogs pa'i kun gzhi* (Latency various alaya)

[17477-17493] <concept>
Four Alayas Detailed:
1. **Primordial meaning alaya**: Samsara dharmas all's sphere first basis; investigating doer first movement rigpa considering, coeminent ignorance, from reversal spoken
2. **Connection meaning alaya**: That knowing itself self ignorance, samsara connection; knowing, nirvana connection aspect spoken
3. **Latency body alaya**: Root knowing itself body latencies possessing; flesh, blood, light, mind-body arising aspect spoken
4. **Latency various alaya**: That knowing itself impure action latencies source, all's basis making aspect spoken

Though four names, one knowing's aspect four distinctions turned, labeled.

[17494-17507] <concept>
Alaya as Eight Consciousnesses:
From first movement until now, all knowing's support alaya, dependent aggregates eight abiding; individually distinguished, root samsara basis-opening arising basis: primordial meaning and samsara-nirvana connection; body appearing as body; mind latencies dependent alaya basis established. That time knowing's aspect outer-inner not severed, alaya consciousness labeled.

From that, five faculties' respective knowing concept-free five objects holding aspect: five sense-consciousnesses (*sgo lnga'i rnam shes*) labeled.

That time concept-investigation inward-looking realization first that met, mind knowing (*yid shes*), investigating distinguishes specifically holding, object as desired—one mind different aspects known.

Functions (*byed las*):
- Primordial delusion basis makes
- Connection body-mind linked happiness-suffering all-connection makes
- Body body and that aggregates many conditions makes
- Latencies action and afflictions maturation cause-condition makes

Names-entry reasons (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*):
- Latencies prior-later intermediate
- Action karmic result five outer connection
- Cause-result joining
- All-connection binding makes
- Therefore "kun gzhi" word entry

---

**Summary:** Page 409 provides the expanded explanation of alaya with its fivefold analysis (essence, definition, classification, function, name-entry). The four alayas map different aspects of the deluded basis across ground, connection, body, and latencies.

# Dharmakaya Expanded Explanation
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the expanded explanation of dharmakaya (*chos sku rgyas par bshad pa*) following the same fivefold structure:
1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Function (*byed las*)
5. Name-entry reason (*sgras 'jug pa'i rgyu mtshan*)

From *thal 'gyur* (17511-17522):
- Dharmakaya elaboration-free
- Self grasping marks nonexistent
- Essence empty-luminous nondual
- Classification: dharma, longs, sprul
- Three distinctions superior enters
- Definition: dharma true path
- Body from that accomplished
