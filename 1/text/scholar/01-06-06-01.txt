# Fivefold Classification of Experience: From Joy to Emptiness
**Analysis:** This passage presents a pentadic (*lnga pa*) classification of meditative experiences bridging the Four Joys (*dga' ba bzhi*) and the *lhan cig skyes pa* (co-emergent) tradition. The structure employs the ordinal-genitive pattern (*dang po*, *gnyis pa*, etc.) + substantive + classification marker (*ces bya*, *ces so*). The progression: (1) Joy only (*dga' ba tsam nyid*)—limitation; (2) Feeling experience (*tshor ba myong reg*)—sensory contact; (3) Bliss itself (*bde ba nyid*)—refinement; (4) Co-emergent experience (*myong bas lhan cig skyes*)—non-duality; (5) Emptiness (*stong pa nyid*)—ultimate nature. This represents a five-stage phenomenology of meditative experience within the Four Convictions framework.

**Analysis:** The particle *tsam nyid* (only/merely) in *dga' ba tsam nyid* marks limitation—joy that is merely joy without further refinement. The compound *tshor ba myong reg* combines *tshor ba* (feeling/sensation, one of the five aggregates), *myong* (to experience/taste), and *reg* (contact/touch)—indicating the *sparsa* (contact) dimension of experience. The emphatic *nyid* in *bde ba nyid* (bliss itself) marks essential identity—bliss as such without admixture. The instrumental *myong bas* (by/through experiencing) indicates that co-emergence (*lhan cig skyes*) is achieved through or as the culmination of experience. The quotative *ces bya* (called/named) versus *ces so* (thus called) distinguishes definitional assertions from enumerative conclusions.

**Analysis:** This fivefold schema integrates multiple tantric classification systems: the Four Joys (*dga' ba bzhi*) as stages of bliss; the *skye mched* (sense-bases) phenomenology of contact and feeling; and the *lhan cig skyes* (co-emergent/sahaja) tradition of natural, spontaneous presence. The progression from "joy only" to "emptiness" represents the *rnam grol lam* (liberation path) structure: coarse bliss → subtle feeling → essential bliss → co-emergent wisdom → emptiness. The enumeration concludes with the twelfth (*bcu gnyis pa*) point—viewing that itself and applying the crucial point of change—indicating this is part of a larger twelve-point system within the Four Convictions chapter, correlating with the twelve links of dependent origination or the twelve aspects of the four truths.

**Analysis:** This pentadic schema maps the progression from ordinary pleasure to ultimate emptiness: (1) *Dga' ba tsam*—ordinary conditioned joy; (2) *Tshor ba*—sensory affect that perpetuates saṃsāra; (3) *Bde ba nyid*—unconditioned bliss of refined practice; (4) *Lhan cig skyes*—co-emergent wisdom where bliss and emptiness arise together without duality; (5) *Stong pa nyid*—ultimate nature free from all characteristics. This represents the *rnam par dag pa lnga* (five purifications) or *sbyong ba lnga* (five trainings) structure. The "crucial point of change" (*'gyur ba rtsi ba*) refers to recognizing the transition between these states—the moment of transformation (*'gyur ba*) wherein ordinary experience becomes wisdom. This is the *gnad* (crucial point) instruction: recognizing the *'gyur* (change) without becoming attached to any stage.
