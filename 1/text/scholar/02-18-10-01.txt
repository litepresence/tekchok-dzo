. The passage employs enumerative logic (eight like-similes) and causal explanations (cause is.../phyir ro).

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5092]: rlung nyams (wind experience): technical term for energetic/visionary instability in subtle body practice. snang cha (vision part/aspect): indicates these are components of larger visionary taxonomy.

: 'ja' lus (rainbow body): manifestation of realization as light-form. sku gsum (three kāyas): dharmakāya (chos sku), sambhogakāya (longs sku), nirmāṇakāya (sprul sku). rig 'dzin (vidyādhara): awareness-holder, five types enumerated.

[CONTEXT] This material situates within the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) framework of the Tögal path, the result vehicle (Dzogchen) completion practice. The technical terms derive from the Bla ma yang thig, Mthong ba don ldan, and other seminal Dzogchen tantras. The passage represents Longchenpa's systematic presentation of the stageless stages—though Dzogchen transcends gradualism, the four visions provide a descriptive framework for recognition. The "original abiding" (ye bzhugs) terminology distinguishes this from constructed meditation states (bcos ma).

[CONCEPT]
• Four visions taxonomy:
  - Dharmatā vision (chos nyid snang ba): direct manifestation of nature-of-things
  - Increasing experience (nyams gong 'phel): visions multiply and intensify
  - Awareness reaching full measure (rig pa tshad phebs): complete recognition
  - Exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad pa): phenomena liberated into their ground

• Spatial metaphors:
  - Self-light expanse (rang 'od kyi klong): dimension of natural luminosity
  - Wisdom palace (ye shes kyi pho brang): residence of primordial knowing
  - Great spontaneous completion (lhun grub chen po): uncontrived perfection

• Teleology:
  - Three kāyas actualization through vision practice
  - Five vidyādhara attainments
  - Rainbow body ('ja' lus) as somatic marker of realization

: rgyan drug (six ornaments): decorative visionary phenomena—sgra (sound), 'od (light), thig le (spheres), sku (bodies), yid 'ong (attractive), grol (liberation). chos sku'i rgyan (dharmakāya ornaments): ultimate nature appearances.

Line

[5136-5140]
: zung 'jug (union): integration of appearance-emptiness, bliss-emptiness, awareness-emptiness. gzhi (ground/basis): primordial state preceding samsara-nirvana bifurcation. gdangs (resonance/radiance): self-display of awareness without external cause.

[CONTEXT] The six ornaments (rgyan drug) derive from tantric classification systems, particularly the Guhyagarbha and Māyājāla cycles, adapted for Dzogchen presentation. The distinction between inner and outer vision (nang phyir snang) reflects epistemological debates in Tibetan Buddhism about the status of meditative experiences—are they purely subjective (nang) or do they possess objective ontological status (phyir)? Longchenpa's position affirms the non-dual nature of these appearances as self-display (rang snang) of awareness, neither purely inner nor outer.

[CONCEPT]
• Six ornaments phenomenology:
  - Sounds: dharmatā resonance (chos nyid kyi sgra)
  - Lights: five-colored radiance (lnga ldan gyi 'od)
  - Spheres (thig le): concentrated luminosity
  - Bodies (sku): manifestation of three kāyas
  - Attractive (yid 'ong): naturally pleasing without attachment
  - Liberation (grol): self-liberated upon arising

• Threefold union (zung 'jug):
  - Appearance-emptiness union (snang stong zung 'jug)
  - Bliss-emptiness union (bde stong zung 'jug)
  - Awareness-emptiness union (rig stong zung 'jug)

• Vision maturation stages:
  - Increasing ('phel): quantitative multiplication
  - Arriving at measure (tshad phebs): qualitative fullness
  - Self-liberation (rang grol): automatic purification

[CONTEXT] This page contains the classical presentation of the four visions (snang ba bzhi) that defines Tögal practice. The schema derives from the Thod rgal section of the Snying thig ya bzhi and Longchenpa's own Mthong ba don ldan commentary. The progression mirrors the classical Buddhist stages of insight but reconceived within Dzogchen's spontaneous framework: (1) recognition of nature (chos nyid), (2) maturation through repetition (nyams gong 'phel), (3) complete measurement (tshad phebs), (4) exhaustion into ground (chos zad). Each vision builds on the previous while representing distinct qualitative shifts in perception.

[CONCEPT]
• Four visions progressive schema:
  1. Dharmatā vision: Initial recognition, like recognizing one's face in mirror
  2. Increasing experience: Visions multiply spontaneously, like stars filling sky
  3. Awareness at full measure: Complete non-dual recognition, like illusion
  4. Exhaustion of phenomena: Liberation into ground, like dreams dissolving

• Characteristics of each:
  - First: Natural (rang byung), uncontrived (ma bcos)
  - Second: Increasing ('phel), expansive (rgyas pa)
  - Third: Measure complete (tshad phebs), illusion-like (sgyu ma lta bu)
  - Fourth: Elaboration ceased (spros pa zad), spontaneously complete (lhun grub)

• Teleological structure:
  - Progressive yet non-gradual (rim pa yin yang cig car)
  - Each stage contains previous yet transcends it
  - Culmination in "beyond practice" (sgom pa las 'das)
