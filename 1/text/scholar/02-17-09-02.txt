. Four right exertions: the dynamic of virtue cultivation.

[3198-3205] <context>
The passage cites authoritative tantric sources establishing doctrinal validity for the four samyakpradhānas (yang dag spong ba bzhi). These exertions represent the classical Buddhist path of virtue cultivation that Dzogchen integrates without supplanting. The zhes so formula indicates transmission lineage within bka' ma tradition. The four exertions form the dynamic framework for transforming mind through deliberate engagement with virtue and non-virtue.

The term yang dag spong ba (right exertion/samya-pradhāna) carries its Abhidharma technical sense. The compound mi dge ba (non-virtue) encompasses the ten non-virtues and their branches. The term skye ba med pa (not arisen) and skyes pa (arisen) distinguish between latent and manifest non-virtue. The particle gis indicates the instrumental means by which exertion operates. The causative construction 'gog pa (prevent/suppress) establishes the active nature of these practices.

The passage demonstrates Longchenpa's systematic presentation through the fourfold dynamic: (1) preventing non-virtue not yet arisen (mi dge ba ma skyes pa mi bskyed), (2) abandoning non-virtue already arisen (mi dge ba skyes pa spang), (3) generating virtue not yet arisen (dge ba ma skyes pa bskyed), (4) maintaining virtue already arisen (dge ba skyes pa gzhir 'dzin). This structure mirrors the progressive logic of the path: prevention → abandonment → generation → maintenance.

[3198-3205] <concept>
The operational logic—cause (ordinary distracted state with arising/ceasing virtue/non-virtue), method (appropriate exertion), result (purification and accumulation)—integrates standard Buddhist practice within Great Perfection framework. The key Dzogchen insight: these exertions are not ultimately necessary for recognition but are indispensable as preparatory practices. The concept of yang dag (right/correct) indicates alignment with ultimate reality, not merely conventional morality.

. Four bases of miraculous power: transcendence of ordinary limitations.

[3206-3227] <structure>
The passage demonstrates systematic presentation of the four rdzu 'phrul gyi rkang pa (bases of miraculous power). Structural markers rim pa organize: aspiration (dun pa), effort (brtson 'grus), mind (sems), investigation (dpyod pa). The dbye ba distinguishes each by its specific quality: aspiration overcomes doubt, effort overcomes laziness, mind overcomes distraction, investigation overcomes ignorance. This fourfold structure reflects the classical Abhidharma presentation.

Citations from Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, and Nyi zla kha sbyor establish doctrinal authority. The four bases represent the foundation for abhijñā (mngon shes/superknowledges) that support both practice and benefiting beings. The zhes so formula indicates these are transmitted teachings within bka' ma lineage. In the Dzogchen context, these bases become supports for recognizing the natural capacities of mind rather than ends in themselves.

[3206-3227] <philology>
The term rdzu 'phrul (miraculous power) refers to abilities that transcend ordinary physical and mental limitations. The compound rkang pa (basis/leg) metaphorically indicates that these four qualities support higher attainments—like legs support the body. The term dun pa (aspiration) carries the sense of confident intent toward liberation. The compound brtson 'grus (diligence/effort) indicates sustained application. The term dpyod pa (investigation/analysis) refers to discriminative wisdom examining phenomena.

[3206-3227] <concept>
The bases become supports for recognition rather than ends in themselves. In the Dzogchen view, miraculous powers are not supernatural acquisitions but natural expressions of mind's inherent capacities when obscurations are removed. The concept of rdzu 'phrul indicates spontaneity—these powers manifest naturally when the bases are stabilized. The four bases counter the four māras: aspiration countering death-māra, effort countering affliction-māra, mind countering aggregate-māra, investigation countering god-māra.
