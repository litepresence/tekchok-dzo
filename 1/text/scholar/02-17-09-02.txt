. Four right exertions: prevention, abandonment, generation, maintenance.

[3198-3205] <context>
The passage cites authoritative tantric sources establishing doctrinal validity for the four samyakpradhānas (yang dag spong ba bzhi). The zhes so formula indicates transmission lineage within bka' ma tradition. These exertions represent the effortful phase of practice that Dzogchen practitioners engage before effortless recognition.

[3202-3212] <structure>
The passage demonstrates Longchenpa's systematic presentation. Structural markers rim pa organize the four exertions: preventing non-virtue not yet arisen, abandoning non-virtue already arisen, generating virtue not yet arisen, maintaining virtue already arisen. The graduated approach reflects Buddhist lam rim structure adapted to Dzogchen.

[3206-3201] <concept>
The operational logic—cause (ordinary distracted state with arising/ceasing virtue/non-virtue), method (appropriate exertion), result (purification and accumulation)—integrates standard Buddhist practice within Great Perfection framework. The content demonstrates that Dzogchen does not reject effort but recognizes its provisional necessity.

[3213-3227] <philology>
Key technical terms require philological precision. The term spong ba (abandonment/exertion) carries its Abhidharma technical sense. Instrumental particles (-kyis, -gis) function as agency markers. Causative constructions establish operational relationships between effort and result. The compound dge chos (virtue) and mi dge chos (non-virtue) follow standard terminology with Dzogchen semantic extensions toward natural spontaneity.

[3239-3249] <structure>
The passage demonstrates systematic presentation. Structural markers rim pa organize the four bases: aspiration (dun pa), effort (brtson 'grus), mind (sems), investigation (dpyod pa). The dbye ba distinguishes each by its specific quality that overcomes hindrances.

The operational logic demonstrates integration of standard Buddhist practice within Great Perfection. The bases become supports for recognition rather than ends in themselves.

[3250-3264] <philology>
The term rdzu 'phrul (miraculous power) carries its technical sense of abilities that transcend ordinary limitations. The compound rkang pa (basis/leg) metaphorically indicates the foundation upon which powers stand. Instrumental particles indicate how each basis serves as antidote to specific obscuration.

[3265-3279] <context>
