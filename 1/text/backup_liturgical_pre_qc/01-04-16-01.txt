[3766] <prose> The first is explained:
[3767] <prose> The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature.
[3768] <prose> The abiding is self-purified.
[3769] <prose> When divided:
[3770] <list> Ocean Space and
[3771] <list> Sky Space—these two.
[3772] <prose> The essence of Ocean Space, eternally self-liberated beyond extremes,
[3773] <prose> Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself.
[3774] <prose> Without the two extremes of multiplicity.
[3775] <prose> These divide into two: || 10 ||
[3776] <list> Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.
[3777] <prose> The first is explained:
[3778] <prose> Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated,
[3779] <prose> When relied upon, mind-emptiness is thoroughly purified,
[3780] <prose> The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible,
[3781] <prose> Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty—
[3782] <prose> By emptiness, nowhere is anything established—this is the intent.
[3783] <prose> The Small Ocean Space:
[3784] <prose> Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain,
[3785] <prose> Through the particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible—this is the intent. || 20 ||
[3786] <prose> The essence of Sky Space:
[3787] <prose> Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated.
[3788] <prose> When divided, these are two:
[3789] <list> Sun-Moon Space and
[3790] <list> Jewel White Space—these two.
[3791] <prose> The first is explained:
[3792] <prose> The essence is utterly pure emptiness,
[3793] <prose> Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated.
[3794] <prose> The second is explained:
[3795] <break> <prose> Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified, || 30 ||
[3796] <break> <prose> Moreover, through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā is spontaneously accomplished—this is the intent regarding causes and conditions.
[3797] <prose> The essence of the Infinite Space expanse, when appearing to the mind, is known,
[3798] <prose> When not appearing, it is known by the mode of abiding.
[3799] <prose> When divided, there are three:
[3800] <list> The Outer Infinite Space free from action,
[3801] <list> The Inner Infinite Space of the view's own position,
[3802] <list> The Secret Infinite Space of radiance and obstacle-removal,
[3803] <list> The Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.
[3804] <prose> The first is explained:
[3805] <prose> Through causelessness, no reversal—this is the key point, || 40 ||
[3806] <prose> Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—this is the key point,
[3807] <prose> Through the absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nowhere established—this is the key point.
[3808] <prose> Also, through uncontrivance toward the mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-saṃsāra.
[3809] <prose> Through mind without cause-sign, the non-dual object of desire.
[3810] <prose> The second is explained:
[3811] <prose> Through not relying on the eight vehicles, the exertion of progression is abandoned,
[3812] <prose> Though appearances arise in manifold forms, liberation comes from the one—not-ceased self-nature arising, so it is called.
[3813] <prose> That also, the ultimate of the Great Perfection's accomplishment:
[3814] <prose> Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising,
[3815] <prose> Whatever is not rejected is completely perfected, || 50 ||
[3816] <prose> The basis of all phenomena, in whatever direction, is not exceeded.
[3817] <prose> Dharmatā arising in manifold forms, even in India, is not exhausted.
[3818] <prose> The third is explained:
[3819] <prose> Appearance, when drawn into mind, the rays of self-awareness clearly manifest,
[3820] <prose> Appearance not rejected, completely perfected,
[3821] <prose> Consequently, the rays of mind's continuity, through recollection and meditation clearly manifest—recollection and meditation perfected in dharmatā, thus continuity emptied and purified, so it is called.
[3822] <prose> Perception and awareness entering, through severance of non-dual connection, saṃsāra's essence is completely liberated, so it is called.
[3823] <prose> The Great Perfection of self-arising desire:
[3824] <list> Through view being non-existent, beyond conceptual imputation,
[3825] <list> Through meditation being non-existent, without acceptance, rejection, negation, or establishment, || 60 ||
[3826] <list> Through conduct being non-existent, action is liberated in dharmatā,
[3827] <list> Through result being non-existent, non-attainment abides in itself.
[3828] <prose> Among these, when divided:
[3829] <prose> Enumeration is beyond measure.
[3830] <prose> The spreading of key-points—that very suchness's vast compassion:
[3831] <prose> Moreover, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's dharmas, arising in the kāya and jñāna of appearing-awareness, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa wherever not divided—dharmatā, so it is called.
[3832] <prose> That also, through dual proliferation of the non-changing mark and appearing-awareness, saṃsāra is reversed.
[3833] <prose> The key-point of clearly seeing one's own face, through self-and-other proliferation of recollection and meditation, thought is completely purified, so it is called.
[3834] <prose> Through non-existence of outer and inner objects, bliss without concepts, awakening—so it is called.
[3835] <prose> Through freedom from action, mind is beyond, || 70 ||
[3836] <prose> Through self-knowing examination, bliss and suffering have equal taste—so it is called.
[3837] <prose> These too, when gathered, are collected into three.
[3838] <prose> The space free from action, through non-doing, is liberated into the dharmatā of self-liberation—
[3839] <prose> Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation.
[3840] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3841] <prose> The space of ornament:
[3842] <prose> Appearance is the continuity of mind,
[3843] <prose> The ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty, so it is called.
[3844] <prose> Furthermore:
[3845] <prose> Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived. || 80 ||
[3846] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3847] <prose> The space of play:
[3848] <prose> The play without direction, unceasing, arises,
[3849] <prose> The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur, so it is called.
[3850] <prose> Furthermore:
[3851] <prose> For the sake of liberating all into the completely pure path.
[3852] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3853] <prose> The space of dharmatā:
[3854] <prose> Abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not,
[3855] <prose> The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual. || 90 ||
[3856] <prose> Furthermore:
[3857] <prose> The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all.
[3858] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3859] <prose> The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive—is:
[3860] <prose> The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint.
[3861] <prose> This is divided into three:
[3862] <list> Taught in the manner of oral transmission,
[3863] <list> Taught in the manner of symbolic instruction,
[3864] <list> Taught in the manner of self-arisen tantric scripture.
[3865] <prose> Among these, the essence of oral transmission is: || 100 ||
[3866] <prose> The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced.
[3867] <prose> The division:
[3868] <list> The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation,
[3869] <list> The two instructions that manifest the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.
