Essential nature of ye shes (wisdom) as so so rang rig pa (self-knowing awareness) primordially dwelling as omniscient clarity (mkhyen char gnas pa). Definitive term (nges tshig): ye nas gnas pa'i don (meaning of primordial abiding) - not temporal origin but timeless immediacy. Citation from Rang shar establishes wisdom as primordial nature (ye nas rang bzhin lhun gyis grub) spontaneously accomplished. Risk: reifying "primordial" as chronological beginning rather than atemporal ground.

Threefold classification of wisdom of basis-abiding (gZhi gnas kyi ye shes): (1) ngos bo ka dag gi ye shes (wisdom of primordial purity) transcending extremes of existence/non-existence (yod med kyi mtha' las 'das pa), like space (nam mkha' lta bu). Thalgyur citation: ma rig pa (non-awareness) not established as existence or non-existence; one/two numbers non-existent; characteristics nowhere divided. Non-abiding in extremes (mtha' la mi gnas) - self-knowing purity (rang rig dag). Risk: nihilistic interpretation of "no establishment" as ontological denial rather than freedom from conceptual fixation.

(2) rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes (wisdom of spontaneous perfection): primordially complete with qualities (ye nas yon tan rdzogs) - like wish-fulfilling jewel (dod 'byung gi nor bu) arising from ground of potency and manifestation (rtsal dang 'char gzhi). Essence appearing yet empty of entity and characteristics (dngos po dang mtshan mas stong pa). Snang stong 'jug pa (appearance-emptiness engagement) - Buddha and sentient beings as pure objects. Risk: collapsing spontaneous presence into primordial purity, missing rol pa (play) dimension; or reifying qualities as truly existent.

(3) thugs rje kun khyab kyi ye shes (wisdom of all-pervading compassion): without self-face (rang ngor med) yet manifests as root pervading ground of manifestation ('char gzhi). Exhaustless manifold gates of manifestation (mi 'dzad sna tshogs 'char ba'i sgo). Dharmakaya empty nature produces wisdom portion of complete knowledge (ye shes mkhyen pa rdzogs pa'i cha). Compassion as force of nature (rang bzhin shugs kyi thugs rje), not emotional response. Like light from sun, self-possessed without obstruction. Risk: psychologizing compassion as emotional state rather than natural responsiveness (shugs).

Wisdom of characteristic-holding (mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes): five roots (rtsa ba lnga) and twenty-five subdivisions. Five wisdoms from Rang shar: Dharmadhatu wisdom (chos dbyings ye shes) without concept; Mirror-like wisdom (me long ye shes) unceasing clarity; Equality wisdom (mnyam nyid ye shes) complete unmixed; Discriminating wisdom (so rtog ye shes); All-accomplishing wisdom (bya grub ye shes). Pedagogical enumeration providing framework for recognition, not ontological hierarchy. Risk: reifying five wisdoms as separate entities rather than aspects of single ye shes; confusing enumeration with multiplication.

Thalgyur elaboration distinguishing five wisdoms' functions. Mirror-like: shapes and colors complete from reflections (gZugs brnyan), white pure of stains. Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa connection through self-possessed appearances (rang chas snang). Equality: from two equal causes, three equal conditions - without duality, free from class (ris dang bral). Discriminating: sense faculty types, whatever appears as that dharma, each sequence clear - antidote method (gnyen po'i tshul). All-accomplishing: self-ceasing effort, dharmas self-placed self-liberated. Risk: converting wisdom-descriptions into meditation techniques to achieve rather than recognizing spontaneously present qualities.

Compassion portion two wisdoms: wisdom gathered by knowing (shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes) and wisdom gathered by objects of knowledge (shes byas bsdus pa'i ye shes). First: Buddha body and wisdom intention self-clear manifest in Buddhas, subtle essence (phra ba snying po) abiding in sentient beings' hearts. Non-dual pervasion without existing own-nature. Risk: locating wisdom spatially "in" hearts as physical entity rather than intrinsic nature.

Wisdom gathered by objects of knowledge: (a) knowing how much of knowable object-aspects appear (ji snyed pa), all without mixing individually; (b) knowing abiding mode of knowable objects (ji lta ba) like space free from elaboration. Thalgyur citation: knows disciples' thoughts, understands others' benefit, extracts from three realms. Temporal language "first arising" (thog mar byung ba) pedagogical pointer, not chronological. Risk: temporalizing timeless recognition into progressive attainment; converting "measure reached" (tshad du phyin pa) into graduated path.

Twenty-five wisdom subdivision (ye shes nyi shu rtsa lnga) from Vajrasattva heart-mirror citation: five wisdoms each with five aspects. Enumerative framework for understanding display-nature of recognition. Dharmadhatu wisdom, wisdom of dharmadhatu, wisdom of completely pure dharmadhatu, etc. Tantric transformative register providing structured access to unstructured recognition. Risk: proliferating wisdom-entities through mathematical multiplication; mistaking enumeration for ontological complexity.

Detailed enumeration of twenty-five: each of five wisdoms contains dimension-aspect (dbyings), dharmadhatu-aspect, completely pure aspect, suchness aspect (de bzhin nyid), and sameness aspect (mnyam pa nyid). Five times five systematic presentation. Not five separate wisdoms multiplied but single wisdom-display showing twenty-five facets. Risk: reifying subdivisions as separate wisdoms; missing that enumeration serves recognition of non-dual nature, not catalog-building.

Completion of twenty-five enumeration with emphasis on indivisibility. All twenty-five aspects simultaneously present, not sequential achievements. Reference to chos sku (Dharmakaya) nature throughout - wisdom not separate from body of truth. Snang stong zung 'jug (union of appearance-emptiness) as underlying structure. Risk: nihilistic reading of emptiness aspects as denying wisdom-function; or eternalist reading of appearance aspects as affirming inherent existence.

Final classification: wisdom pervading objects (yul la khyab pa'i ye shes) summarized as complete display of recognition-nature. Not consciousness (shes pa) investigating objects but wisdom (ye shes) pervading without obstruction. Distinction between shes bya (objects of knowledge) and shes pa (knowing) dissolved in recognition. All classification ultimately provisional - definitive meaning being wisdom beyond enumeration.
