<classification> Detailed instruction on door-gnad operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Opening: ordinary seeing-mode does not dawn wisdom, therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes. This establishes ordinary perception is not wrong but incomplete; three-kaya seeing-modes are recognition of how awareness has always seen, not new ways to see. Dpal Nam Mkha' Dang Mnyam Pa'i Rgyud citation describes three kayas' functions: (1) Dharmakaya seeing-mode—pressing three realms' samsara, seeing all samsara as already pressed into dharmata; (2) Sambhogakaya—samsara's basis not destroyed, recognition sees without destroying appearances; (3) Nirmanakaya—liberating into buddha-fields, manifestation-liberation. Additional citations: Yi Ge Med Pa—eye examined in space-element; Gsang Ba Sgra Rgyud—three seeing-modes: casting down, turning back, glancing. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of view-collapse: treating three-kaya seeing as visualizations to create rather than recognition of awareness's own seeing. Dzogchen view recognizes modes are not sequential practices but descriptions of how recognition sees—all three kayas simultaneously present.

<classification> Application of three-kaya seeing based on practitioner's eye-quality operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Clarification: casting down Nirmanakaya awakening looks at trainees; glancing at Sambhogakaya awakening looks at realms; turning back Dharmakaya awakening looks at basis. Each kaya-emphasis serves pedagogical purpose: (1) Nirmanakaya casting-down directs gaze downward toward beings needing guidance; (2) Sambhogakaya glancing directs gaze sideways toward pure realms; (3) Dharmakaya turning-back directs gaze inward toward basis. Instruction for different eye-qualities: (1) Poor eye-sight—following Nirmanakaya mode prevents eye-obscuration; (2) Eye-fault—following Sambhogakaya mode makes eye clear; (3) Good eye-sight—following Dharmakaya mode quickly places appearance onto measure. Definitive statement: "If not moving from those, three eyes certainly enter into interior"—without wavering from these modes, recognition occurs. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of reification: treating eye-quality as fixed category rather than recognition-condition. Dzogchen view recognizes "three eyes entering interior" refers to recognition's self-introduction, not physical eye-training.

<classification> Threefold blessing-bestowal structure marks definitive Dzogchen transmission. Through Dharmakaya's blessing, wisdom is directly seen—definite; through Sambhogakaya's blessing, self-clarity is seen—knowledge expands; through Nirmanakaya's blessing, seeing without sound-words—all hearing-contemplating-mediating, dharmata's meaning dawns from within. This is not sequential reception but simultaneous dimensions of single recognition. "Blessing" is not external infusion but collapse of apparent separation between recognizer and recognized: when recognition occurs, not that something new appears but what has always been present is recognized. Three eyes viewing: (1) Dharmata's eye turning upward clears latencies downward—transcending dualistic gaze naturally clears habitual patterns; (2) Wisdom's corner looking evenly balances samsara-nirvana as same taste—recognition sees samsara and nirvana as not two; (3) Prajña's looking downward settles wisdom-appearance—wisdom-display naturally manifests without effort. This is declarative finality. Risk of reification: treating "blessing" as external power transmission rather than recognition of what has always been present.

<classification> Determination of three seeing-modes operates from instructional provisionality for different practitioner capacities. Question: "What makes three definite?" Answer: lazy ones need Sambhogakaya, diligent ones Nirmanakaya, equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture, therefore three are definite. This establishes three seeing-modes are not sequential stages but skillful-means matching practitioner's predominant capacity. Definition: by seeing, looking at dharmata, obscurations are exhausted; by posture, one liberates from samsara. "Obscurations exhausted" refers to recognition-elimination: when recognition sees dharmata, obscurations are not removed but recognized as never having existed. "Liberates from samsara" refers to recognition-liberation: samsara is not exited but recognized as self-liberated display. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of reification: treating lazy, diligent, equanimous as fixed categories rather than recognition-condition descriptions. Dzogchen view recognizes all three seeing-modes point to same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, self-liberated. Three modes are different pedagogical approaches for different patterns, not hierarchical stages.

<classification> Detailed explanation of object-gnad operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Opening: object-gnad is (1) outer expanse's object—empty space free from clouds; (2) inner expanse's object—the treasury between eyebrows—expanse-appearance blue and five radiating from it. Thal Gyur citation: "Expanse is outer and inner—outer holds cloud-free sky; when dust-rain clears, wise ones press the gnad; inner lamp makes path." This establishes structure: (1) Outer object: sky without clouds—pure awareness-expanse; (2) Inner object: lamp between eyebrows—subtle energy focus; (3) "Pressing gnad" occurs when coarse defilements clear, not through effort. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of reification: treating treasury between eyebrows as literal anatomical location rather than recognition-coordinate. Dzogchen view recognizes outer and inner are conventional designations, not separate spaces—both refer to dimensions of single awareness. "Expanse-appearance blue and five radiating" indicates natural display of awareness as five colors, not visualizations to create.

<classification> Definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from rigpa-side pointing to recognition's non-duality. Explanation: outer is object where rigpa dawns, inner is object where experience increases; because rigpa and experience are non-dual, it is called "samsara-nirvana mixed." This establishes outer an
