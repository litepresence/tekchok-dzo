<classification> Bardo states as opportunities for recognition, applying Dzogchen view to transitions between life, death, and rebirth. Six bardos—living, dreaming, meditation, dying, dharmata, becoming—all expressions of ground's spontaneous presence. Recognition in any bardo leads to liberation. Instructional framework for critical transitions.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Six bardos all offering opportunities for recognition, not essentially different from ordinary life. All display of awareness. Bardo of dying and dharmata particularly emphasized as ordinary perception dissolves, revealing natural state. Definitive recognition of bardos as opportunities.

<risk>reification
<classification> Rainbow body as ultimate fruition—complete dissolution of material body into light at death. Not miraculous achievement but natural result of complete recognition. Material body as condensation of subtle elements appearing due to delusion; elements return to natural state as light when delusion dissolved. Risk of reifying rainbow body as goal to achieve rather than natural expression of recognition.
