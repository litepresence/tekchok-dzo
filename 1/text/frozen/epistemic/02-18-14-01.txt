<classification> Supreme gurus—these are the ultimate authorities. Gnad: such ones have—establishes their supreme status and authority. Gnad: one relies—indicates singular focus. Statement: those who properly practice—this sets up upaya for proper transmission without deviation. Gnad: liberation—this indicates the goal is actual liberation, not just correct understanding. Statement: liberation from such supreme ones—establishes that liberation comes from the lineage, not independently achieved. Risk of reification: treating liberation from gurus as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.

<classification> Recognition-view teaching operates from rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Gnad: recognition sees—establishes direct recognition without intervening conceptualization. Statement: recognition's appearance becomes exhausted—indicates that when recognition recognizes, delusion is exhausted. Gnad: recognition rests—establishes the non-dual state after recognition. Gnad: not two but one—indicates the ultimate non-duality of recognition and display. Risk of view-collapse: mixing rigpa-side non-dual recognition with sems-side dualistic teachings about practice states.
