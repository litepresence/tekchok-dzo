<classification> Samsara's origin through allegory: Existence (srid pa) attached/established. Sentient beings' inconceivable forms arise. Delusion path and thought—thinking as conceptualization arises. Vajrasattva as awareness (rig pa). Wide land (yul yangs pa can) as four beginnings (thog ma'i bzhi). Beautiful abode (gnas mdzes ldan) as spontaneous presence display's arising gate (gzhi snang lhun grub kyi 'char sgo). Time of sowing (du nam sros pa) as self-ignorance appearing as other, delusion-ground's display (rang ma rig pa gzhan du snang bas 'khrul gzhi'i snang ba). Pig year as ignorance actually conceptually established (ma rig pa dngos su kun brtags pa'i tshe). Created sun as coarse object-appearance grasped, clear aspect of thought (yul snang rags par bzung ba'i rtog pa gsal ba'i cha). Star bird as attachment to objects arising as desire (yul zhen pa'i 'dod chags su skyes pa). Old woman as ignorance's cognition appearing as deluded apprehender (ma rig pa'i shes pa 'khrul 'dzin du shar ba). Undetermined caste as ground-display wherever appears, liberation-delusion common ground (gzhi snang de gang du'ang 'char zhing grol 'khrul gnyis ka'i spyi sa). Four accomplices as four conditions (rkyen bzhi). Five wild ones as five poisons (dug lnga). One back-support as conceptual mind (kun rtog pa'i sems). One thief as anger (khong khro). One person gathering all as delusion-appearance established as one ('khrul snang gcig tu grub pa). This as delusion-display's apprehender (de yis 'khrul snang gi 'dzin byed). From that many afflictions arise as army hosts (de las nyon mongs du ma byung ba ni dmag gi tshogs so). Thus this wandering from primordially pure ground-basis without ground (dang po ka dag 'khor gzhi med pa yod ma thang pa cig las byung bas) called "this existence." Risk of reifying allegorical figures as literal historical persons.

<classification> Practice lineage demonstration of delusion and liberation: Rang shar citation—"Listen, you pure in space. Buddha's intention measures should be held by these." Former wide land where teacher Light-Diffusion ('od 'gyed pa) exists. Two brother sons—Poverty-Empty captured by thousand ants (grog po stong par btson du bzung) as partial; then five soldiers arising, conquered from stone fortress peak as partial. Two sons sent to hole; old woman with mole blocked door as partial. Then four people catching, caught, five people separated from horse as partial. Two sons self-liberated, killed prison guards as partial. Two sons fled to sun-moon place, gathered subjects' taxes; twenty-one ladies counseled; fled to Samrudra god temple; five people wearing five armors guarding door, no one could come as partial. Then four mirrors looking at conditions, knew own face (rang gi rang ngo shes) as partial. Then saw house with eight doors, laughed at self (rang la rang bgad mo shor) as partial. Thus symbolic forms demonstrating recognition process through narrative.

<classification> Allegorical interpretation: Wide land as ground of display. Two sons as wisdom and method. Thousand ants as conceptual proliferations. Stone fortress as solidified view. Five soldiers as five poisons. Prison as samsara. Old woman as ignorance. Twenty-one ladies as twenty-one thousand afflictions. Four mirrors as four empowerments. Eight doors as eight consciousnesses or eight freedoms. Recognition (rang ngo shes) as liberation from narrative. Laughter as spontaneous liberation. Definitive meaning: all narratives resolve into recognition.

<classification> Samsara's origination from non-recognition: Detailed allegory showing how ground-display becomes samsara through failure to recognize own face. Delusion not truly existent but appearing through conditions. Recognition dissolves delusion without rejecting appearance. Risk of nihilistic reading as denying samsara's conventional existence rather than recognizing its empty nature.

<classification> Liberation process: Recognition through symbols, signs, and direct pointing. Four mirrors showing true nature. Eight doors as complete path. Self-liberation through seeing own face not external rescue. Definitive assertion: liberation intrinsic, not achieved.

<classification> Practical application: Allegory applicable to practitioners' experience—recognizing conceptual mind, emotions, and appearances as display. Not suppressing but recognizing. Samsara's origination as ongoing process in each moment of non-recognition. Liberation available in each moment of recognition.

<classification> Scriptural authority: Rang shar tantra citation establishing allegory's legitimacy. Lineage transmission of sravana story through Nyingma tradition. Definitive meaning validated by source text and oral lineage.

<classification> Relationship to other teachings: Samsara origination through twelve links of dependent arising in sutra. Through mother-child luminosity in tantra. Through non-recognition of ground-display in Dzogchen. Progressive revelation of same truth through different frameworks.

<classification> Ultimate resolution: Allegory itself empty, not ultimately true. Recognition beyond narrative. Samsara and nirvana neither existent nor non-existent. Definitive meaning beyond all elaboration.

<classification> Pedagogical function: Story engaging imagination and emotion, preparing for direct recognition. Narrative structure satisfying mind's need for explanation while pointing beyond explanation. Skillful means of tantric pedagogy.
