Bardo and liberation-delusion signs (bar do dang phyis ma la grol 'khrul nges pa'i rtags): Fourfold framework—(1) sngon du lus kyis sku gsung thugs la ji ltar sbyangs pa'i rtags (previous body training in three-kaya signs); (2) ngag gis ji ltar goms pa'i rtags (speech familiarity signs); (3) sems kyis ji ltar bslabs pa'i rtags (mind training signs); (4) rtags kyi rim pa (sign sequence), 'byung ba'i 'thad pa (logical arising), goms na 'bras bu (familiarity results), ma goms na nges pa mi rnyed pa (no certainty without familiarity). Tantric instructional provisionality: signs as recognition-indicators, not guarantees. Risk: reifying signs as permanent endowments or absence as permanent deficiency.

Three-kaya body signs (sku'i rtags): Dpal nam mkha' med pa sku gdung 'bar ba chen po'i rgyud citation. Forehead (dpral ba'i dkyil): dung g.yas su 'khyil pa (right-swirling conch) or rtse gsum 'dra ba (trident-shaped) gnyer ma g.yen 'greng (vertical wrinkles) marked with OṂ—ri mo'am rang 'bur du yod pa (lines or protrusions).

Heart (snying ga): rdo rje (vajra), 'khor lo (wheel), rtse gsum gyi sha mdangs (trident radiance), rin po che'i dbyibs (jewel shape), HŪṂ marked. Tantric physiology: marks indicating subtle-body development. Risk: literalizing as physical deformities; seeking marks as status symbols.

Logical arising ('byung ba'i 'thad pa): 'Gro ba kun la gzhi nas sku gsung thugs rang la yod pa (three kayas inherently present in all beings).

De nyid las citation: shan pa smad 'tshong skal med la'ang (even butcher, outcaste, unfortunate), gzhi nas sku gsung thugs yod pas (have three kayas inherently).

'Di kun la yang 'byung ba yod (can appear in all). Definitive assertion: signs confirm recognition-capacity already present, not created by training. Risk: temporalizing into linear causation—"practice now, signs later."

Tantric framework: sequential development through practice. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology—taking timeframes literally rather than as intensity metaphors.

Risk: elitism—"gifted speakers" vs "ordinary" practitioners; or discouragement—"I have no eloquence, therefore no capacity."

Mind signs (sems kyi rtags): Natural concentration, clear dreams, compassion arising spontaneously. Previous vajra-mind training indicators: mi rtog pa'i gting yangs (depth of non-conceptuality), rmi lam gsal ba (clear dreams), snying rje rang byung (self-arisen compassion). Without familiarity: rtog pa mang ba (many thoughts), rmi lam mi gsal (unclear dreams), snying rje dka' ba (difficult compassion). Tantric view: mind qualities as training-results. Risk: reifying mind-signs as permanent traits; spiritual narcissism—"my clear dreams prove my advancement."

Dzogchen view of signs: All signs—body, speech, mind—rang snang (self-appearance) of rig pa. Not "I have signs therefore I am advanced" but "signs appear as display of awareness." Definitive meaning: signs neither exist nor non-exist as indicators. Recognition beyond signs: whether signs present or absent, awareness nature unchanged. Risk: nihilistic dismissal—"signs don't matter at all"; or elitist clinging—"my signs prove my realization."

Bardo application: Signs indicate grol 'khrul (liberation or delusion) in bar do (intermediate state). Previous training manifests as grol ba'i rtags (liberation signs) or 'khrul ba'i rtags (delusion signs). Clear recognition of signs supports bar do liberation. Tantric framework: using present signs to predict/configure future capacity. Risk: temporalizing into fatalistic determinism—"signs determine my future."

Beyond bardo: Signs as appearances in awareness—neither binding nor liberating in themselves. Recognition of signs' empty nature as actual liberation. Definitive meaning: no bardo, no liberation, no delusion—only awareness recognizing itself. Signs appear, signs dissolve: awareness remains.

Obstructions (bar chod): 'Phral gyi mi dge ba (immediate non-virtue), las kyi 'phren pa shugs drag (forceful karma momentum) can obstruct sign-manifestation. Purification necessary: bshags pa (confession), bsngo ba (dedication), sbyin pa (generosity). Tantric framework: obstacles as surmountable through practice, not permanent blockages.

Obstruction transcendence: Bar chod as rang snang (self-appearance) of awareness—not external obstacles but recognition-opportunities. Definitive meaning: no obstruction, no purification—awareness primordially pure. Risk: view-collapse if transcendence used to bypass necessary purification; or clinging to purification as inherently necessary.

Interface teaching: Tantric sign-recognition as upaya for those requiring indicators. Dzogchen recognition beyond signs as definitive meaning. Pedagogical dialectic: provisional sign-framework supporting definitive recognition. Some practitioners need signs as encouragement; others recognize directly without signs.

Final synthesis: Signs as signlessness (rtags rtags med). All three-kaya marks dissolve in single rig pa. Body marks—emptiness; speech eloquence—silence; mind clarity—non-conceptuality. Definitive meaning: complete liberation beyond sign-recognition. Final declaration: whether signs present or absent, recognition complete.
