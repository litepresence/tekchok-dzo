<classification> Three paths of liberation: (1) Complete perfection manifests as Buddha through vajra eye—seeing vast pure wisdom-appearances, slight familiarization with nature liberates definitely. (2) Bubble eye: four appearances must reach final consummation. Vajra-bubble eye: spontaneous presence as ground (Great Seal), four life-powers of humans, wisdom-dharmatā-discrimination. Bubble eye appearances: flickering, going, coming, parting, gathering, trembling—sun, moon, three lamp supports as methods. Four meaning-movements classification. Declarative assertion of progressive appearance recognitions. Risk of reifying eyes as literal organs rather than recognition-faculties.
