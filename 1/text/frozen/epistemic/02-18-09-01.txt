<classification> Seng Ge teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Citation from Seng Ge: self-display, phenomena in vessel-hook-continuum, abiding—establishes that awareness's phenomena abide within vessel-hook-continuum of recognition-display. Citation from Nor Bu Phra: suffering—this is sems-side provisional describing how delusion manifests as suffering, like carrying heavy burden. Statement: in that, Fully-Awakening's awareness in vessel-hook-continuum is thoroughly shining. Risk of reification: treating Seng Ge and Nor Bu Phra as mystical beings rather than authoritative citations.

<classification> Cessation-cognition teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Description of cessation-cognition, empty, clear, beyond-limit's understanding-capacity and wisdom-qualities—establishes that recognition is capacity to understand emptiness, clarity, beyond-limit without adding wisdom-qualities. Statement: from that, beginning and worn-out—indicates recognition is not through gradual practice but primordial beginning. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating cessation-cognition as meditative state to cultivate rather than recognition of what is already present.

<classification> Experience-qualities teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side for practitioners who benefit from structured path. Three qualities: (1) wisdom, pleasure, experience; (2) worn-out experience; (3) appearance, experience, three arising—these are descriptions of recognition's modes, not stages to achieve. Gnad: body-speech gnad—accumulated wind, mind's object, separated—indicates when wind is calmed and mind-object separation recognized, recognition rests naturally. Risk of reification: treating pleasure as attainment rather than recognition's natural display.

<classification> Experience method teaching operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. Instruction: in affliction and ground, great-quantity—describes that many recognitions should occur within context of affliction and ground. Two, three—refers to recognition of two aspects or three aspects with consistency. Three—indicates three recognitions are distinguished without characteristics. Risk of practice-misread-as_ontology: treating experience method as graduated technique rather than recognition-framework.

<classification> Self-nature teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Within that, expanse-clear—describes recognition's inner nature: clarity, emptiness, expanse. Statement: enjoying wisdom also grasping—if pleasure arises, wisdom's grasping is never established; recognition's gnad is already self-nature. Risk of view-collapse: interpreting self-nature as essential entity rather than recognition's self-knowing quality.

<classification> Awareness-in-expanse-between teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement: awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make—this is definitive instruction on how recognition rests. "Between" does not refer to spatial location but to recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. Instruction to "make not waver"—not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of view-collapse: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.

<classification> Wisdom's experience teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side for practitioners who benefit from structured analysis. Statement: wisdom's experience is mind, because—establishes that wisdom's experience is ordinary cognition, not separate awareness. Analysis: imagination, all—arising, spontaneously—indicates conceptual imagination arises spontaneously and gathers through conceptual reasoning. Risk of view-collapse: treating wisdom's experience as attainment rather than recognition of ordinary cognition.

<classification> Pleasure-deriving teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side. From practice, pleasure-arising—describes that pleasure arises from practice but is provisional. Worn-out analysis: when pleasure is worn-out, pursuit of external things is seen as meaningless. Statement: this is pleasure-deriving—also attaining self-power's pleasure, without artificiality, distinguishing by intellect after meditating—this is upāya for distinguishing recognition from artificial states. Risk of reification: treating pleasure as achievement rather than recognition's natural display.

<classification> Thought-poison teaching operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. Instruction: this, poison, inserted—exhausted, settled—like—indicates poison refers to conceptual thought that obscures recognition; antidote is to exhaust and settle it. Statement: thought time, without, seeing, self-prime, not-placed—establishes that recognition sees thought as primordial and never established. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating poison-inserting as formal technique rather than recognition's capacity to see through delusion.
