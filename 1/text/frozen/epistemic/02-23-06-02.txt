<classification> Mathematical enumeration of bardo appearances: twenty-four (nyi shu rtsa bzhi), four divisions of four (bzhi bzhi), remaining three with six each (drug drug), totaling one hundred thirty-four (brgya sum cu bzhi'i). Dzogchen-rigpa view organizing apparitional display into numerical framework without reifying categories as substantial. Risk of reifying numerical divisions as ontological entities rather than pedagogical scaffolding.

<classification> Twenty-one faculties (dbang po nyi shu rtsa gcig) classification: six with outflow (zag bcas) seen as thirty, thirty without outflow (zag med), final utterly without outflow (shin tu zag med). Technical classification of perception modes in bardo state. Pure/impure perception (dag ma dag) framework organizing bardo phenomenology.

<classification> Six abhijñas (mngon par shes pa drug) arising from bardo recognition. Citation from Nyida Kha Svarna Guhyatantra (nyi zla kha sbyor): previous life knowledge (sngon gyi skye gnas shes pa), death and transmigration ('chi 'pho), birth knowledge (skye ba shes pa), others' minds (pha rol gyi sems shes pa), hidden phenomena knowledge (snang ba lkog tu gyur pa thams cad shes pa), six realms' locations knowledge (rigs drug gi gnas mthong zhing shes pa), faculties' purification (dbang po rnam par dag pa'i mngon par shes pa). Tantric-transformative view using result-vehicle attainments as bardo support.

<classification> Dhāraṇī (gzungs) attainment: previously heard teachings simultaneously arising, innumerable new teachings appearing—this is dharmatā bardo (chos nyid kyi bar do). Dzogchen-rigpa view recognizing dhāraṇī as spontaneous wisdom-display rather than accumulated memory. Risk of reifying dhāraṇī as mental faculty rather than natural recognition-condition.

<classification> Samādhi exhaustion (ting nge 'dzin gyi zad lugs): mind's engagement exhausted in dharmatā purity, abiding non-conceptually. Where exhausted? In own continuum. How exhausted? Grasping at previous virtues' display dissolves into dharmatā purity. Appearance at that time—dharmatā exhaustion-appearance dawns, afflictive conceptions (rnam rtog ngan pa) of previous fixation, subsequent grasping, good clairvoyance (mngon shes), memory (rjes dran) utterly non-arising, like pure space. Citation: "Continuous samādhi nature dawns in continuum, therefore afflictive conceptions utterly non-arise." Twenty-one faculties' liberation and delusion modes known separately.

<classification> Spontaneous presence dissolution (lhun grub kyi thim tshul): eight dissolutions (thim lugs brgyad) occurring simultaneously. Eightfold dissolution framework:
1. Compassion into compassion (thugs rje thugs rje la thim pa)—like sun's rays gathering at sunset
2. Rig families' display not seen, impure delusion nameless, beyond visible appearance
3. Light into light ('od 'od la thim pa)—like rainbow dissolving into space, color-mark boundaries absent, merging into single flavor sphere beyond conceived emptiness
4. Kāya into kāya (sku sku la thim pa)—like vase kāya, knowables clear within, no established marks-form hands-face, completely pure
5. Wisdom into wisdom (ye shes ye shes la thim pa)—like child entering mother's lap, dharmatā mother-child non-dual mixing without recognition
6. Non-dual into non-dual (gnyis med gnyis med la thim pa)—like river into river, originally liberated, single flavor dharmakāya, equal sameness without distinction, free from elaborations
7. Extreme liberation into extreme liberation (mtha' grol mtha' grol la thim pa)—like space into space, no object to release into emptiness, beyond thought
8. Impure samsāra gate into pure wisdom gate (ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo dag pa ye shes kyi sgo la thim pa)—like mouse cutting rope, thigle unified, dha thim
9. Pure wisdom gate into essence ka-dag (dag pa ye shes kyi sgo ngo bo ka dag la thim pa)—like lion entering snow, no dread or fear, awareness arrived at own object

Spoken from recognition-register: "Know these eight dissolutions when seeing truth-power of spontaneous presence self-nature." Risk of view-collapse if sequential reading imposed on simultaneous display.

<classification> Eight similes for dissolution recapitulated: sunset rays, mother-child, rainbow, vase, rivers, space, lion-snow, mouse-rope. Instructional provisionality using familiar metaphors to point to non-conceptual recognition.

<classification> Essential instructions for liberation (gnad kyi man ngag): two aspects—hitting the essential point through dharmatā meaning (chos nyid don gyi man ngag), focusing through three time essential points (dus gsum gnad kyi man ngag). First: demonstrating means of hitting essential point in this life and bardo both. Three essential points of essence, nature, compassion (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum): essence-essential point—self-recognition immediately (rang thog tu ngo shes), nature-essential point—decision immediately (yin thog tu thag chod), compassion-essential point—confidence immediately (grol thog tu gdengs bc'a' ba). Dzogchen triad of immediate recognition without gradual progression.
