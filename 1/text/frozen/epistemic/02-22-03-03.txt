<classification> Thögal classified: spontaneous vision aspect of Dzogchen complementing Trekchö's cutting through. Trekchö emphasizes empty essence through freedom from elaborations; Thögal emphasizes luminous nature through spontaneous vision. Direct crossing: bypassing gradual stages to directly manifest three kayas. Definitive meaning: light, bindus, awareness described are not products of practice but self-display of awareness's own nature. Longchenpa integrates primordial purity and spontaneous presence: Thögal is spontaneous presence aspect made visible. Direct crossing visions are not hallucinations or imaginative constructs but natural manifestation of awareness's clarity aspect. When awareness recognizes itself, its self-radiance becomes visible as light, bindus, pure forms. Not perception of external objects but awareness seeing its own nature. Practitioner does not create these visions—they spontaneously arise when conditions are present. Thögal is natural complement to Trekchö: where Trekchö cuts through to emptiness, Thögal manifests luminous display of that emptiness. Both necessary for complete recognition. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as experiences to have rather than recognition of what is.
