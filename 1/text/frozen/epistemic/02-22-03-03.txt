<classification> Thögal classified: spontaneous vision aspect of Dzogchen complementing Trekchö's cutting through. Trekchö emphasizes empty essence through freedom from elaborations; Thögal emphasizes luminous nature through spontaneous vision. Direct crossing: bypassing gradual stages to directly manifest three kayas. Definitive meaning: light, bindus, awareness described are not products of practice but self-display of awareness's own nature. Longchenpa integrates primordial purity and spontaneous presence: Thögal is spontaneous presence aspect made visible. Direct crossing visions are not hallucinations or imaginative constructs but natural manifestation of awareness's clarity aspect. When awareness recognizes itself, its self-radiance becomes visible as light, bindus, pure forms. Not perception of external objects but awareness seeing its own nature. Practitioner does not create these visions—they spontaneously arise when conditions are present. Thögal is natural complement to Trekchö: where Trekchö cuts through to emptiness, Thögal manifests luminous display of that emptiness. Both necessary for complete recognition. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as experiences to have rather than recognition of what is.

<classification> Passage introduces four lamps—foundational framework for Thögal practice: lamp of channel where body abides, lamp of path of nature, lamp of fruition of consummation, and implicit fourth lamp of awareness. These are definitive meaning: not techniques to create visions but recognition-structures for what already manifests. Risk of reification: treating lights, bindus, visions as real entities to be perceived, or believing seeing these indicates spiritual attainment. Bindus central to Thögal: not energetic essence of completion stage but luminous sphere of awareness's self-display. Threefold division—body-abiding bindu, path bindu, fruition bindu—structures recognition-process while transcending it: all three are ever-present aspects of single awareness. Presentation prevents sequential reading: four lamps are simultaneous, not stages to progress through. First lamp is not prerequisite for accessing others—all four aspects of awareness's display are already manifest. Lamps are pedagogical categories for indivisible display of awareness. Practice is recognition, not production.
