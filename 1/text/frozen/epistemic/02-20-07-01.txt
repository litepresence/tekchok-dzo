<classification> Inner tantras (Mahayoga, Anuyoga) classified as highest provisional register—bridge methodology to Atiyoga. Register elevation: outer→inner marks shift from constructed to instantaneous. Dualism retained in method; non-duality asserted in view. Completion stage operates through energetic transformation rather than conceptual purification. Unlike generation stage's deliberate visualization, completion works with subtle body—channels, winds, bindus—already present. Practitioner does not create deity but recognizes energetic basis of enlightenment within their own body. Closer to Dzogchen's recognitive approach yet still method-dependent. Longchenpa maps inner tantras as bridge: tantric vocabulary maintained while preparing for Atiyoga's method-free recognition. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating subtle body as ultimate reality, or equating energetic accomplishment with spiritual realization. Completion stage produces genuine siddhi, yet within Dzogchen hermeneutics these remain provisional.
