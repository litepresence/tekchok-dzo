<classification> Five wisdoms mandala (rig pa'i ye shes lnga) visualization with teacher and student entering rDul tshon gyi dkyil 'khor (colored powder mandala). Four empowerments: vase (bum pa), secret (gsang ba), wisdom-knowledge (shes rab ye shes), and word empowerment (tshig dbang). Fourth empowerment as rDzogs pa chen po (great perfection) through four signs (brda bzhi). Celebration (dga' ston) marking completion. Tantric transformative framework establishing gradual empowerment sequence.

<classification> Lineage transmission from Vimala (bi ma la) to gTsang ston (lce btsun) as actual empowerment sequence (dngos su bs kur ba'i rim pa). Contemporary practice (deng sang) maintaining ritual continuity (phyag len). Disputed lineages: two from Gu ru Jo 'ber (gnyis gur jo 'ber) as broken (chad pa). Earlier transmissions (gong nas) as mere signs (brda tsam), without ritual continuity. Treasure (gter) revelations difficult to authenticate (phyag 'debs dka' ba), thus not established. However, meaning elaboration (don spros) sufficient, and practical application (lag len) has root empowerment (dbang gi rtsa ba), so not difficult. Lama's instruction: transmitted empowerment without contradiction whether authenticated or not. Risk of reifying lineage as institutional authority rather than recognition-transmission.

<classification> Seventeen aspects (bco bdun) of wisdom-knowledge empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang) establishing profound meaning (nang don): (1) examining and seeking consort (rig ma brtag cing btsal ba); (2) how to draw her in (dgu pa); (3) examining channel characteristics (rtsa'i mtshan nyid brtag pa); (4) expanding bodhicitta (byang chub kyi sems rgyas par bya ba); (5) training in dharani (gzungs ma la bslab pa) establishing mantra path (sngags kyi lam); (6) pith instructions for generating bliss (bde ba bskyed pa'i thabs kyi man ngag); (7) special seat (sbyor ba khyad par can gyi gdan) for seeking and holding channels (rtsa btsal zhing gzung ba); (8) placing conventional bindu (kun rdzob kyi thig le) relying on body vital points (lus kyi gnad); (9) body postures (lus kyi 'dug stangs); (10) holding through wind vital points (rlung gi gnad kyis gzung ba); (11) how to train bindu (thig le ji ltar sbyang ba); (12) applying to mahamudra of great bliss (bde chen gyi phyag rgya); (13) definite bliss generation sequence (bde ba skye ba'i go rims); (14) connecting with view (lta ba dang sbyar zhing 'gyur ba rtsi ba); (15) placing bindu at channel focal point (thig le rtsa'i dmigs su dgram zhing rlung dang bsres pas lus kyi stobs rgyas par bya zhing don dam pa byang chub kyi sems la sbyar ba); (16) reversing three times for student's benefit (slob ma'i don la lan gsum bzlog nas slar phab ste dbang bskur ba khyad par can gyi nges shes dang sbyar ba); (17) student generating mahamudra experience free from object (bde chen gzung yul du bral ba'i nyams skyes pa'i tshad gzung ba). Continuous practice (rgyun du bsten) making invisible (mi mthong bar bya), not practicing outside empowerment time (dbang gi dus las gzh du mi bsten), offering fee (yon phul) then freely releasing (rang gi gnas su ci bder gtang ba).

<classification> Consort examination through four aspects: caste (rigs), form (dbyibs), color (kha dog), behavior (spyod lam). Caste examination: external caste—royal caste (rgyal rigs) achieving Buddha of Buddha-family (bde bar gshegs pa'i rigs kyi sangs rgyas), ministerial caste (rje'u rigs) achieving Vajra, merchant caste (dmangs rigs) achieving Jewel, brahmin caste achieving Lotus, outcaste caste (gdol pa'i rigs) achieving Karma-family Buddha. Misconception clarification: not that any single Buddha is achieved, but each caste requires corresponding consort—without appropriate consort for each caste, accomplishment impossible. Five Buddha families correspond to five castes. dBang bskod chen po citation establishing correspondence. Risk of reifying caste as essential nature rather than symbolic classification.
