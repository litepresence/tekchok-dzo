<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>reification
<classification> Foundational Dzogchen view: ground as primordially pure and spontaneously present. Terminology—wisdom expanse, dharmata, self-arisen svabhvikakaya—marks definitive meaning par excellence. Unlike sutric or tantric registers, this operates from direct view of awareness without reliance on reasoning or transformation. Epistemic status: declarative finality—not instructions to follow but descriptions of ever-present reality. Longchenpa asserts ground as basis for all vehicles—the same nature underlying all vehicles. Fivefold analytical framework—essence, terminology, divisions, characteristics, fruition—structures presentation while transcending it. These are pedagogical categories for the category-free ground. Essence of expanse: vast, pervading greatness, self-nature of clear self-clarity. Not definition but pointing to what cannot be defined. Terminology maps center, expanse, dharmata as synonymous pointers to same non-dual ground. Risk of reification: treating ground as metaphysical foundation.
