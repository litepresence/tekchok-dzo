<classification> This passage presents Trekchö—definitive Dzogchen practice of directly cutting through all grasping and solidity of mind. Unlike tantric completion stage working with subtle body energetics, Trekchö operates directly on level of awareness—recognizing all thoughts, emotions, appearances are self-liberated upon arising. Terminology—freedom from elaborations, unfabricated, self-settled—represents definitive meaning: no practice in conventional sense, only recognition of what already is. Longchenpa distinguishes Trekchö from all lower methods: no visualization, no mantra, no meditation object—only direct recognition of awareness's own nature. Khregs refers to reification of experience—the belief in substantial existence of self, phenomena, and mind. Trekchö cuts through by direct recognition that all appearances are self-liberated—they leave no trace in awareness. Not analysis of thoughts or transformation of them, but recognition of their empty nature from the beginning. Hallmark of Trekchö is freedom from all philosophical positions—no view to maintain, no meditation to perform, only naked awareness. Longchenpa presents this as direct path: cutting through all reference points to reference-free nature of awareness itself. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating this as practice to do rather than recognition of what is.

<classification> Passage establishes relationship between Trekchö and Thögal—two aspects of Dzogchen practice. Trekchö emphasizes primordial purity: cutting through constructs to recognize empty essence. Thögal emphasizes spontaneous presence: direct crossing to luminous nature through spontaneous vision. Epistemically, they are non-dual: cannot have one without other. Risk of view-collapse: treating Trekchö and Thögal as separate practices to perform, or believing one superior. Longchenpa presents them as two aspects of single awareness—Trekchö is emptiness aspect, Thögal is appearance aspect. The dyad mirrors primordial purity and spontaneous presence structure: two aspects of single awareness. Trekchö cuts through to empty essence; Thögal manifests luminous nature. They are not sequential—cannot have one without other—but simultaneous recognition of awareness's two aspects. Presentation prevents error of choosing one over the other: both necessary, both already complete. Definitive view: no practice of Trekchö or Thögal—only recognition that awareness is already self-liberated and already spontaneously manifesting.
