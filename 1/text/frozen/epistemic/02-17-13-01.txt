<classification> Outer phenomena view (phyi chos can lta ba): viewing phenomena as without self-nature through vajra-eye, seeing appearance as eight illusion-similes. Delusion not truly established—no doubt of returning to three realms, mind at ease. Viewing particulars with prajñā-eye: conventional appearance realized as groundless great primordial purity, rigpa without action or latency imprints. Sun-Moon Union citation: objects appearing as referents familiarized as without self-nature, appearance-emptiness nondual, six collections unobstructed. Rigpa Rangshar citation: phenomena appearing as characteristics with unceasing eye-sense power—excellent mind view, self-rigpa clear, outer appearance miracle, concept-free clarity essence, known as great self-arisen. Instructional provisionality of graduated recognition through outer phenomena. Risk of view-collapse: seeing "outer" as separate from inner/secret rather than aspect of single recognition.

<classification> Inner dharmatā view (nang chos nyid lta ba): viewing absence of self-nature with wisdom-eye, realizing no grasping mind even in self-awareness, mind at ease in exhausted dharmas nature. Rigpa Rangshar citation: dharmatā rigpa without arising, concepts-characteristics naturally absent, rigpa without negation-affirmation—where is clinging conduct? Dharmatā thinking known as nature without doing. Rigpa free from action-actor, not falling in any direction—called great meditation. Realization: single-concept prajñā, mind depth-confident, dharmatā without arising realized. Declarative assertion that inner view transcends outer conceptual recognition. Risk of reifying "inner" as superior location rather than recognition-direction.
