<classification> Dharmas exhausted intellect-transcended meaning zinc-tin reliance wisdom change-change not recognition. Effortless vast great expanse all primordially transcended, bondage liberation abandon-accept not-existing manner samsara nirvana nameless great roll. Three: nature Dzogchen byar not sky-like meaning, bondage liberation non-dual own-mind emptiness root-free great thig-decided, object-vision mind's mirror collection six great pervade. First: outer vision inner awareness grasping-holding vision signs samsara nirvana gathered dharmas all—primordial emptiness universal emptiness great. Appearance-emptiness, intellect-emptiness, pure-emptiness, liberation-emptiness great. The three great emptinesses are not void but freedom from extremes. Risk of nihilism: emptiness as void interpretation rather than emptiness as luminous clarity.

<classification> Object-thought transcended liberation arisen. Direction-limitless nameless arisen roll. Not-look look not, look-doer not, looked not see. Not-meditate meditated not, meditate transcended, meditated also not liberate. Not-analyze analyzed not, analyzed not see. Spontaneous self-liberation is view. Effort-free self-established meditation. No-activity conduct. Result not-hope. The transcendence of meditation is not rejection but recognition of natural completion. Risk of nihilism: anti-meditation nihilism rejecting all practice rather than recognizing practice and non-practice as non-dual.

<classification> Self and holding's attachment object, first itself dharmadhatu, this all self self-appearance. From Jewel Garland. The self-appearance is not solipsistic projection but the ground's natural display. Risk of reification: interpreting self-appearance as individual mind's creation rather than non-dual play of awareness.

<classification> Vision delusion's nature this, wisdom is previously not seen. Concept-with delusion's basis not-existing, alaya dharmakaya great realized. Delusion's self-concept continuity ceased. Thus delusion-free vision, primordially fallen main-point from arising. Beings' aggregates buddha body, primordially is who not awareness. Aggregates buddha possession-lord, channels abiding letters completely arise. Vision delusion is wisdom when recognized. Risk of view-collapse: mistaking this as permission to remain deluded rather than urgent call to recognize.

<classification> Bubbles in eyes—wisdom self-appearance who not seen. From Jewel Garland: This also quality gem, Again quality this-like. Two-non-existent self-dissolving, river space analogies. Water drops indistinguishable yet flowing, space no separation. Two-non-existent both extremes dissolved, single-one free from elaboration. All bodies speeches continuums exhaust into nirvana by self-dissolving. Extreme self pure—like space dissolving into space. The analogies point to non-dual recognition, not phenomenal illusion. Risk of nihilism: treating appearances as merely illusory rather than wisdom-display.

Aggregates exhaustion buddha confidence complete, aggregates channels exhaustion completely confidence. Aggregates elements exhaustion confidence. From Self-Arisen: Buddha confidence view dharmakaya, meditation sambhogakaya, conduct emanation, result three kayas essence—not established nature clear light. The exhaustion of aggregates is not destruction but recognition of purity. Risk of nihilism: reading exhaustion as annihilation rather than transcendence of fixation.

<classification> View dharmakaya meditation sambhogakaya, conduct emanation result three kayas essence—not established nature clear light. Four great confidences: view confidence, meditation confidence, conduct confidence, result confidence. Spontaneous liberation beyond meditation. The four are aspects of one recognition, not separate compartments. Risk of view-collapse: treating view, meditation, conduct, result as sequential stages rather than simultaneous expressions.

<classification> Dharmakaya's view spontaneously self-liberated. Sambhogakaya's meditation spontaneously self-liberated. Emanation's conduct spontaneously self-liberated. Three kayas' result spontaneously self-accomplished. Spontaneously presence's meaning definite. From Self-Arisen: Primordially pure spontaneous presence. From Jewel Garland: Great bliss dharmadhatu wheel, wisdom ornament great. The spontaneous liberation is recognition, not passivity. Risk of nihilism: interpreting spontaneous as excuse for non-effort rather than natural perfection.
