<classification> Inner tantras (Mahayoga, Anuyoga) classified as highest provisional register—bridge methodology to Atiyoga. Register elevation: outer→inner marks shift from constructed to instantaneous. Dualism retained in method; non-duality asserted in view. Completion stage operates through energetic transformation rather than conceptual purification. Unlike generation stage's deliberate visualization, completion works with subtle body—channels, winds, bindus—already present. Practitioner does not create deity but recognizes energetic basis of enlightenment within their own body. Closer to Dzogchen's recognitive approach yet still method-dependent. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating subtle body as ultimate reality, or equating energetic accomplishment with spiritual realization. Completion stage produces genuine siddhi, yet within Dzogchen hermeneutics these remain provisional.

<classification> Integration of inner tantra with Dzogchen terminology marks Longchenpa's hermeneutical strategy. Terms like spontaneously accomplished samadhi, three kayas, dharmakaya bridge tantric completion stage with Dzogchen recognition. However, epistemic status remains instructional provisionality: subtle body experiences described are still transformative rather than recognitive. Risk of view-collapse: treating visionary experiences, lights, bindus as real accomplishments rather than awareness-display. Experiences of completion stage are genuine transformations of perception but remain within realm of experience. They are signs that practice is proceeding correctly but can become obstacles if grasped. Longchenpa's presentation elevates these toward Dzogchen by interpreting them as self-display of awareness rather than achievements. This prepares practitioner for Atiyoga: experiences recognized as ground's spontaneous presence.

<classification> Passage culminates in Dzogchen terminology transcending tantric methodology: primordially liberated, self-liberated, unfabricated. These represent definitive meaning of inner tantra—recognition that all completion stage practices were never necessary because ground is already perfect. However, within full nine-vehicle hierarchy this remains provisional preparation for Atiyoga. Same nature principle: inner tantra and Dzogchen share same view but differ in method and capacity. Longchenpa's presentation honors necessity of completion stage while indicating its ultimate provisional status. Definitive assertion that ground is already perfect does not negate value of completion stage practice. From perspective of ground, nothing was ever impure; from perspective of path, purification appears necessary. Holding both simultaneously: honoring provisional necessity of method while asserting definitive freedom from method. Practitioner who has stabilized completion stage recognition is ripe for Atiyoga. Dzogchen view is not rejection of tantra but recognition of what tantra was always pointing toward: self-liberated nature of all experience. Path and fruition are non-dual even while path remains necessary.

<classification> Inner tantras classified within tantric framework as highest provisional register. Epistemic elevation: outer→inner shifts from constructed to instantaneous method. Completion stage transforms energetic basis through subtle body practices. Within Dzogchen hermeneutics this remains provisional—direct preparation for Atiyoga. Transformative register: energetic transformation rather than conceptual purification.
