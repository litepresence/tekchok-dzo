<risk>reification: temporal metrics mistaken for ontological claims
<classification> Exponential time dilation in hell realms with geometric progression calculations. Reviving hell through Avici with escalating human-to-divine time ratios. Mathematics encoding psychological intensity—deeper hells as longer subjective time. Sutric provisional cosmology presenting recognition-context. Risk of literalizing as physical geography rather than mind's display.

<risk>reification: phenomenological description read as metaphysical assertion
<classification> Eight cold hells named by symptoms with lifespan calculations. Kosala's sesame measurement producing astronomical numbers encoding infinite from finite perspective. Preta and animal realm lifespans. Indefiniteness of animal realm reflecting ignorance's amorphous nature. Sutric framework for understanding karmic consequence. Risk of temporal literalism.

<risk>reification: experiential intensity literalized as duration
<classification> Risk clarification on elaborate time calculations. Actual meaning encodes psychological intensity and karmic weight—experience of duration rather than clock time. All hells as chos can with empty nature allowing liberation. Dzogchen view: realms as rang snang of ma rig pa, no external hell exists. Detailed cosmology as tha snyad upaya, not don dam truth. Clearing misconception of permanent condemnation.
