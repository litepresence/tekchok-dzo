Characteristics vehicle conduct (mtshan nyid kyi theg pa'i spyod pa): Common path entry (lam thun mong du zhugs) but not quick liberation conduct (myur du grol ba'i spyod pa ma yin). Rang shar citation: non-attachment-holding conduct bound by great clinging to meaning (don gyis chags pa chen pos bCings) without method (thabs med). Sutric-provisional register: conceptual non-attachment as negational clearing, not final recognition. Risk: collapsing intellectual non-attachment into recognition of primordial freedom; mistaking philosophical restraint for spontaneous freedom.

Secret mantra general conduct (gsang sngags spyi'i spyod pa): Method exists (thabs yod) but effort-accomplishment remains (rtsol sgrub la gnas). Rang shar citation: dgag sgrub med pa'i spyod pa (conduct without negation-affirmation) - outer-inner secret mantra not desiring to stop afflictions (nyon mongs 'gags par mi 'dod) or accomplish wisdom (ye shes bsgrub par mi 'dod). Superior (khyad par 'phags) through method existence but not true conduct (yang dag spyod pa min). Tantric-transformative register demonstrating refined doing-framework. Risk: practicing method as liberation rather than recognition-display; reifying "transformative conduct" as ontologically superior.

Declarative finality: conduct as recognition-expression, not practice. Risk: reifying "primordial conduct" as special state; temporalizing timeless freedom.

Twenty-one conducts (spyod pa nyi shu rtsa gcig) from Nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud (Sun-Moon Union Sutra): Bee-like (bung ba lta bu) - tasting all dharma flavors (chos kun gyi ni ro myang); deer-like (ri dwags lta bu) - abandoning confusion-condition objects; dumb-person-like (lkugs pa lta bu) - abandoning confusion speech; peacock-like (thi bya lta bu) - cutting secret mantra doubts; madman-like (smyon pa lta bu) - abandoning single-abiding objects; lion-like (seng ge lta bu) - abandoning fear mind, moving in charnel grounds; dog-pig-like (khyi phag lta bu) - abandoning pure-impure discrimination; cloud-like (ldom bu lta bu) - using memory-thought as it comes; child-like (bu chung lta bu) - abandoning long confusion attachment; fish-like (rnga mo lta bu) - attracting with worldly-appropriate words; elephant-like (glang chen lta bu) - reversing samsara battles from depth. Provisionality: animal metaphors as recognition-vehicles. Risk: literalizing conducts as behaviors to perform; missing metaphorical pointing to recognition.

Continued twenty-one conducts: deer-like (again) - abandoning child-enemy perceptions; she-monkey-like (rgYa mo lta bu) - contentment cutting desire-time; bear-like (dred mo lta bu) - not spreading samsara seeds; brahmin-like (bram ze lta bu) - abandoning others' enjoyments-food; heroine-like (dpa' mo lta bu) - dividing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa battle lines; water-letter-like (chu yig lta bu) - placing memory-support in own place; sky-dagger-wheel-like (nam mkha'i mdung skor) - zang thal conduct toward objects; intermediate-space-wind-like (bar snang rlung 'dra) - abandoning grasping-holding thoughts; garuda-like (bya khyung lta bu) - cutting abysses with waves; mountain-like (ri bo lta bu) - changeless self-pure above conduct. Tantric-transformative register: metaphorical conduct descriptions as transformative upaya. Risk: collapsing metaphorical conduct into literal behavior; missing recognition-pointing.

Dzogchen conduct distinction: All twenty-one conducts resolve into single ye grol spyod pa (primordially liberated conduct). Not "doing any of these" but "recognizing all conduct displays primordial freedom." Polemical distinction between tantric "conduct as method" and Dzogchen "conduct as display." Animal metaphors dissolve into single recognition: bee's tasting = awareness savoring experience; deer's solitude = non-dwelling; lion's fearlessness = recognition without obstruction. Risk: collapsing Dzogchen into "no conduct needed"; or proliferating Dzogchen as "special conduct."

Vajra song-dance conduct (rdo rje'i glu gar bya ba'i rim pa): Sequential progression of conduct through song (glu) and dance (gar) as tantric transformative method. Tantra citations on conduct completion through vajra-expression. Physical conduct (lus kyi spyod pa), verbal conduct (ngag gi spyod pa), mental conduct (sems kyi spyod pa) coordinated. Risk: reifying song-dance as required ritual; converting expressive display into obligatory performance.

Definitive conduct meaning: glu as gdangs (radiance) of awareness, gar as rol pa (play) of recognition. Not performance but natural expression. Sequential instructions dissolve into simultaneous recognition. Any conduct - beelike, lion-like, or "ordinary" - when recognized as display of primordial freedom, is Dzogchen conduct. Declarative finality: conduct and non-conduct indistinguishable in recognition. Risk: nihilistic interpretation as "no conduct needed at all"; missing that recognition naturally expresses as responsiveness.

Interface teaching: twenty-one conducts as upaya for practitioners requiring graduated engagement. Simultaneously, all conduct resolves into single recognition. Pedagogical dialectic: providing detailed framework while pointing beyond framework. Some practitioners benefit from bee-like conduct metaphor; others need lion-like; ultimately all metaphors dissolve in recognition. Risk: clinging to framework as necessary; or rejecting framework without recognition.

Primordial conduct nature: spyod pa (conduct) as spyod yul (object of conduct) dissolving into chos nyid (dharmatā). All objects of conduct - pure, impure, samsara, nirvana - equally display of awareness. Conduct without object, object without conduct. Single recognition encompassing all twenty-one metaphors. Final declaration: conduct as conductlessness (spyod pa med spyod), object as objectlessness.

Conduct finality: "Bee-like conduct" not conduct-to-perform but recognition-that-savors-all. "Lion-like conduct" not fearlessness-to-achieve but recognition-without-obstruction. Temporal language of "doing conduct" pedagogical provisionality. Definitive meaning: recognition already complete, conduct already perfect. No gradation from bee to lion to "finished" - all simultaneous aspects. Risk: temporalizing into conduct-progression; seeking "advanced" conduct.

Practical conduct application: Sequential instructions for those requiring structured practice. When to apply bee-like conduct, when lion-like, etc. Tantric transformative register providing operational guidelines. Sun-Moon Union Sutra as scriptural authority. Risk: converting recognition-display into conduct-rulebook; "I should be more deer-like" as spiritual ambition.

Ultimate conduct view: All instructions dissolve in single recognition. Conduct instructions like finger pointing to moon - necessary for those who cannot see moon directly, but finger not moon itself. For recognition-capacity, all twenty-one conducts spontaneously present without effort. Definitive meaning: no conduct, no non-conduct, no recognition, no non-recognition. Risk: nihilistic interpretation as "instructions useless"; missing pedagogical necessity.

Conduct perfection: spyod pa'i rgyan (conduct ornament) as ye shes rgyan (wisdom ornament). All conduct beautifies recognition, not recognition beautifies conduct. Twenty-one conducts as twenty-one facets of single awareness-display. Final classification: conduct complete, recognition complete, display complete.

Beyond conduct categories: Any attempt to "do" bee-like or lion-like conduct misses recognition. Any refusal to "do" conduct also misses recognition. Conduct neither exists nor non-exists as category - simultaneously both and neither. Primordially free from conduct-framework. Final declaration: Dzogchen conduct is recognition without conduct-concept.

Section conclusion: Three vehicles' conduct (mtshan nyid, gsang sngags, rdzogs chen) as three registers, not three levels. All dissolve in single recognition. Twenty-one conducts as skillful means for those requiring diversity, unified in single awareness. Definitive meaning: whatever conduct manifests, recognize as display of primordial freedom. Conduct section complete, recognition spontaneously present.
