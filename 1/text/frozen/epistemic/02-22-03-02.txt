<classification> Trekchö classified: definitive Dzogchen register cutting through grasping and solidity of mind. Unlike tantric completion stage's subtle body energetics, Trekchö operates directly on awareness—recognizing thoughts, emotions, appearances as self-liberated upon arising. Terminology—freedom from elaborations, unfabricated, self-settled—marks definitive meaning: no practice in conventional sense, only recognition of what already is. Longchenpa distinguishes Trekchö from lower methods: no visualization, no mantra, no meditation object—only direct recognition of awareness's own nature. Khregs: reification of experience, belief in substantial existence. Trekchö cuts through by direct recognition that all appearances are self-liberated—they leave no trace. Not analysis or transformation but recognition of empty nature from the beginning. Hallmark: freedom from all philosophical positions—no view to maintain, no meditation to perform, only naked awareness. Direct path: cutting through all reference points to reference-free nature. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating as practice to perform rather than recognition of what is.

<classification> Passage establishes relationship between Trekchö and Thögal—two aspects of Dzogchen practice. Trekchö emphasizes primordial purity: cutting through to recognize empty essence. Thögal emphasizes spontaneous presence: direct crossing to luminous nature. They are non-dual: cannot have one without other. Risk of view-collapse: treating them as separate practices or believing one superior. They are two aspects of single awareness—Trekchö emptiness aspect, Thögal appearance aspect. The dyad mirrors primordial purity and spontaneous presence: two aspects of single awareness. They are not sequential but simultaneous. Both necessary, both already complete. Definitive view: no practice—only recognition that awareness is already self-liberated and already spontaneously manifesting.
