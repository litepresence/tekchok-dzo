First aspect of Dharmakaya distinctions: from dharmata perspective, essence not established anywhere (chos nyid la ltos nas gang gi ngo bor yang ma grub pas), free from proliferation extremes (spros pa'i mtha' dang bral ba), beyond entity-apprehension (dngos po ngos gzung las 'das pas), without birth-death-change-transfer (skye 'jig 'pho 'gyur med pa), direct manifestation of final limit (mthar thug mngon du gyur pas), dharmata inconceivable (chos nyid bsam gyis mi khyab pa'o). Risk: reifying Dharmakaya as substantive void or empty space rather than inconceivable nature.

Second aspect: all-pervading Dharmakaya of samsara-nirvana (khor 'das kun la khyab pa'i chos sku), two-pure through adventitious stains being pure (dri ma glo bur bas dag pa'i dag pa gnyis ldan de yin te). Citation from Hevajra on sentient beings as Buddhas obscured by adventitious stains. Citation from Rgyud bla ma on Buddha-nature in all sentient beings. Third aspect: Dharmakaya's fields, abiding, samadhi, retinues, explanation, time from respective vehicle perspectives. Dharmakaya's Sambhogakaya field: dust-free, abiding of remembrance/concept self-exhausted, samadhi with ceased mind-mental factors, ye shes self-abiding, retinues as empty self-appearing function-possessors. Dharmakaya's Emanation body: field as emptiness unbroken, abiding as all's ground-appearance aspect gting gsal self-resonance great, samadhi unceasing self-clear, retinue classless pure-appearance, explanation nature unfabricated, time essence manifest appearance. Citation from Rin po che spungs pa. Risk: nihilistic reading of "empty" as non-existence rather than empty-clear inseparable.

Second: emanating as Sixth Victor etc. for whoever needs taming (gang la gang 'dul du sprul pa thub pa drug pa la sogs pa'o).

These benefit through pure Buddha appearance of five families. Citation on emanation body magical power taming. Emanation body is Dharmakaya nature pure field teacher five families (sprul pa sku'i chos sku rang bzhin dag pa'i zhing gi ston pa rigs lnga dang), here in Jambudvipa glorious great Vajradhara (mi mjed 'dir dpal rdo rje 'chang chen po), marks of four births body arisen (mtshan nyid skye ba bzhi'i lus su byung zhing), activity thirty-six completed accepted (mdzad pa sum cu rtsa drug mthar phyin par zhal gyis bzhes pa).

Abode possessing thousand lotus flowers (gnas me tog padma stong dang ldan pa), retinue beings included in four births ('khor skye ba bzhis bsdus pa'i 'gro ba). Risk: ranking fields hierarchically or literalizing emanation bodies as separate entities.
