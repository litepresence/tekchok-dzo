<classification> Madhyamaka critique of Cittamatra's self-awareness—even self-aware, self-luminous primordial wisdom naturally empty of essence. If consciousness existed inherently, could not be self-aware; if did not exist, nothing to be aware. Middle way transcending both existence and non-existence. Polemical distinction establishing emptiness of all positions.

<classification> Svatantrika subschool holding illusion as ultimate—appearance-aspect of illusion possessing some form of ultimate existence. Subtle eternalism grasping at clarity aspect as truly existent. Versus Prasangika non-abiding position transcending all extremes. Dzogchen view recognizing even luminous aspect as empty, beyond all four extremes.
