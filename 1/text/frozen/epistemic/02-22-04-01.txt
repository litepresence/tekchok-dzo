<classification> Thögal classified: spontaneous vision aspect of Dzogchen complementing Trekchö. Trekchö emphasizes empty essence through freedom from elaborations; Thögal emphasizes luminous nature through spontaneous vision. Direct crossing: bypassing gradual stages to directly manifest three kayas. Definitive meaning: light, bindus, awareness are not products of practice but self-display of awareness's own nature. Integration of primordial purity and spontaneous presence: Thögal is spontaneous presence made visible. Direct crossing visions are not hallucinations but natural manifestation of awareness's clarity aspect. When awareness recognizes itself, self-radiance becomes visible as light, bindus, pure forms. Not perception of external objects but awareness seeing its own nature. Practitioner does not create these visions—they spontaneously arise when conditions are present. Thögal is natural complement to Trekchö: where Trekchö cuts through to emptiness, Thögal manifests luminous display. Both necessary for complete recognition. Risk of view-collapse: treating as experiences to have rather than recognition.

<risk>reification
<classification> Four lamps framework for Thögal practice: lamp of channel where body abides, lamp of path of nature, lamp of fruition, implicit fourth lamp of awareness. These are definitive meaning: not techniques to create visions but recognition-structures for what already manifests. Risk of reification: treating lights, bindus as real entities, or believing seeing these indicates attainment. Bindus central: not energetic essence but luminous sphere of awareness's self-display. Threefold division structures recognition while transcending: all three are ever-present aspects. Presentation prevents sequential reading: four lamps are simultaneous, not stages. First lamp not prerequisite—all four aspects already manifest. Lamps are pedagogical categories for indivisible display. Practice is recognition, not production.
