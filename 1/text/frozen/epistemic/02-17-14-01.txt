<classification> Three royal metaphors for fruition. First: like royal caste receiving head empowerment, taking royal throne without change—rigpa taking its own place, dharmatā unchanging. Second: like king sending army to frontier then returning, royal retinue changes place—five gates consciousness dawn, ground empty, saṃsāra nameless. Third: like king's excellent minister captured by another king, that king must listen—moving mind consciousness continuum ceases, dawn-ground rigpa obtains self-power. Fruition not-returning like sandalwood fruit—not arisen from effort, meaning dwells primordially thus. Declarative assertion that fruition is recognition-throne, not achievement. Risk of reifying fruition as future acquisition rather than present throne.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> All-placement instruction (cog gzhag man ngag): all rigpa nature primordially self-arises, self-dwells, self-liberates—definitely decided. Whatever dawns, that itself at dawn-place without fabrication or change, spaciously placed. Six Vastnesses citation: mind-itself obtains existence, hope-fear self-pure, free from effort-accomplishment, three bodies self-complete. Wandering mind-itself, vehicles self-arisen, desire-king intellectual non-grasping, heart great secret complete. Mind-itself directed object, appearances various self-arisen, name-color individual, form as two aspects complete. Limitless mind-itself, appearance objects truly dawn, object-substance self-arisen, directed thing complete. Declarative assertion of self-complete primordial nature.

<risk>nihilism
<classification> Three gates primordially pure, three grasp-thought action imprints all self-purify as great purity—saṃsāra-nirvāṇa hope-fear free, aim obtained. Citation: suffering not in mind-itself, hope-fear-free appearance, stable wisdom, All-Good ones teach. Appearance-less mind-itself, single aspect appearance. Declarative assertion that saṃsāra-nirvāṇa distinctions are self-purified in primordial purity—not annihilated but recognized as never having been binding. Risk of nihilistic misreading as denial of appearance rather than recognition of appearance-emptiness unity.
