First instruction: awareness entering light (rig pa 'od la 'jug pa)—when looking outward at self-appearance (rang snang), place in state of knowing those appearances as self-appearance (rang snang du shes pa'i ngang la gzhag pa). As appearances dissolve through light-rays (zer thag) into one's own heart center (rang gi snying gar), this is called light entering awareness ('od rig pa la 'jug pa). This represents the first of three non-reversal instructions (phyir mi ldog pa'i gdams ngag) establishing recognition of appearances as awareness's own display.

<classification>
Recognizing one's face as primordial purity's own place (rang ngo ka dag gi rang sa ngo shes par byas pa)—ground obtained in that itself (sa zin), directly penetrating (zang thal). From that point forward no appearances whatsoever exist (de phan chad kyi snang ba gang yang med do). Definitive assertion: recognition establishes the ground without remainder. Rig pa is self (rang yin)—awareness is not object to be found but recognizing subject. Light ('od) radiates upon those external self-appearances (phyi'i rang snang de rnams la zer)—appearances are awareness's radiance, not external phenomena. Risk of reification: treating light-rays as physical emanations rather than metaphor for awareness-recognition.
