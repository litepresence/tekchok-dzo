[9223] <prose> First, the essence of the mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of the nature of Great Perfection, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[9224] <prose> When realizing that by sense-faculty,
[9225] <prose> When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties of the person—thus twelve portions.
[9226] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[9227] <tantra> At the time when the mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[9228] <tantra> Reach the end of the Great Perfection View.
[9229] <tantra> For the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties, three views arise.
[9230] <tantra> For the best sense-faculty, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising
[9231] <tantra> Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[9232] <tantra> At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean. || 10 ||
[9233] <tantra> Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting a sky-spear.
[9234] <tantra> Fruit is seeing the appearance of birthless self-arising.
[9235] <prose> The view of the middle sense-faculty
[9236] <prose> Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[9237] <prose> Intention is free from conceptual portions, like flags attaching to the ocean.
[9238] <prose> Conduct is unblocked spontaneous conduct, like a mad-one.
[9239] <prose> Conduct without obstruction in any appearance.
[9240] <prose> Fruit:
[9241] <prose> Endowed with intention of self-place, conquering signs.
[9242] <prose> The view of the last sense-faculty realizes this very appearance as like illusion or emanation. || 20 ||
[9243] <prose> Consequently, intention: demonstrating essence of self-appearance, understanding wisdom arising in the intermediate, like a lion-chick free from the womb-egg.
[9244] <prose> See interior wisdom obscured.
[9245] <prose> Conduct:
[9246] <prose> Endowed with conduct grasping saṃsāra-nirvāṇa two.
[9247] <prose> Fruit:
[9248] <prose> Having abandoned body, breath reaches the nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9249] <prose> Second, the essence of wisdom's general filling intention:
[9250] <prose> Realizing awareness's power-empowerment perfected from the beginning.
[9251] <prose> Different manners of realizing by three sense-faculties:
[9252] <tantra> From that same source: || 30 ||
[9253] <tantra> At the time when wisdom's general filling intention arises,
[9254] <tantra> Also, by the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties of the person, three view manners arise.
[9255] <tantra> The best sense-faculty realizes only by demonstrating birthless fruit as self-nature through empowerment.
[9256] <tantra> Intention:
[9257] <tantra> Through wisdom practice, spreading to bindu, unmoving from sky-equal great bliss intention.
[9258] <tantra> Conduct:
[9259] <tantra> Conduct without pure-impure in white-red awakening mind.
[9260] <tantra> Fruit:
[9261] <tantra> Seeing suchness of Buddha-family ground.
[9262] <prose> The view of the middle sense-faculty || 40 ||
[9263] <prose> Realizes only appearance becoming awareness's power.
[9264] <prose> Intention:
[9265] <prose> Abides undistracted in clarity, like sun-moon pair relating.
[9266] <prose> Conduct:
[9267] <prose> Conducting in true dharmatā yogin manner.
[9268] <prose> Fruit:
[9269] <prose> Obtaining birth-deathless suchness.
[9270] <prose> The view of the last sense-faculty
[9271] <prose> Realizes empowerment qualities all expanding and arising.
[9272] <prose> Intention: || 50 ||
[9273] <prose> Meditating relying on god-body with signs.
[9274] <prose> Conduct:
[9275] <prose> Conducting in dharmatā's display.
[9276] <prose> Fruit:
[9277] <prose> Obtaining Buddha through the gate of qualities. Thus it is spoken.
[9278] <prose> Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[9279] <prose> Buddhahood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[9280] <prose> Different by distinction of person's sense-faculty.
[9281] <tantra> From that:
[9282] <tantra> At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises, || 60 ||
[9283] <tantra> Also, for the best, middle, and last of three sense-faculties, three view-signs arise.
[9284] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[9285] <tantra> Like a meteor moving in the sky,
[9286] <tantra> Arising as wisdom-power quality,
[9287] <tantra> Realizes liberation in three moments.
[9288] <tantra> Intention:
[9289] <tantra> Abides pervasive to all open clarity, like sun arising in space-between.
[9290] <tantra> Conduct:
[9291] <tantra> Enjoys in pure complete wisdom-body.
[9292] <tantra> Fruit: Thus-come at primordially pure ground in three moments. || 70 ||
[9293] <prose> The view of the middle sense-faculty:
[9294] <prose> Realizes appearance of great leakless dharmatā bliss arising by gap.
[9295] <prose> Intention:
[9296] <prose> Seeing each special field of view in each moment,
[9297] <prose> Each special realization arises,
[9298] <prose> And seeing each dharmakāya appearance,
[9299] <prose> Abides in intention of heart's pure suchness.
[9300] <prose> Conduct:
[9301] <prose> Conducts non-dual with self-heart's light-ray.
[9302] <prose> Fruit: || 80 ||
[9303] <prose> Seeing self-awareness's appearance as birthless dharmakāya.
[9304] <prose> The view of the last sense-faculty:
[9305] <prose> In pure wisdom appearance,
[9306] <prose> Did I arise from that,
[9307] <prose> Or did that arise from me—realizes thus thinking.
[9308] <prose> Intention:
[9309] <prose> Abides without seeing agent in that very appearance.
[9310] <prose> Conduct:
[9311] <prose> Endowed with doubt and indecision conduct.
[9312] <prose> Fruit: || 90 ||
[9313] <prose> Obtaining fruit of breathing into nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9314] <prose> Fourth, the essence of sun-moon equal gap intention:
[9315] <prose> Realizing appearance-emptiness as equality without ceasing.
[9316] <break> <prose> Separated individually by sense-faculty.
[9317] <break> <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[9318] <tantra> At the time when sun-moon equal gap intention penetrates expanse,
[9319] <tantra> For the best, middle, and last of three sense-faculties, three view-signs arise.
[9320] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[9321] <tantra> Realizes wisdom as open.
[9322] <tantra> Intention: not separate from wisdom river's channel without ceasing. || 100 ||
[9323] <tantra> Conduct:

[9325] <tantra> Fruit:
[9326] <tantra> Obtaining fruit of method and wisdom two practice and release two, four aspects without gathering or separation.
[9327] <prose> Also, three view-signs of the middle sense-faculty:

[9329] <prose> Intention: abides in manner like sun-moon arising in space-between, nature of method and wisdom.
[9330] <prose> Conduct: conducts to white-red secret bindu of great bliss.
[9331] <prose> Fruit:
[9332] <prose> Obtaining fruit of Buddhahood in womb of five Buddha-families' practice. || 110 ||
[9333] <prose> Three view-signs of the last sense-faculty:
[9334] <prose> Realizes view indicating awakening mind seed by father-mother practice.
[9335] <prose> Intention:

[9339] <prose> Fruit:
[9340] <prose> Seizing tutelary deity's illusory body in intermediate,
[9341] <prose> Obtaining fruit of pure appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[9342] <prose> Fifth, the essence of ocean expanse-penetration intention: || 120 ||
[9343] <prose> Abiding in force-samādhi of nature as dharmatā equal-clear state.
[9344] <prose> Separated by individual sense-faculty.
[9345] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[9346] <tantra> At the time of ocean expanse-penetration intention,
[9347] <tantra> Also, three view-signs arise for three sense-faculties.
[9348] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[9349] <tantra> Realizes whatever appears by great wisdom's activity as self-appearance itself.
[9350] <tantra> Intention:
[9351] <tantra> Like being intoxicated by alcohol with small attachment to appearance.
[9352] <tantra> Conduct: || 130 ||
[9353] <prose> Conducting in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[9354] <prose> Fruit: obtaining fruit of wisdom arising as one-cut not abiding in appearance.
[9355] <prose> Three view-signs of the middle sense-faculty:
[9356] <prose> Realizing view as clear-open wisdom-body.
[9357] <prose> Intention:
[9358] <prose> Endowed with fierce, short duration like waterfall.
[9359] <prose> Conduct:
[9360] <prose> Endowed with conduct-object like awareness-vision, not all's conduct-object.
[9361] <prose> Fruit:
[9362] <prose> Obtaining certainty of reaching end to empty wisdom's heart-essence. || 140 ||
[9363] <prose> Three view-signs of the last sense-faculty:
[9364] <prose> View:
[9365] <prose> Desiring to abandon delusory appearance by gap.
[9366] <prose> Intention:
[9367] <prose> Abiding in god and human mind-holding.
[9368] <prose> Conduct:
[9369] <prose> Endowed with fabricated two-grasping conduct.
[9370] <prose> Fruit:
[9371] <prose> Obtaining god and human status. Thus it is spoken.
[9372] <prose> Third, summarizing meaning by aspect: || 150 ||
[9373] <prose> These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[9374] <prose> Arising of yogin's experience:
[9375] <prose> By mountain general meaning, transcending view of Great Perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[9376] <prose> By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding dharmatā in that manner.
[9377] <break> <prose> By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[9378] <break> <prose> By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.
[9379] <prose> By ocean expanse-penetration, stably hold ground at primordially pure ground of space-awareness.
[9380] <ornament> Also, first: like lion's play conquering fear of delusory appearance destruction, washed high by view.
[9381] <ornament> Second: Like king-awareness empowerment obtaining self-power dharmatā.
[9382] <ornament> Third: Like peacock chick emerging from egg, reaching pure space. || 160 ||
[9383] <ornament> Fourth: Like equal sun-moon without two, expanding greatly all-equal vastness.
[9384] <ornament> Fifth: establishing supreme secret bindu meaning gathered in intention like sun arising from mountain neck, self-appearance clear as wisdom.
[9385] <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:
[9386] <tantra> The intention of mountain's general meaning
[9387] <tantra> Is like lion's play.
[9388] <tantra> The intention of wisdom's general filling
[9389] <tantra> Is like empowerment from king's head.
[9390] <tantra> The intention of bindu's range-penetration is like peacock chick emerging from egg.
[9391] <tantra> The intention of sun-moon equal gap is like entering equality without sun and moon two.
[9392] <tantra> The intention of ocean's expanse-penetration || 170 ||
[9393] <tantra> Is like sun arising from mountain's neck. Thus it is spoken.
[9394] <prose> Thus, dividing each of the five aspirations into three sense-faculties makes fifteen. Dividing each of these into view, intention, conduct, and fruit fours makes sixty Dharma enumerations—purifying sixty enumerations of eon's increase-decrease, sentient beings' affliction, and view.
[9395] <prose> Demonstrated as pure complete nature of wisdom experience, spoken by Vajra-Holder.
[9396] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[9397] <prose> The twentieth chapter establishing the essential point of taking experience of spontaneous leap-over wisdom.
[9398] <prose> Thus having demonstrated all methods of taking experience through guidance method,
[9399] <break> <prose> Now extensively explaining the sequence of how to take experience through introduction has two aspects:
[9400] <break> <prose> Establishing all Dharmas by general introduction sequence,
[9401] <prose> And extensively explaining mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction.
[9402] <prose> First, the preparation preceding introduction: || 180 ||
[9403] <tantra> From two actual introductions,
