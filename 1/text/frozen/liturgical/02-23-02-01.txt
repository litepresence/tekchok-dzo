[12245] <prose> First, three aspects:
[12246] <prose> Contemplating the difficulty of obtaining, train in Dharma without leisure-freedom intermission.
[12247] <prose> The training procedure is explained.
[12248] <prose> Contemplating the cause of certain decay, always produce definite-emerge and weariness.
[12249] <prose> Contemplating the simile of certain death, meditate on profound meaning of emptiness when the time comes.
[12250] <prose> The first:
[12251] <verse> Difficult to be born: born in the place of Dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent.
[12252] <verse> Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments.
[12253] <verse> Difficult to meet: meeting Master Virtuous Friend.
[12254] <verse> Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy Dharma jewel. || 10 ||
[12255] <verse> Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong.
[12256] <verse> Difficult to abandon: abandoning saṃsāra's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's Buddha-continent—
[12257] <verse> now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible.
[12258] <verse> Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.
[12259] <tantra> From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:
[12260] <tantra> Remaining in favorable land,
[12261] <tantra> Relying on holy birth-beings,
[12262] <tantra> Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,
[12263] <tantra> You possess the four great wheels—thus.
[12264] <tantra> From the presence of Arya Shantideva: || 20 ||
[12265] <tantra> This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;
[12266] <tantra> For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,
[12267] <tantra> If effort is not made in this,
[12268] <tantra> Where will proper obtainment be later?
[12269] <tantra> Having obtained such leisure,
[12270] <tantra> If effort is not made now,
[12271] <tantra> Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;
[12272] <tantra> In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,
[12273] <tantra> Not even hearing the sound of happy path,
[12274] <tantra> What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said. || 30 ||
[12275] <prose> Moreover, that too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma.
[12276] <prose> Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power.
[12277] <prose> Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.
[12278] <prose> Possessing retinue, enjoyment, prosperity, always possessing autonomy and so forth.
[12279] <prose> Where to be born next also depends on present thought-conduct virtuous or non-virtuous.
[12280] <prose> Thus, those possessing the gathered accumulations, practicing giving, ethics and so forth, are born in happy path higher realm's world, high with retinue and prosperity.
[12281] <prose> Those abiding in patience, kindness and so forth, possessing beautiful forms.
[12282] <prose> Having made helper, protector-shelter, born in central land.
[12283] <prose> Honored by all, born without harm by others.
[12284] <prose> Those before who venerated Master and practiced Dharma. || 40 ||
[12285] <prose> Now meet true Master Virtuous Friend and practice Dharma.
[12286] <prose> Born in good land possessing all desires.
[12287] <prose> Those before who venerated Three Jewels, offering.
[12288] <prose> Here also well renounced.
[12289] <prose> Completed ordination, abiding in pure conduct until life's end.
[12290] <prose> Practicing holy vehicle Dharma.
[12291] <prose> Those before trained in hearing, contemplation, meditation.
[12292] <prose> Here also great wisdom, Dharma's limitless door, through hearing, contemplation and meditation accomplish self and others' two benefits and so forth, immeasurable qualities.
[12293] <prose> Those before who did evil, non-virtuous karma, here also born in various lower paths.
[12294] <prose> Even obtaining higher realm, incomplete faculties and so forth, poor, born with little merit. || 50 ||
[12295] <prose> Here also practicing non-virtue, later too born in suffering class.
[12296] <prose> In brief, previous life whatever done, known through present body-mind's pleasure-pain and aspects.
[12297] <prose> Where born next depends on present thought-conduct.
[12298] <prose> From the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:
[12299] <prose> <sutra>Before, what done, look at present body;</sutra>
[12300] <prose> <sutra>Where going next, look at present mind—thus.</sutra>
[12301] <prose> Thus thinking, now abandon non-virtue, accomplish virtue, always abide mind in holy Dharma.
[12302] <prose> For Dharma alone benefits; other than Dharma, nothing reaches benefit.
[12303] <prose> From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[12304] <prose> <sutra>Here father, mother, relatives,</sutra> || 60 ||
[12305] <prose> <sutra>Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;</sutra>
[12306] <prose> <sutra>Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.</sutra>
[12307] <prose> <sutra>Except these quality-possessors,</sutra>
[12308] <prose> <sutra>No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.</sutra>
[12309] <prose> From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[12310] <prose> <sutra>As time's danger, king becoming to go,</sutra>
[12311] <prose> <sutra>Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;</sutra>
[12312] <prose> <sutra>Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,</sutra>
[12313] <prose> <sutra>Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.</sutra>
[12314] <prose> Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: || 70 ||
[12315] <prose> Thus, having obtained such difficult leisure, — yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded,
[12316] <prose> like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation Dharma.
[12317] <prose> Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion?
[12318] <prose> From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[12319] <tantra> In coarse element forms,
[12320] <tantra> Alas, no ground to sit;
[12321] <tantra> To birth-being's stable life breath,
[12322] <tantra> Alas, time does not strike;
[12323] <tantra> In group six's object appearance,
[12324] <tantra> Alas, nothing permanent; || 80 ||
[12325] <tantra> In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[12326] <tantra> Alas, nothing exhausts;
[12327] <tantra> In suffering arisen from body,
[12328] <tantra> Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[12329] <prose> Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused.
[12330] <prose> Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others?
[12331] <prose> Enemies conquered?
[12332] <prose> Lands obtained?
[12333] <prose> Whatever done, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
[12334] <prose> Thus though impermanent, || 90 ||
[12335] <prose> grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused.
[12336] <prose> Thinking from heart: self must not become like that.
[12337] <prose> By self benefit given to others?
[12338] <prose> Enemies conquered?
[12339] <prose> Lands obtained?
[12340] <prose> Whatever done, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
[12341] <tantra> From the presence of Glorious Atisha:
[12342] <tantra> Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
[12343] <tantra> All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
[12344] <tantra> Whatever is thought, benefit not reached— || 100 ||
[12345] <tantra> Habituate looking at self's mind,
[12346] <tantra> Like thus requested.
[12347] <prose> Even if liberated at the basis-ground, one may revert,
[12348] <prose> For that basis, though confusion may arise, is posited from the aspect of delusion.
[12349] <prose> Because it is the basis of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[12350] <prose> The liberation-place itself is the first, it is said.
