[12787] <prose> For producing the strength of body, speech, and mind,
[12788] <prose> The wise one does this together with breath; || 10 ||
[12789] <prose> By doing thus again and again,
[12790] <prose> That appearance becomes like this:
[12791] <prose> If obtaining the strength of the body,
[12792] <prose> Bestow the instructions;
[12793] <prose> Yet if consciousness becomes clear,
[12794] <prose> Place it equally in its own meaning;

[12805] <prose> Important: meditate by producing effort in not dying now. Sixth, showing birth-place signs: warmth dissolving to the crown, certainly giving breath as the excellent primordially-pure, middle intermediate state, last Emanation-Body. Ordinary birth-beings give breath by birth in higher realms. That also: at the time of death, the eye becomes obscured, warmth gathering to the genitals, birth toward the animal realm. Hand moving right, warmth gathering to the crown, a god. Words confused, warmth gathering in the right armpit, an asura. Left foot moving, striking the earth, warmth gathering to the foot-sole, a hell being. Body yellow, luster non-existent, warmth gathering to the throat, a hungry ghost. Words clear, memory not lost, warmth gathering in the eye, birth in the human birth-place.

[12807] <break> <prose> Also from that same text:
[12808] <break> <prose> || 30 ||
[12809] <break> <verse> Outer appearance like this:
[12810] <prose> If warmth dissolves upward,
[12811] <prose> One becomes giving great breath;
[12812] <prose> If the eye is unclear, obscured,
[12813] <prose> Birth toward the negative-path places.
[12814] <prose> If the hands move right,
[12815] <prose> That person goes to the god's place;
[12816] <prose> If words are confused from the mouth,
[12817] <prose> Birth like that in the asura place;
[12818] <prose> Left foot striking the earth, || 40 ||
[12819] <prose> That is in the hell's place;
[12820] <prose> Body's color yellow, luster not existent,
[12821] <prose> That is in the hungry-ghost land;
[12822] <prose> If uttering birth-being sounds from the mouth,
[12823] <prose> That is in the animal place;
[12824] <prose> Also or mouth mute, teeth closed,
[12825] <prose> The animal birth-place is like that;
[12826] <prose> If words are clear, memory not lost,
[12827] <prose> That is in the human's place.
[12828] <prose> Outer signs are those, join these inner signs: || 50 ||
[12829] <prose> Warmth gathering in the crown, that is in the god's place;
[12830] <prose> Like that warmth gathering in the foot-sole, that is in the hell's place;
[12831] <prose> Warmth gathering in the right armpit, that is in the asura land;
[12832] <prose> Like that warmth gathering in the throat, that person is born in the hungry-ghost place;
[12833] <prose> Like that warmth gathering in the genitals, that is the animal birth-place;
[12834] <prose> Warmth gathering in the eye, that is birth in the human's place.
[12835] <prose> Thus whoever possesses these signs, this is certain only—thus.
[12836] <prose> 
[12837] <tantra> From among those, especially at birth toward animals: warmth gathering to the genitals, teeth closed, or various animal voices uttered from the mouth, or the eye being covered by dust-eye appearance—these are explained as outer-inner signs meeting.

[12842] <prose> Seventh, three in the birth-place purifying rite: purifying at the time of death, purifying on the corpse, purifying afterward. First, from <tantra> Sun-Moon Union:
[12843] <prose> 
[12844] <verse> By the preparation of the letter A,
[12845] <prose> Join breath and that number;
[12846] <prose> If not dying in that interval,
[12847] <prose> By breath placing the mouth toward the crown,
[12848] <prose> Also in the body's center by consciousness, || 70 ||
[12849] <prose> Focus on A and gather.
[12850] <prose> 
[12851] <prose> Thus: at the time of possessing a rite like that, if that person's breath is not separated, by the letter together with breath, purify the remaining without doubt—thus. This method is explained for pulling most goers not seeing this Dharma's door toward higher realms.
[12852] <prose> 
[12853] <prose> Imagine a sphere of white light like an egg inside that person's heart; do paired focus as that goes upward and upward; the self also focuses on that consciousness become like that; reciting A with tone together for a short time, joining with that person's age, breath going outward long; at the time of breath gasping, placing the mouth toward that crown, reciting A A thus twenty-one times, steam comes whistle-ru-ru; even an evil one is sent to higher realms; also one possessing intellect and view meditation is sent to dharmatā.
[12854] <prose> 
[12855] <prose> If one possessing the sign of birth toward hell, at the time of separating from breath, focus that consciousness as A in the heart place or navel, melting by fire as five lights, remaining self's upper garment for a moment, send to the place above. Hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, gods, and humans also, send from above to above; birth toward human, send to liberation.
[12856] <prose> 
[12857] <prose> Rite of giving benefit by the method of obtaining above bliss without experiencing below suffering. That also: if dying when focus continues, send to above.

[12859] <prose> 
[12860] <prose> ### PAGE 299
[12861] <prose> 
[12862] <prose> If complete, like before.
[12863] <prose> 
[12864] <prose> Second, purifying on the corpse:
[12865] <prose> In front of the corpse, make a Maṇḍala of two cubits, etc., sprinkle with saffron and other pleasant fragrances, draw a beautiful eight-petaled lotus in the center, place a jewel or clay vase transformed by white earth, with ornamented neck, garland, and cord, filled with pure water together with vase substances, four A's written with vermilion or safflower on the four sides.
[12866] <prose> 
[12867] <prose> Imagine the vase as a five-light palace of the dimension of Samantabhadra, Teacher, blue, in equipoise, father-mother, in the quarters and intermediate quarters the Five Families' Buddhas, above the lineage Gurus; invite in an instant, absorb, and recite Oṃ Āḥ Hūṃ Svāhā and A one hundred thousand times for approach;
[12868] <prose> || 90 ||
[12869] <prose> At intervals, recite Oṃ Ābhya rgataṃ keṃ, "So-and-so's negativity and obscurations all śāntiṃ kuru ye svāhā,"
[12870] <prose> 
[12871] <prose> Holding the cord, self imagined as Vajrasattva, light-rays coiling around the cord go, from the Guru and each Deity's body portion nectar descends, filling the vase; offer and praise according to knowledge;
[12872] <prose> 
[12873] <prose> Finally, by saying A A, the Jñānasattva departs;
[12874] <prose> Imagine the Samayasattva dissolving into water;
[12875] <prose> Place that vase on the corpse's crown;
[12876] <prose> Recite A according to age;
[12877] <prose> Imagine that vase water as a stream of Jñāna water, washing with A included, imagine obscurations purified, by reciting A much,
[12878] <prose> Certain to be sent from the hell realms. || 100 ||
[12879] <prose> 
[12880] <prose> Then hold the vase at the throat, wash with BHYA according to age, sent from hungry ghosts.
[12881] <prose> 
[12882] <prose> Then hold the vase at the secret place, washing with RGYA and wind joined, sent from animals.
[12883] <prose> 
[12884] <prose> Then hold the vase at the armpit, recite KEṂ and wash, sent from asuras.
[12885] <prose> 
[12886] <prose> Then hold the vase at the crown, recite TAṂ and wash, sent from the god realms.
