[3709] <prose> First, viewing outer phenomena, one sees phenomena as without self-nature.
[3710] <prose> Moreover, viewing phenomena in parts with the vajra-eye, one sees appearance as the eight similes of illusion,
[3711] <prose> Realizing that delusion is not truly established, without doubt of returning to the three realms—mind at ease.
[3712] <prose> Viewing particular phenomena with the eye of prajñā,
[3713] <prose> Realizing conventional appearance as groundless, great primordial purity—
[3714] <prose> Mind at ease, obtaining rigpa without action imprints or latencies.
[3715] <prose><tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[3716] <prose> The outer view is like this:
[3717] <prose> Regarding objects that appear as referents,
[3718] <verse> Whoever becomes familiar with them as without self-nature,
[3719] <verse> By this, appearance and emptiness are non-dual.
[3720] <verse> The six collections unobstructed, relaxed.
[3721] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3722] <prose><tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[3723] <prose> Regarding phenomena appearing as characteristics,
[3724] <verse> Sense-power of the eye not ceasing,
[3725] <verse> This is the excellent view of mind.
[3726] <verse> Self's own rigpa clear,
[3727] <verse> Miracle of outer appearance,
[3728] <verse> From the essence of concept-free clarity,
[3729] <verse> Knowing as great self-arisen—
[3730] <verse> This is the view of viewing phenomena.
[3731] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3732] <prose> Second, viewing inner dharmatā, one sees the absence of self-nature with the eye of wisdom,
[3733] <prose> Realizing that there is no mind of grasping even in self-awareness,
[3734] <prose> Mind at ease in the nature of exhausted dharmas.
[3735] <prose><tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[3736] <prose> Dharmatā, rigpa, without arising,
[3737] <verse> Concepts and characteristics naturally absent,
[3738] <verse> Rigpa without negation or affirmation—
[3739] <verse> Where is there clinging conduct?
[3740] <verse> Thinking of dharmatā
[3741] <verse> Should be known as the nature without doing.
[3742] <verse> Rigpa free from action and actor,
[3743] <verse> Not falling in any direction—
[3744] <verse> This is called great meditation.
[3745] <verse> Moreover, that which realizes is like this:
[3746] <verse> By the prajñā of single concept,
[3747] <verse> Mind becomes depth-confident, and
[3748] <verse> If dharmatā without arising is realized,
[3749] <verse> Great wisdom will arise.
[3750] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3751] <prose> Third, viewing secret rigpa, one sees non-duality of expanse and rigpa,
[3752] <prose> Definitively deciding that Buddha is not obtained by intellectual words.
[3753] <prose> Seeing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as primordially pure, exhausted dharmas—mind at ease.
[3754] <prose><tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[3755] <prose> Whoever sees expanse and rigpa,
[3756] <verse> By this, becomes familiar with the Buddha ground.
[3757] <verse> Beyond this, no other method,
[3758] <verse> Surpassing distinctions of mind-grasping.
[3759] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3760] <prose><tantra> From the Seng-ge Tsal Dzog:
[3761] <prose> The ultimate view of all Buddhas
[3762] <verse> Does not transcend the two: expanse and rigpa.
[3763] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3764] <prose> Having named such views, it is called the view of cutting the continuum of the city—
[3765] <prose> Cutting the continuum of the womb-city, not returning to the three realms, becoming Buddha in this very life.
[3766] <prose> Moreover, through excellent sense-power:
[3767] <prose> Best: this very one,
[3768] <prose> Intermediate: bardo,
[3769] <prose> Last: awakening as nature-emanation body.
[3770] <prose><tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[3771] <verse> For the best, the two births are not needed;
[3772] <verse> The intermediate, in between the two births.
[3773] <verse> The last, having exhaled the breath,
[3774] <verse> The emanator liberates their own continuum.
[3775] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3776] <prose> Second, regarding the essential point instruction for placing mountains:
[3777] <prose> All determined by view, uncorrupted, appearance in immediacy,
[3778] <prose> Placing rigpa in immediacy of rigpa,
[3779] <prose> The intentions of all vehicles gather there, seeing the meaning of all in that nature,
[3780] <prose> Others do not see this meaning.
[3781] <prose> For example, just as from the peak of the mountain king, lower valleys are seen simultaneously,
[3782] <prose> But from the valley the mountain peak is not seen,
[3783] <prose> So from the aspect of Great Perfection primordial liberation, spontaneously accomplished, realizing the preferences of the nine vehicles in one's own system,
[3784] <prose> Other vehicles do not realize this intention,
[3785] <prose> Completing the great liberation of the three realms.
[3786] <prose><tantra> From the Klong-drug-pa:
[3787] <verse> To mind that exists as view,
[3788] <verse> Appearance-existence self-arisen as one,
[3789] <verse> The three realms liberated in their own place.
