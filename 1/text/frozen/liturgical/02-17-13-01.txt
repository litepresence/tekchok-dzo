[3709] <prose> First, viewing outer phenomena, one sees phenomena as without self-nature.
[3710] <prose> Moreover, viewing phenomena in parts with the vajra-eye, one sees appearance as the eight similes of illusion,
[3711] <prose> Realizing that delusion is not truly established, without doubt of returning to the three realms—mind at ease.
[3712] <prose> Viewing particular phenomena with the eye of prajñā,
[3713] <prose> Realizing conventional appearance as groundless, great primordial purity—
[3714] <prose> Mind at ease, obtaining rigpa without action imprints or latencies.
[3715] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[3716] <prose> The outer view is like this:
[3717] <prose> Regarding objects that appear as referents,
[3718] <verse> Whoever becomes familiar with them as without self-nature,
[3719] <verse> By this, appearance and emptiness are non-dual.
[3720] <verse> The six collections unobstructed, relaxed.
[3721] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3722] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[3723] <prose> Regarding phenomena appearing as characteristics,
[3724] <verse> Sense-power of the eye not ceasing,
[3725] <verse> This is the excellent view of mind.
[3726] <verse> Self's own rigpa clear,
[3727] <verse> Miracle of outer appearance,
[3728] <verse> From the essence of concept-free clarity,
[3729] <verse> Knowing as great self-arisen—
[3730] <verse> This is the view of viewing phenomena.
[3731] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3732] <break>
[3733] <prose> Second, viewing inner dharmatā, one sees the absence of self-nature with the eye of wisdom,
[3734] <prose> Realizing that there is no mind of grasping even in self-awareness,
[3735] <prose> Mind at ease in the nature of exhausted dharmas.
[3736] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[3737] <prose> Dharmatā, rigpa, without arising,
[3738] <verse> Concepts and characteristics naturally absent,
[3739] <verse> Rigpa without negation or affirmation—
[3740] <verse> Where is there clinging conduct?
[3741] <verse> Thinking of dharmatā
[3742] <verse> Should be known as the nature without doing.
[3743] <verse> Rigpa free from action and actor,
[3744] <verse> Not falling in any direction—
[3745] <verse> This is called great meditation.
[3746] <verse> Moreover, that which realizes is like this:
[3747] <verse> By the prajñā of single concept,
[3748] <verse> Mind becomes depth-confident, and
[3749] <verse> If dharmatā without arising is realized,
[3750] <verse> Great wisdom will arise.
[3751] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3752] <break>
[3753] <prose> Third, viewing secret rigpa, one sees non-duality of expanse and rigpa,
[3754] <prose> Definitively deciding that Buddha is not obtained by intellectual words.
[3755] <prose> Seeing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as primordially pure, exhausted dharmas—mind at ease.
[3756] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[3757] <prose> Whoever sees expanse and rigpa,
[3758] <verse> By this, becomes familiar with the Buddha ground.
[3759] <verse> Beyond this, no other method,
[3760] <verse> Surpassing distinctions of mind-grasping.
[3761] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3762] <tantra> From the Seng-ge Tsal Dzog:
[3763] <prose> The ultimate view of all Buddhas
[3764] <verse> Does not transcend the two: expanse and rigpa.
[3765] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3766] <prose> Having named such views, it is called the view of cutting the continuum of the city—
[3767] <prose> Cutting the continuum of the womb-city, not returning to the three realms, becoming Buddha in this very life.
[3768] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[3769] <verse> For the best, the two births are not needed;
[3770] <verse> The intermediate, in between the two births.
[3771] <verse> The last, having exhaled the breath,
[3772] <verse> The emanator liberates their own continuum.
[3773] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3774] <break>
[3775] <prose> Second, regarding the essential point instruction for placing mountains:
[3776] <prose> All determined by view, uncorrupted, appearance in immediacy,
[3777] <verse> Rigpa placed in immediacy of rigpa,
[3778] <prose> The intentions of all vehicles gather there, seeing the meaning of all in that nature,
[3779] <prose> Others do not see this meaning.
[3780] <prose> For example, just as from the peak of the mountain king, lower valleys are seen simultaneously,
[3781] <prose> But from the valley the mountain peak is not seen,
[3782] <prose> So from the aspect of Great Perfection primordial liberation, spontaneously accomplished,
[3783] <prose> One realizes the preferences of the nine vehicles in one's own system;
[3784] <prose> Other vehicles do not realize this intention,
[3785] <prose> Completing the great liberation of the three realms.
[3786] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[3787] <verse> To mind that exists as view,
[3788] <verse> Appearance-existence self-arisen as one,
[3789] <verse> The three realms liberated in their own place.
[3790] <verse> This is the great self-placed Ati.
[3791] <verse> To mind that exists as placed,
[3792] <verse> Appearance self-placed, arising as ground,
[3793] <verse> In the view of the great equal placement,
[3794] <verse> Without seeking, it is perfected.
[3795] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3796] <break>
[3797] <prose> Third, the intention of the complete liberation of the three realms:
[3798] <verse> Thus viewed by the yogin who realizes,
[3799] <prose> There is nothing unliberated; transcending the very ground of bondage and liberation—
[3800] <prose> Great self-appearance without ground, seeing the nature of dream-illusion or sky.
[3801] <prose> This completes the intention of Klong-chen Equal to Space.
[3802] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[3803] <verse> To mind without arising and ceasing,
[3804] <verse> Unthought clear seeing appearing,
[3805] <verse> The intention of exhausted going and coming—
[3806] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[3807] <verse> To mind without grasping,
[3808] <verse> Unceasing pure appearance,
[3809] <verse> Great playful samādhi—
[3810] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[3811] <verse> To mind without holding,
[3812] <verse> Self-arisen great appearance,
[3813] <verse> Unceasing non-conceptual intention—
[3814] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[3815] <verse> To mind without affliction,
[3816] <verse> Appearance free of self-concept,
[3817] <verse> The intention of great self-placement—
[3818] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[3819] <verse> To mind without eternalism or nihilism,
[3820] <verse> Appearance free of good and bad,
[3821] <verse> The intention free of acceptance and rejection—
[3822] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[3823] <verse> To mind without adopting or rejecting,
[3824] <verse> Directionless self-liberated appearance,
[3825] <verse> The intention of great universal pervasion—
[3826] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[3827] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3828] <break>
[3829] <prose> Fourth, the result of afflictions pure in their place:
[3830] <prose> At that time, without abandoning afflictions, not dwelling in them,
[3831] <prose> Pure in place, like clouds dissolving in sky or sediment settling in water.
[3832] <prose> First, delusion not experienced;
[3833] <prose> Now, not dwelling in delusion;
[3834] <prose> Finally, delusion impossible—arriving at the ground.
[3835] <prose> This is called the person who has cast off dharmas.
[3836] <tantra> From the same text:
[3837] <verse> To mind of dharmatā-appearance,
[3838] <verse> Bliss and ego-grasping self-purified.
[3839] <verse> To mind of self-appearance,
[3840] <verse> Clinging thoughts self-purified.
[3841] <verse> To mind of no-self appearance,
[3842] <verse> Parts and aspects self-purified.
[3843] <verse> To mind of contaminated appearance,
[3844] <verse> Arisen elements self-purified.
[3845] <verse> To mind of uncontaminated appearance,
[3846] <verse> Deluded conditions, stains self-purified.
[3847] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3848] <break>
[3849] <prose> This is the result of demonstrating the view.
[3850] <prose> The fourth meaning: the yoga of continuous conduct regarding the result has four aspects:
[3851] <list> The result of naturally pure; the essential point instruction of placing rigpa; the intention of three realms pure as ground; the result of afflictions self-liberated.
