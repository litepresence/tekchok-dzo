[12351] <prose> Third, instruction for meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death: generally, impermanent compounded dharmas resemble dream, illusion, etc.
[12352] <break> <prose> <citation>From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:</citation>
[12353] <break> <invocation>Alas!</invocation> <verse> Compounded things are impermanent,
[12354] <break> <prose> Characteristics of dharmas of arising and perishing;
[12355] <break> <prose> Than becoming to perish after birth,
[12356] <prose> Therefore quick peace is bliss.
[12357] <prose> Like star, dust, eye-disease, lamp,
[12358] <prose> Magical-illusion, dew, water-bubble,
[12359] <prose> Dream, lightning, cloud—
[12360] <prose> Compounded dharmas resemble that—thus. || 10 ||
[12361] <prose> 
[12362] <prose> Especially, example of birth-being's impermanent life <tantra> from the Great Secret Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[12363] <verse> Whatever body-possessing birth-beings,
[12364] <prose> Life is impermanent like dream,
[12365] <prose> By dream establishment not exists;
[12366] <prose> Life impermanent like rushing-water,
[12367] <prose> By falling-water not exist sitting as one;
[12368] <prose> Life like grasp-not wind,
[12369] <prose> By wind birth-being seize not;
[12370] <prose> Life like short-duration emanation, || 20 ||
[12371] <prose> By emanation always remain not;
[12372] <prose> Life like true-not magical-illusion,
[12373] <prose> By magical-illusion true ground seize not;
[12374] <prose> Life like not-staying traveler,
[12375] <prose> By traveler always sit not;
[12376] <prose> Life like not-certain rain-cloud,
[12377] <prose> By cloud time seize not.
[12378] <prose> Thus birth-being's life extent
[12379] <prose> Is thus not certain as one,
[12380] <prose> Sudden and thunder-fall, || 30 ||
[12381] <prose> Time thus not seized—thus.
[12382] <prose> 
[12383] <prose> <citation>From the Extensive Play Sutra:</citation>
[12384] <verse> Life impermanent like play's cloud,
[12385] <prose> Like mountain-cascade falling-water goes quick fast
[12386] <prose> —thus.
[12387] <prose> <citation>From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:</citation>
[12388] <verse> Some remain in womb then die,
[12389] <prose> Likewise some after birth
[12390] <prose> Some at only stopping cough, likewise some completely running, some old and some young, some dying after descending into youth—in that, thus "this human is young," what pride-confidence of the alive || 40 ||
[12391] <break> <prose> —thus.
[12392] <break> <prose> 
[12393] <prose> Thus thinking certain quick death by impermanence: this life's activity—attachment-aversion, fight-quarrel, laziness, hoard-store, great year-wish difference, faction side-grasp, enemy-friend subdue-protect, hearing yet word-explain not fitting meaning, and all friends—what benefit? Thus must think from heart. To do speech:
[12394] <prose> Life's extent also not known how much;
[12395] <prose> Like goose taking milk from water,
[12396] <prose> Do accept self's desire—thus.
[12397] <prose> 
[12398] <prose> Thus: from today, need effort in profound Dharma. That too, also looking at outer object's appearance, continuous impermanent by sun-moon-time-four change; moment impermanent by day-night moment change; nature impermanent by thinking birth-death sequence-row; thinking on gathered-yet-separate like shop traveler; quickly die, certainly die, when die opportunity not exist, thus thinking dharma-not-by benefit not exist.
[12399] <prose> Inner self's illusion-body youth, mind's arise-door, pleasure-pain sequence-rows changing before-after, thus also thinking impermanent, not-stable, changing, transferring, as not having example of returning after death. Thinking death only without being distracted moment-instant.
[12400] <prose> <citation>From Conduct Entrance:</citation> || 50 ||
[12401] <verse> Day and night all in, by self,
[12402] <break> <prose> Appropriate to think this only—thus.
[12403] <break> <prose> 
[12404] <prose> That too, meditating samadhi in interval of mind not turned from this life, and though putting other Dharma exercise of doing, need to think this only from heart, for no Dharma more profound than this for turning mind from saṃsāra.
[12405] <prose> <citation>From the presence of Master Great Padma also...</citation>
[12406] <verse> Consequently, give urge by death impermanent without distraction; day and night divided in sessions, always do meditation—like thus said.
[12407] <prose> 
[12408] <prose> Therefore, though thinking long in existence attachment-decay, life impermanent; though thinking in near moment-instant, life impermanent. Faculty and object impermanent, situation changes; retainer and wealth substance impermanent, now exist yet now not exist; father, mother, relative impermanent, not exist after passing; land person and neighbor impermanent, many separations; sun, moon, old, young impermanent, appearance changes; pleasure-pain and enemy friend impermanent, like traveler-house.
[12409] <prose> In short, all birth-beings put pillow in birth-death, wear pleasure-pain garment, spread grasping-grasped seat, take ignorance bed, sleep self-grasping sleep, dream latent-tendency dream. All goers exercising in five poisons' self-nature in three realms' saṃsāra house, also sleeping and arising, in sleep and dream without beginning-end and wake time—think this.
[12410] <prose> Now from saṃsāra's darkness-house, need to bring out effort in liberation's method. || 60 ||
[12411] <verse> Samsara arises through the power of karma and affliction,
[12412] <prose> Though impermanent manifests, grasp as true;
[12413] <prose> Though fallen in birth-death's water-fall, liberation not known;
[12414] <break> <prose> Though experience various sufferings, no time to forget;
[12415] <prose> True friend separate, no protector showing path,
[12416] <prose> Dharma's eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness.
[12417] <break> <prose> Thinking these, in difficult-to-obtain leisure,
[12418] <prose> Appropriate to produce joy-mind or accomplish Dharma;
[12419] <prose> Supreme become guide showing true path,
[12420] <break> <prose> Having met mark-possessing masters, || 70 ||
[12421] <break> <prose> At this time obtaining profound Dharma supreme nectar,
[12422] <prose> By effort accomplish, crossing supreme other-side of existence-three ocean.
[12423] <prose> Life impermanent like setting-mountain's shadow,
[12424] <prose> Like precipice-edge tree moved by wind,
[12425] <prose> Like cloud and lightning, grass-tip dew,
[12426] <prose> Think to die quickly as self.
[12427] <prose> If now "die" not remembered from heart,
[12428] <prose> Benefit not reached at die-time by laziness-distraction;
[12429] <prose> Therefore now like falling to beginning,
[12430] <prose> Train in essence-meaning by fear-terror. || 80 ||
[12431] <tantra> From now, self also in flower forest,
[12432] <prose> Empty by birth-beings, hearing falling-water's sound,
[12433] <prose> Dwelling near solitary, mind-pleasing cliff-mountain,
[12434] <prose> Mind of "not existent essence in four times" virtue,
[12435] <prose> Cultivated by world person as ornament-cause,
[12436] <prose> Having obtained supreme nectar than all,
[12437] <prose> May proclaim great sound of impermanent empty!
[12438] <break> <verse> There in beautiful medicine tree flower grove,
[12439] <prose> Possessing cloud canopy of peaceful Dharma manner,
[12440] <break> <prose> By flickering gold light of awareness-holder conqueror, || 90 ||
[12441] <prose> May one life's clear-light essence be accomplished!
[12442] <tantra> From liberation's mansion jewel palace,
[12443] <prose> By resounding tone of peaceful Dharma manner drum sound,
[12444] <prose> All goers not remaining wake from ignorance sleep,
[12445] <prose> May manifestly Buddha in original ground!
[12446] <prose> The clear-natured one with weariness-mind,
[12447] <prose> Desiring to go one-along to peaceful forest,
[12448] <prose> Speaking tone of wished words from heart:
[12449] <prose> May quickly accomplish by pure faith virtue!
[12450] <prose> Thus called are interval verses. || 100 ||
[12451] <prose> 
[12452] <prose> Second, examining death's signs <tantra> from the Thalgyur:
[12453] <verse> Death's signs also twenty-one;
[12454] <prose> Gone to solitary charnel-ground direction,
[12455] <prose> Do worship and give to master;
[12456] <prose> Also by eating and drinking,
[12457] <prose> Do please other goers;
[12458] <tantra> From that, also examine outer, inner, secret death signs—thus said.
[12459] <prose> 
[12460] <prose> All ordinary not knowing when die, || 110 ||
[12461] <prose> Transcended in distinction from world outsiders examining by divination, pra, etc.;
[12462] <prose> Yogin's seizing time certainly:
[12463] <prose> Gone to person-not-exist valley empty, retreat, charnel-ground, forest-retreat, mountain valley, etc., doing life form examination, etc.
[12464] <tantra> From Sun-Moon Union:
[12465] <verse> At the time of death-lord demon rising,
[12466] <prose> Thus examine death-time intermediate state;
[12467] <prose> In solitary place or valley empty,
[12468] <prose> Precious to seize death's time
[12469] <prose> —thus.
[12470] <prose> || 120 ||
[12471] <prose> Examining actual: from uncommon and common.
[12472] <prose> First, from that self: form-reflection in sky's space, becoming impermanent and dissolving, moon-form not existing is death. Limb four break in four months; above that head break in three months; upper lower divide in two months; roll in fist in one month—know that time.
[12473] <prose> Sky-earth two's connection-rope: if becoming cut, not able more than nineteen days. From Meru's sides, not falling from white lion, not liberated by sixteen days. If at mountain and plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree waist breaks—these also examine by wise one.
[12474] <prose> Spontaneously accomplished, it is said.
[12475] <prose> Because each self realizes,
[12476] <prose> Not realized by other's conditions.
[12477] <prose> Thus three aspects realized, know.
[12478] <prose> For showing path, essence sharp.
[12479] <prose> Power wisdom compassion by,
[12480] <prose> Suffering afflictions abandon. || 130 ||
[12481] <break> <prose> First three self-benefit,
[12482] <break> <prose> Later three other-benefit.
[12483] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[12484] <prose> 
[12485] <break> <prose> In its commentary:
[12486] <break> <prose> Thus extremely wonderful and inconceivable object Buddha,
[12487] <prose> Without hearing from others, self teacherless self-arisen wisdom indescribable nature completely manifests.
[12488] <prose> After that realization, those lacking realization blind become,
[12489] <break> <prose> For them to realize,
[12490] <break> <prose> For showing path, || 140 ||
[12491] <prose> Unsurpassed wisdom,

[12493] <break> <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[12494] <prose> Such Teacher before all, attaining enlightenment,

[12498] <break> <prose> Field and activity: dharmadhatu and space limit, sentient beings and Buddhas appearance whatever extent.
[12499] <prose> Third topic: non-recognition sentient beings' confusion manner:
[12500] <prose> First basis confusion not existing, || 150 ||
[12501] <prose> Basis appearing, self-face non-recognition awareness neutral awareness-rooted that,
[12502] <prose> Basis appearance divided, sentient beings confused.
[12503] <prose> Existence and non-existence two arise,
[12504] <prose> Called general confusion-basis,
[12505] <prose> Because non-recognition itself mixed.
[12506] <prose> Knowable itself also appears as stain.
[12507] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[12508] <prose> Dharmakāya like sky,
[12509] <prose> Adventitious sentient beings cloud-covered.
[12510] <prose> Non-confused dharmatā also, || 160 ||
[12511] <prose> In mind appears as confusion.
[12512] <prose> With causes and conditions, momentary.
[12513] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[12514] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's heart mirror Tantra:
[12515] <prose> Three realms' sentient beings all
[12516] <break> <tantra> From basis-whatever-not from whatever confused.
[12517] <break> <prose> That basis essence empty,
[12518] <prose> Nature clear,
[12519] <prose> Compassion sentient beings appearing capable.
[12520] <prose> There, grasping-awareness from non-recognition aspect arising, binding only, || 170 ||
[12521] <prose> Awareness blind father from I arise.
