[10548] <ornament> First: Regarding the purpose of demonstrating that mere unceasing display cannot constitute the true recognition of liberation from saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[10549] <prose> The position holding that the ground of those two—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—is mere unceasing display is thus also unreasonable upon analysis.
[10550] <prose> If rigpa were merely unceasing display without recognition, it would be unreasonable for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa to arise and cease without any recognition of its own face.
[10551] <prose> Or alternatively, who among sentient beings would ever become liberated without recognizing their own nature whatsoever?
[10552] <prose> If cause and effect were both primordially spontaneously accomplished from the very beginning without any dependence on recognition,
[10553] <prose> Then cause and effect would necessarily exist simultaneously as one essence, rendering all distinction meaningless.
[10554] <prose> If one accepts this position, then when the cause is established as saṃsāra,
[10555] <prose> The effect would clearly not be able to manifest as nirvāṇa, for they would be identical.
[10556] <prose> If those two—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—were truly one essence, then saṃsāra would necessarily follow wherever nirvāṇa is present.
[10557] <prose> And nirvāṇa following upon saṃsāra would cause those two to be one without distinction—an absurd consequence. || 10 ||
[10558] <prose> If one accepts this identity, they cannot be separate in any meaningful way.
[10559] <prose> Clearly, pure and impure cannot exist simultaneously as cause and effect if they are one substance.
[10560] <prose> Because of these and many other logical faults, the position of mere unceasing display as the ground does not abide under scrutiny.
[10561] <tantra> From the Klongdrukpa, treasury of the Great Perfection:
[10562] <tantra> Mere spontaneous display being posited as the ground of all variety,
[10563] <tantra> Is truly not the correct recognition of liberation.
[10564] <tantra> If it were, it would necessarily become like this:
[10565] <tantra> These sentient beings, without any effort or practice,
[10566] <tantra> Would never attain liberation itself from confusion.
[10567] <tantra> Non-recognition of one's own face becomes the cause of continued obscuration. || 20 ||
[10568] <tantra> If mere awareness existing were said to be sufficient cause for liberation,
[10569] <tantra> Then the effect—liberation—also would not become distinct from ordinary existence.
[10570] <tantra> For example, just as charcoal piled upon black earth,
[10571] <tantra> Cannot be cleaned to appear as pure white by any effort.
[10572] <tantra> Like color that cannot change its fundamental nature,
[10573] <tantra> Cause and effect would remain forever separate without connection.
[10574] <prose> Again, mere unceasing display cannot truly constitute the authentic recognition of realization,
[10575] <prose> For if cause and effect were established as truly one without distinction,
[10576] <prose> Then recognition and resting in one's own nature would become entirely unnecessary, rendering the direct path meaningless.
[10577] <prose> Therefore, to merely name unceasing display as the ground without understanding its true relation to primordial purity || 30 ||
[10578] <prose> Is not a meaning that can be genuinely understood or established through direct recognition.
[10579] <prose> Samantabhadra, the Primordial Buddha, spoke these words to me:
[10580] <tantra> "O great bodhisattva, thus has the Teacher declared to the assembly,
[10581] <tantra> According to your own understanding and realization,
[10582] <tantra> This teaching of unceasing display as the sole ground exists merely among the conventional dharmas that can be known by the intellect,
[10583] <tantra> And is not itself the correct essence of the ultimate recognition."
[10584] <prose> Thus it is declared.
[10585] <prose> The second position is also established and refuted in this manner:
[10586] <prose> Because the nature of awareness is not established as any definite entity, it remains uncertain and indeterminate;
[10587] <prose> Because conditions transform and alter it in every moment, it remains uncertain without fixed nature. || 40 ||
[10588] <tantra> From the Semde teachings, the Mind Section of the Great Perfection, it is said:
[10589] <tantra> "From the manifold names and designations given to uncertainty,
[10590] <tantra> The meaning too is merely labels, empty in themselves like echoes.
[10591] <tantra> Because the nature is not determined as singular or fixed,
[10592] <tantra> Whatever label is applied through convention, appears accordingly without inherent reality."
[10593] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[10594] <prose> Second, the thorough refutation of that position holding uncertainty as the ground:
[10595] <prose> If the ground were truly one essence, it could not simultaneously be non-one—a direct logical contradiction; harm comes through reasoning about the impossibility of separate substances being one.
[10596] <prose> If that uncertain ground were truly the cause-base from which saṃsāra arises, it would be clearly determined in itself as the cause of confusion through its own assertion.
[10597] <prose> Conversely, if it were truly the ground of nirvāṇa, this too would be clearly established as determined in a contradictory manner. || 50 ||
[10598] <prose> Moreover, if that ground were established as inherently pure, impurity could not possibly arise from it; thus accepting both alternation between purity and impurity and fundamental uncertainty causes direct logical contradiction.
[10599] <prose> Moreover, proceeding logically from purity, impurity would also necessarily revert to purity, eliminating all distinction.
[10600] <prose> Because the ground would remain uncertain without any determinate ground or established nature.
[10601] <prose> Also, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would mutually mix together without distinction, destroying the path and fruition.
[10602] <prose> The ground being fundamentally uncertain means it changes in every regard without any stability;
[10603] <prose> Consequently, if one accepts this position, all sentient beings would be liberated without any effort or practice whatsoever,
[10604] <prose> While conversely, fully awakened Buddhas would revert to impure confusion, once again engaging with suffering.
[10605] <prose> Moreover, that ground would necessarily follow as a possession of mind rather than mind's true nature; thus asserting only uncertainty would itself constitute a form of determination, contradicting the original claim.
[10606] <prose> Many faults such as these and more would necessarily arise from this position.
[10607] <tantra> From the Klong drug pa, profound treasury of Great Perfection teachings: || 60 ||
[10608] <tantra> "The ground taught as fundamentally uncertain and indeterminate—
[10609] <tantra> This too cannot truly constitute the authentic ground of reality.
[10610] <break> <tantra> I understand at this level of intelligence and analysis
[10611] <break> <tantra> That effects must necessarily possess alternation and change,
[10612] <tantra> Or become endowed with reversion to their cause.
[10613] <tantra> The uncertain itself becomes determined through its own existence,
[10614] <tantra> And thus the uncertain becomes determined despite claims otherwise.
[10615] <tantra> Because uncertainty must exist in itself to be asserted,
[10616] <tantra> Being determined would be like the exhaustion of all possible action.
[10617] <tantra> Are not all these knowable dharmas clear to the intelligent? || 70 ||
[10618] <tantra> The Teacher has spoken thus regarding this fault."
[10619] <prose> Thus it is definitively established.
[10620] <prose> The third position is also expressed in this manner by proponents of philosophical views:
[10621] <prose> Because the essence of awareness does not change in its nature, it is like space itself—pervasive and unchanging;
[10622] <prose> Appearances, being unable to change in their fundamental nature, are accepted as determined and fixed, like the nature of fire and water.
[10623] <prose> Second, the thorough logical refutation of that position:
[10624] <prose> If the essence of awareness does not change in any way and appearances likewise cannot change,
[10625] <prose> Then saṃsāra arising from that unchanging ground is not logically valid,
[10626] <prose> And consequently no one could possibly attain liberation from what never arose.
[10627] <prose> If nirvāṇa existed primordially as an unchanging essence, there would be no difference from the eternalists' view of permanence maintained by non-Buddhist philosophers; accepting liberation arising from causes and conditions would directly contradict this position. || 80 ||
[10628] <prose> Furthermore, if one accepts that the essence of saṃsāra, already being nirvāṇa in itself, does not change,
[10629] <prose> Then if the essence itself is already nirvāṇa without change, liberation through practice would not be necessary at all—
[10630] <prose> Just as fire, being hot by its very nature, requires no change or effort to become hot.
[10631] <prose> If one says this analysis is necessary only regarding mental appearances and not the ground itself,
[10632] <prose> This contradicts the fundamental position that appearances cannot change if the ground is unchanging.
[10633] <prose> Being that the appearance of saṃsāra itself manifests from the ground,
[10634] <prose> If one says it is not the appearance of the ground but something separate,
[10635] <prose> It necessarily follows that that ground would possess duality—appearing and not appearing—which is absurd.
[10636] <prose> Because the appearance of saṃsāra exists separate from the ground itself in this view, creating duality where none should exist.
[10637] <prose> Moreover, if one realizes that basis and accepts determination, it cannot constitute the authentic ground that transcends all extremes. || 90 ||
[10638] <prose> If a ground of realization were to exist inherently before realization itself occurs,
[10639] <prose> Then a merely cognizing mind arises independently, and thus realization does not depend upon realizing the ground—making realization meaningless.
[10640] <prose> Yet the ground depends upon the mind of realization to be known, creating circular dependence.
[10641] <prose> Because realization must exist beforehand to realize the ground, this logical error pervades the entire position.
[10642] <prose> If what is not realized is also claimed to be the ground, what knows it to be the ground?
[10643] <prose> Wherein, if ordinary mind knows it, then not realizing it also becomes the ground—rendering all distinction meaningless.
[10644] <prose> Perceive also the many faults that follow logically from this untenable position.
[10645] <tantra> From the Klong drug pa, treasury of Dzogchen instructions:
[10646] <tantra> "Regarding the determined ground that is taught by some proponents,
[10647] <tantra> This too is not the correct essence of the authentic basis. || 100 ||
[10648] <tantra> Just as for those with the eye disease of yellowing vision,
[10649] <tantra> A pure white conch appears mistakenly as yellow,
[10650] <tantra> Through the distinction of reversion to oneself and other,
[10651] <tantra> Self and other are free of the two extremes of determination.
[10652] <tantra> Therefore that view too is not correct upon analysis.
[10653] <tantra> Or, because cause is determined and effect is determined as identical,
[10654] <tantra> The self becomes no different from the eternalist view of permanence.
[10655] <tantra> Are not these knowable dharmas apparent to the wise?
[10656] <tantra> What was said before accords with what has been shown here."
[10657] <prose> Thus it is definitively established by reasoning. || 110 ||
[10658] <prose> The fourth position is also expressed by proponents of this view:
[10659] <prose> The essence is not divided into directions or categories in its true nature,
[10660] <prose> While appearances are changeable in whatever manner through conditions.
[10661] <prose> Second, the logical refutation of that untenable position:
[10662] <prose> If the ground were truly changeable in its essence, pure enlightened Buddhas would devolve into impure confusion.
[10663] <prose> Furthermore, whoever accepts this unacceptable consequence follows that sentient beings, without any effort or practice, spontaneously change into Buddhas and are liberated.
[10664] <prose> Also, effect would illogically revert to cause, destroying temporal sequence.
[10665] <prose> Because it would be a ground of fundamental change rather than stability.
[10666] <prose> Earth and other material elements would become awareness, and
[10667] <prose> Awareness would also devolve into matter—absurd consequences. || 120 ||
[10668] <prose> Moreover, if that which is not divided into categories of essence in the ground itself changes,
[10669] <prose> Or if appearances other than essence change,
[10670] <prose> If the essence itself changes, essence cannot coherently be called the ground.
[10671] <prose> Because it would change into a dharma other than the authentic ground.
[10672] <prose> If appearances other than essence change, the essence itself would be damaged by changing somewhere, compromising its integrity.
[10673] <prose> Also, one must ask: does the permanent change, or
[10674] <prose> Does the impermanent change in this view?
[10675] <prose> The permanent cannot change by definition, like space which remains unaltered.
[10676] <prose> The impermanent does not need to change through effort, for it has already changed by its very nature.
[10677] <prose> Also, through the reasoning of the three times—past, present, and future—past and future cannot be changed, being non-existent in the present moment. || 130 ||
[10678] <prose> The present has already arisen and immediately ceased, so it cannot be changed.
[10679] <prose> The later part of a moment is not yet born, being non-existent, so there is nothing to change.
[10680] <prose> Because change cannot be perceived in any of the three times, that the ground is changeable in whatever way is not logically valid.
[10681] <tantra> From that very source of reasoning,
[10682] <prose> As was said before by the Teacher regarding what is called changeable:
[10683] <tantra> "If one's own state of the ground is held to be changeable,
[10684] <tantra> This too is no different from being fundamentally undetermined.
[10685] <tantra> Because effect itself reverts to cause without sequence,
[10686] <tantra> Effort becomes unnecessary for those who hold this view.
[10687] <tantra> Because again and again it reverts circularly, || 140 ||
[10688] <tantra> Who could possibly make matter into awareness?
[10689] <tantra> It is not possible by any valid reasoning.
[10690] <tantra> Are not these knowable dharmas apparent upon investigation?
[10691] <tantra> What was said before is just like this demonstration."
[10692] <prose> Thus it is definitively established.
[10693] <prose> The fifth position is also expressed by proponents holding this view:
[10694] <prose> Because awareness, in its essence, has no fixed direction and arises pervasively everywhere, it accepts whatever arises without discrimination.
[10695] <prose> Second, the refutation of that untenable position:
[10696] <prose> Whatever accepts appearances in that manner,
[10697] <prose> Does it accept that it dwells inherently in the ground as the same essence, or || 150 ||
[10698] <prose> Does it accept that it does not dwell in the ground as separate?
