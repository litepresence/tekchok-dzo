[5269] <verse> "Arrive" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.
[5270] <prose> These are like the form of the full moon,
[5271] <prose> The mandala complete through the waxing and waning, without fabrication upon self-essence.
[5272] <prose> Second, the explanation of the three measures in particular has three parts:
[5273] <prose> Outer visions,
[5274] <prose> Inner body measure,
[5275] <prose> Secret awareness measure.
[5276] <prose> The first is controlling the visions and the completion of the realms in luminous clarity.
[5277] <prose> 
[5278] <prose> || 10 ||
[5279] <prose> 
[5280] <prose> 
[5281] <prose> 
[5282] <prose> 
[5283] <prose> 
[5284] <prose> 
[5285] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[5286] <prose> The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[5287] <prose> Direct objective visions cease,
[5288] <prose> The vision of earth and stones melts away, || 20 ||
[5289] <prose> Self-knowing enters into everything,
[5290] <prose> Inert things move when directed,
[5291] <prose> The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[5292] <prose> The body's dust-particles become visible.
[5293] <prose> Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[5294] <tantra> From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[5295] <prose> The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[5296] <prose> All within the round periphery—
[5297] <prose> The yogin's body also luminous,
[5298] <prose> Appearing to go, come, and sit. || 30 ||
[5299] <prose> All is awareness arriving at its measure.
[5300] <ornament> Second:
[5301] <prose> Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A. Five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.
[5302] <prose> Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.
[5303] <tantra> From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.
[5304] <prose> Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.
[5305] <prose> Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms. Measureless Buddhas and beings appear. These are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.
[5306] <prose> In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.
[5307] <prose> In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[5308] <prose> Emanations taming beings, || 40 ||
[5309] <prose> Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.
[5310] <prose> Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and
[5311] <prose> The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.
[5312] <prose> Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakāya.
[5313] <prose> The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[5314] <prose> The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
[5315] <prose> 
[5316] <prose> The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:
[5317] <prose> Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[5318] <prose> The light-star-window of intermediate space appears. || 50 ||
[5319] <prose> Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[5320] <prose> Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.
[5321] <prose> The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[5322] <prose> The transparent stainless light-body.
[5323] <prose> The A mark in the center,
[5324] <prose> And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[5325] <prose> The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.
[5326] <tantra> From the peaceful body's fingers,
[5327] <prose> Light-garlands coil in form.
[5328] <prose> Activity of silent mind, || 60 ||
[5329] <tantra> From the skull palace of the head,
[5330] <prose> Herukas manifestly arise.
[5331] <prose> At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[5332] <prose> The transparent three bodies coil as one.
[5333] <prose> Third, the secret awareness measure:
[5334] <prose> Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[5335] <prose> There exists merely the Kunzhi consciousness mind,
[5336] <prose> Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.
[5337] <tantra> From that itself:
[5338] <prose> At this time the mind is clear, || 70 ||
[5339] <prose> Together with the six clairvoyances,
[5340] <prose> Far and concealed
[5341] <prose> Dharmas become known in a moment.
[5342] <prose> Measureless Buddha-realms and
[5343] <prose> Likewise bodies appear to mind.
[5344] <prose> Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[5345] <prose> Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[5346] <prose> Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[5347] <prose> Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[5348] <prose> Without parts, without elaboration. || 80 ||
[5349] <prose> That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[5350] <prose> At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,
[5351] <prose> Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[5352] <prose> The body-mind connection cut,
[5353] <prose> Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.
[5354] <prose> The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of Kunzhi consciousness,
[5355] <prose> Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
[5356] <prose> 
[5357] <prose> 
[5358] <prose> At the time of the two upper visions, wind is thrown outward and not held inward, || 90 ||
[5359] <prose> Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,
[5360] <prose> The body transparent,
[5361] <prose> The Kunzhi consciousness part clear-vivid like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.
[5362] <prose> Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision, body and mind separate and cut,
[5363] <prose> Accomplishing the great mandala, the supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.
[5364] <prose> Again from the Thal 'gyur:
[5365] <prose> At all times of such vision,
[5366] <prose> The cutting of body-mind connection,
[5367] <tantra> From the contaminated exhausted body also,
[5368] <prose> The mind with clear characteristics arising outward, || 100 ||
[5369] <prose> Like a shooting star emitting,
[5370] <prose> Clearly seen in the realm of space.
[5371] <prose> At the first times of that itself,
[5372] <tantra> From separation from wind also,
[5373] <prose> Through the action of pure wind, effortful,
[5374] <prose> Arising from throwing outward from the body.
[5375] <tantra> From the part of the two see-agents also,
[5376] <prose> The body luminous and pure,
[5377] <prose> The mind like fire-sparks emitting,
[5378] <prose> Not abiding as one, self-clear basis, || 110 ||
[5379] <prose> Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.
[5380] <prose> Through this, having cut body-mind connection,
[5381] <prose> There is no returning to the three realms.
[5382] <prose> At this time, the see-agent also, like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the Kunzhi consciousness part,
[5383] <prose> Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,
[5384] <prose> Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.
[5385] <prose> At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,
[5386] <prose> For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmatā.
[5387] <prose> This is called "completion of practice measure."
[5388] <prose> Fourth, the dharmatā-exhausting vision has two parts: || 120 ||
[5389] <prose> Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and
[5390] <prose> Extensive explanation of nature.
[5391] <ornament> First:
[5392] <tantra> From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,
[5393] <prose> The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,
[5394] <prose> Like the moon waning from that,
[5395] <prose> Again that body fading until reaching the bindu, certain vision to the first mind.
[5396] <prose> That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions through the fourfold sequence of container-contents' arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.
[5397] <prose> 
[5398] <prose> Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death— || 130 ||
[5399] <prose> The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and
[5400] <prose> The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and
[5401] <prose> Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.
[5402] <prose> If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.
[5403] <prose> Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,
[5404] <prose> Support-ground not existing,
[5405] <prose> The vital point of no ground of return.
[5406] <prose> Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,
[5407] <prose> Now awareness itself is separate from death.
[5408] <prose> Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment, || 140 ||
[5409] <prose> Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"
[5410] <prose> Therefore called "dharmatā exhaustion"—the meaningful result.
[5411] <prose> The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable.
[5412] <prose> Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the Kunzhi consciousness mind exhausted,
[5413] <prose> And purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmatā of the three doors of the Kunzhi part.
[5414] <prose> Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,
[5415] <prose> That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmatā,
[5416] <prose> Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmatā exhaustion."
[5417] <prose> Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going,
[5418] <prose> The primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"— || 150 ||
[5419] <prose> Not like vision as entity and characteristic.
[5420] <prose> At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmatā exhaustion.
[5421] <prose> The dharma-possessor object and
[5422] <prose> The dharmatā's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor,
[5423] <prose> The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with Kunzhi.
[5424] <prose> The manner of exhaustion:
[5425] <prose> Gradual and
[5426] <prose> Instantaneous, from the two.
[5427] <prose> Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.
[5428] <prose> Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmatā manifestly at first. || 160 ||
[5429] <prose> There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—
[5430] <prose> This is called "supreme instantaneous mind."
[5431] <prose> Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru, greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—such an exhaustion manner merely exists.
[5432] <prose> Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:
[5433] <prose> Essence,
[5434] <break> <prose> Definition,
[5435] <break> <prose> Nature,
[5436] <break> <prose> dharmatā,
[5437] <break> <prose> Boundary.
[5438] <prose> The essence of dharmatā exhaustion: || 170 ||
[5439] <prose> Outer lights-five vision, together with bodies, exhausted;
[5440] <prose> Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted;
[5441] <prose> Experience vision objects exhausted,
[5442] <prose> Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially pure vision.
[5443] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[5444] <prose> The vision of dharmatā exhaustion—
[5445] <prose> Experience vision emptying,
[5446] <prose> Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,
[5447] <prose> Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,
[5448] <prose> Separate from words of expressive basis. || 180 ||
[5449] <prose> Definition:
[5450] <verse> "Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates, together with afflictions.
[5451] <verse> "Itself" is together with the part of meditating the luminosity vision of the purifying path.
[5452] <verse> "Exhaust" is "empty,"
[5453] <prose> Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—
[5454] <prose> Called "non-observation."
[5455] <tantra> From that itself:
[5456] <prose> Thus the certain definition of dharmatā—
[5457] <break> <prose> To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,
[5458] <break> <prose> Doing actions and holding characteristics, || 190 ||
[5459] <prose> Making self-vision empty,
[5460] <prose> Holding individual families.
[5461] <verse> "Itself" is to the unfabricated,
[5462] <prose> Pervading the real through natural abiding,
[5463] <prose> To the unfabricated, original, continuous,
[5464] <prose> Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.
[5465] <prose> Nature:
[5466] <prose> Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted, activity merely upon primordially pure self-resonance like the resonance of blue-grey sky.
[5467] <tantra> From the Rtsal rdzogs:
[5468] <prose> At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion— || 200 ||
[5469] <prose> Like the sky, free from action.
[5470] <prose> dharmatā has two parts:
[5471] <prose> The dharmatā of vision:
[5472] <prose> Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.
[5473] <prose> Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.
[5474] <prose> 
[5475] <prose> 
[5476] <prose> 
[5477] <prose> Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmatā,
[5478] <prose> Controlling the great eye and clairvoyance, obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms. || 210 ||
[5479] <prose> Thus, the Kunzhi subtle knowable obscurations very cut—except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations.
[5480] <prose> This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion."
[5481] <prose> Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations, entering the primordially pure Dharmakāya of the inner expanse, the very peace.
[5482] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[5483] <prose> The dharmatā of self-Buddha cessation:
[5484] <break> <prose> Elements ceasing, dust ceases,
[5485] <break> <prose> Dust and particles ultimately cease,
[5486] <prose> Not even a mere part abides.
[5487] <prose> Afflictions ceasing, delusion and
[5488] <prose> Concept-free attachment not abiding, || 220 ||
[5489] <prose> Latencies and all-arising
[5490] <prose> Not even dust-parts abide.
[5491] <prose> Thus through subtle and coarse cessation,
[5492] <prose> The five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end,
[5493] <prose> The body of four elements exhausted,
[5494] <prose> All is wisdom, Sambhogakāya.
[5495] <prose> Concept-free samadhi self-abiding,
[5496] <prose> Having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication,
[5497] <verse> "Dharma" does not abide in words.
[5498] <prose> The empty dharmatā: || 230 ||
[5499] <prose> Through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds, mind and mental-events exhaust.
[5500] <prose> The vision aspect of body and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon, also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially pure vision,
[5501] <prose> This is expressed as "the Dharmakāya vision, the core result dharmatā, self-vision."
[5502] <prose> Again from the previous:
[5503] <prose> The dharmatā of cause and result:
[5504] <prose> Coarse conceptuality source ceasing,
[5505] <prose> Memory self-pure from the continuum also,
[5506] <prose> Dependent-arising wind itself fully pure,
[5507] <prose> The dharmatā arising from cause.
[5508] <prose> To the primordially pure nature, || 240 ||
[5509] <prose> The numbers of one and many exhaust,
[5510] <prose> Body and wisdom non-existent,
[5511] <prose> Arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—
[5512] <prose> Considered to be the result dharmatā.
[5513] <ornament> Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.
[5514] <prose> 
[5515] <prose> 
[5516] <prose> Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—
[5517] <prose> That is a great error.
[5518] <prose> They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward. || 250 ||
[5519] <prose> If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;
[5520] <prose> Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future;
[5521] <prose> It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the basis of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse;
[5522] <prose> It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number.
[5523] <prose> Such faults are not suitable to accept.
[5524] <prose> Fifth, the boundary:
[5525] <prose> At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,
[5526] <prose> The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and
[5527] <prose> The boundary of inward return to outer vision.
[5528] <prose> Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time, || 260 ||
[5529] <prose> Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,
[5530] <prose> Outer visions and
[5531] <prose> The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,
[5532] <tantra> From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,
[5533] <prose> Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,
[5534] <prose> The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,
[5535] <prose> Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel,
[5536] <prose> Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,
[5537] <prose> Awareness Buddha-fied into Dharmakāya, coiled.
[5538] <prose> If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action, || 270 ||
[5539] <prose> Moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.
[5540] <prose> This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection,
[5541] <prose> And that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through transparent, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—
[5542] <prose> Called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings."
[5543] <prose> Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the transparent—
[5544] <prose> Like the great master Vimala and
[5545] <prose> Padma.
[5546] <prose> Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,
[5547] <prose> Although Buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,
[5548] <prose> Yet doing the benefit of beings until saṃsāra is not empty, possessing self-power. || 280 ||
[5549] <prose> Control over birth:
[5550] <prose> At the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously,
[5551] <prose> Even insects cease into light.
[5552] <prose> Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.
[5553] <prose> Control over entry:
[5554] <prose> Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,
[5555] <prose> Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings,
[5556] <prose> Making rain of food and clothes.
[5557] <prose> Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,
[5558] <prose> If not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse; || 290 ||
[5559] <prose> If doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free,
[5560] <prose> Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields.
[5561] <prose> Through earth treasures,
[5562] <prose> Jewels,
[5563] <prose> Dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means,
[5564] <prose> For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.
[5565] <prose> Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.
[5566] <tantra> This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:
[5567] <prose> When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[5568] <prose> Fingers and so forth appear thus. || 300 ||
[5569] <prose> Focusing this, elements naturally cease.
[5570] <prose> Through the difference of birth and entry,
[5571] <prose> Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[5572] <prose> Without holding anything whatsoever,
[5573] <prose> One abides—this is the emanation body.
[5574] <prose> Through this, the power of entry's force,
[5575] <prose> Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[5576] <prose> Also focusing upon that,
[5577] <prose> Again at times doing thus,
[5578] <prose> The self-sound of vision rustling, || 310 ||
[5579] <prose> Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.
[5580] <prose> Through this, doing all benefit for beings,
[5581] <prose> For awareness is equal and one,
[5582] <prose> The great transfer of three thousand
[5583] <prose> Beings is accomplished by this.
[5584] <prose> Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[5585] <prose> The body is accomplished by this.
[5586] <prose> All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.
[5587] <prose> All this, certain result,
[5588] <prose> Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground. || 320 ||
[5589] <prose> Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[5590] <prose> Like the rungs of a ladder.
[5591] <prose> That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease;
[5592] <tantra> From the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished.
[5593] <prose> Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, Buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself,
[5594] <prose> Especially sublime from the common vehicles,
[5595] <prose> Having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.
[5596] <prose> Upon that itself:
[5597] <prose> For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood,
[5598] <prose> If possessing this means, it is thus. || 330 ||
[5599] <prose> For other conduct is pride itself,
[5600] <prose> Not seeing entity.
[5601] <prose> Therefore this is all rare words—
[5602] <break> <prose> Always look to this jewel treasure.
[5603] <break> <prose> Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.
[5604] <prose> 
[5605] <prose> 
[5606] <prose> That also: establishing basis through three unmoving in speech,
[5607] <prose> Holding measure through three vows,
