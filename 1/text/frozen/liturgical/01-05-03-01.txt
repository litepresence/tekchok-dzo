[4698] <prose> The Reason for Establishing Eight Sections: || 60 ||
[4699] <tantra> If the two root tantras are lacking:
[4700] <prose> Like a trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise.
[4701] <tantra> If the two explanatory mother and child tantras are lacking:
[4702] <prose> Like no leaves from that—no flowers arise.
[4703] <tantra> If the two limb tantras are lacking:
[4704] <prose> Like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls.
[4705] <tantra> If the two entering-self-liberation tantras are lacking:
[4706] <prose> Like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others.
[4707] <tantra> If the two scripture-logic clear tantras are lacking:
[4708] <list> Like no flowers on the stem—results do not arise. || 70 ||
[4709] <list> Like no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time—like so.
[4710] <tantra> If the four upadesha tantras are lacking:
[4711] <prose> If no results, agriculture is meaningless—like so.
[4712] <tantra> If the three intention-self-abiding tantras are lacking:
[4713] <prose> Like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city.
[4714] <tantra> If the expert ritual Tantra is lacking:
[4715] <prose> Like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves.
[4716] <prose> Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete.
[4717] <prose> If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight.
[4718] <prose> If more than that: not needed. || 80 ||
[4719] <prose> The Name and Meaning of the Eight Sections Explained:
[4720] <prose> Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into rigpa.
[4721] <prose> Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings.

[4740] <tantra> Inexpressible awareness-meaning arises in Tantra.

[4752] <prose> Faculty clear—distinguishes dharma and non-dharma.
[4753] <prose> Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble.
[4754] <prose> Holding those—transcend the three realms.
[4755] <prose> Entering emptiness, entering appearances—appearance-mind mouth-joined.
[4756] <prose> Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual.
[4757] <prose> Self-liberated—uncontrived.
[4758] <prose> Expert: || 120 ||
[4759] <prose> Expert in time and crucial points: merely thinking accomplishes destruction.
