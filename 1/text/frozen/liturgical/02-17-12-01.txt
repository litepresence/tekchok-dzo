[3600] <prose> First, the seven verbal views held by individual intellectual analysis:
[3601] <prose> The view of action-free primordial liberation,
[3602] <prose> The view of effort-free primordial liberation,
[3603] <prose> The view distinguished as progressive stages of mind leading upward,
[3604] <prose> The view transcending virtue and vice,
[3605] <prose> The view of great non-doing and non-arising,
[3606] <prose> The view of great unmodified self-purity, and
[3607] <prose> The view of great self-arisen self-liberation—these seven.
[3608] <prose> The view of meaning is the view of vidya in its own immediacy.
[3609] <prose> Regarding this:
[3610] <tantra> From the same source:
[3611] <verse> Regarding that, views are of two types:
[3612] <verse> Verbal view and view of meaning.
[3613] <verse> From the sequence of seven verbal views,
[3614] <verse> Individual mental preferences are made:
[3615] <verse> Action-free, without effort,
[3616] <verse> Progressive distinction of self and other,
[3617] <verse> Free from killing, virtue and vice,
[3618] <verse> Without doing, without ground of arising,
[3619] <verse> Unmodified, appearances self-pure,
[3620] <verse> Afflictions self-placed, liberated.
[3621] <verse> Meaning is the direct dharmatā,
[3622] <verse> Not by prajñā,
[3623] <verse> Viewed as the very domain of sense-powers.
[3624] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3625] <prose> Verbal views are the summary of general mind-vast Great Perfection views.
[3626] <prose> Second, the enumerated views are the nine individual progressive views.
[3627] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3628] <prose> Enumerations of expressed words and names:
[3629] <prose> Outer, inner, secret,
[3630] <verse> And unsurpassed view—these four.
[3631] <verse> Outer is view of phenomena,
[3632] <verse> Eight progressive mental preferences,
[3633] <verse> Held as intellectual apprehension.
[3634] <verse> Viewing inner dharmatā,
[3635] <verse> Essence and nature seen as illusory.
[3636] <verse> Viewing secret self-awareness,
[3637] <break> <verse> Seeing linked-chain connection.
[3638] <break> <verse> Suchness goes to expanse-vidya.
[3639] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3640] <prose> Third, regarding the view of nature: the view of abiding is that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are primordially liberated;
[3641] <prose> The view of pure-seeing transcends cause, effect, action, and effort;
[3642] <prose> The view of nature is that appearance-existence is primordially liberated appearance;
[3643] <prose> The view without fabrication is the great vastness of liberation from extremes.
[3644] <prose> Regarding this:
[3645] <verse> Moreover, dharmatā wheel is explained.
[3646] <verse> The view of abiding realizes all dharmas,
[3647] <verse> Nature pure, dividing saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3648] <verse> Without doing, losing arising.
[3649] <verse> Authentic path pervaded by emptiness,
[3650] <verse> Great emptiness of complete arising,
[3651] <verse> Complete without action, without arising,
[3652] <verse> Saṃsāra pure, transcended.
[3653] <verse> Moreover, the view of pure-seeing:
[3654] <verse> Phenomena non-existent, great self-pure completeness,
[3655] <verse> No need for deity worship,
[3656] <verse> No mantra recitation, no austerity,
[3657] <verse> What are incense, lamps, deity offerings?
[3658] <verse> No accumulation, no torma offering,
[3659] <verse> No giving, no fire offering, no worshipper.
[3660] <verse> Six pāramitās without extremes,
[3661] <verse> Thus no ground-root whatsoever.
[3662] <verse> Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct,
[3663] <verse> Without view, without meditation, without conduct.
[3664] <verse> Without seeing, without examination—what is meditation desire?
[3665] <verse> What is mind's desire for emptiness and clarity?
[3666] <verse> Likewise, dharmas and Buddha are without dharmas.
[3667] <prose> Moreover, explaining the view of nature:
[3668] <verse> Earth, water, fire, wind elements manifest Buddha,
[3669] <verse> Unfabricated, great self-liberation itself.
[3670] <verse> Desire, hatred, delusion are the ground of enlightenment,
[3671] <verse> Confidence in realizing thought-action conduct.
[3672] <verse> Saṃsāra not abandoned is Buddha's intention,
[3673] <verse> Body, speech, and mind complete the three bodies.
[3674] <verse> Mind and ignorance-delusion are dharmatā-ground,
[3675] <verse> Action imprints and fixation clinging are view-essence.
[3676] <prose> Moreover, the view without fabrication:
[3677] <verse> Buddha who has not arisen from dharmas,
[3678] <verse> Fruition complete, not produced by causes,
[3679] <verse> Taking body, not destroyed by conditions.
[3680] <verse> Six extremes not arisen from scriptures,
[3681] <verse> Not relying on tantras, by oral instructions,
[3682] <verse> Cutting the root of nirvāṇa,
[3683] <verse> Ripening the fruition of saṃsāra.
[3684] <verse> Unauthentic, impure ground,
[3685] <verse> Six afflictions without ground,
[3686] <verse> Emptying the seed of enlightenment,
[3687] <verse> Ripening the forms of three lower realms,
[3688] <verse> The three bodies also hand-taken.
[3689] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3690] <prose> Finally, this is the view of self-knowing spontaneous Great Perfection,
[3691] <prose> Definitively establishing the view of the nature of liberation-delusion duality.
[3692] <prose> It is renowned as the view of expression-objects.
[3693] <prose> Third, the ground-juncture:
[3694] <prose> The general ground-juncture of view connects to one's own realization, entering the expanse in due time,
[3695] <prose> Particularly, at the time of the word-meaning view ground-juncture, through intellectual analysis,
[3696] <prose> Transcending that, distinguished.
[3697] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3698] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3699] <prose> The ground-juncture of word-meaning view:
[3700] <prose> Words are the cause of expression.
[3701] <verse> That which expresses and emanates,
[3702] <verse> From that, intellect contemplates.
[3703] <verse> Three pure direct measures,
[3704] <verse> Engaging linked-chain directly.
[3705] <verse> Thus it is said.
[3706] <prose> Second, recognizing one's own view:
[3707] <prose> The view of Great Perfection action-free spontaneous perfection,
[3708] <prose> Divided, there are three.
