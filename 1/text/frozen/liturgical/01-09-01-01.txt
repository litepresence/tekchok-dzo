[11335] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[11336] <tantra> "These are the nature of primordial purity," it is said,
[11337] <tantra> Not falling into any direction of India or Tibet.
[11338] <tantra> Thereafter exists the Precious Jewel Casket of Spontaneous Presence,
[11339] <tantra> In which there are eight modes of appearance.
[11340] <tantra> There are two gates. || 11340 ||
[11341] <tantra> This is called the Ground of Spontaneous Presence.
[11342] <tantra> It is called the Ground of Indeterminacy.
[11343] <tantra> It is also called the Ground Appearing as Diversity.
[11344] <tantra> Below this lies the point of reversal.
[11345] <tantra> Thereafter exists the Great Ground-Appearance.
[11346] <tantra> Thereafter exists the Sambhogakāya appearance, it is taught.
[11347] <prose> Therefore, when explaining these meanings here in detail,
[11348] <prose> The essence abiding as form within the youthful vase body of the primordial expanse,
[11349] <prose> The nature abiding as speech,
[11350] <prose> The compassion abiding as mind. || 11350 ||
[11351] <prose> Moreover, from the outward projection of the tones of rigpa abiding as the quintessence in the five wisdom winds with the four limbs of the life-wind,
[11352] <tantra> From the tones of spontaneous presence in the expanding expanse of the youthful vase body, the appearances of five lights arise as fiery sparks.
[11353] <prose> At the same time, the investigating consciousness arises toward the tones of rigpa-compassion,
[11354] <tantra> From the mere aspect of not knowing its own face, it abides as non-recognition dependent upon rigpa.
[11355] <prose> Consequently, although the ground itself does not change, because of the appearance of ground-appearance arising, it seems as though it changes.
[11356] <prose> This is called the change of appearance in rigpa.
[11357] <prose> At that time, from the state of primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,
[11358] <prose> The eight modes of spontaneous presence arise as self-appearance.
[11359] <prose> The great manner of appearance of the precious casket jewel is:
[11360] <prose> The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed gives rise to compassion for sentient beings. || 11360 ||
[11361] <prose> The gate of light appearing unobstructed fills appearances with the self-light of the five wisdoms, like a rainbow.
[11362] <prose> The gate of wisdom appearing unobstructed abides in the state of non-conceptuality.
[11363] <prose> The gate of form appearing unobstructed fills space with the clear light bodies of peaceful and wrathful deities.
[11364] <prose> The gate of non-duality appearing unobstructed does not conceive of singular or plural.
[11365] <prose> The gate of beyond-extremes appearing unobstructed makes spontaneous presence naturally clear in its own state.
[11366] <prose> The gate of pure wisdom appearing unobstructed reveals appearances above like a cloudless sky, the primordially pure appearance.
[11367] <prose> The gate of impure saṃsāra appearing unobstructed reveals the appearances of the six realms below.
[11368] <prose> Thus saṃsāra and the lower realms manifest in spontaneous presence.
[11369] <prose> This is the manner of it.
[11370] <prose> Thus, in this way, from the power of spontaneous presence appearance, within the five wisdom fields, Sambhogakāya appearances are directly self-clear. || 11370 ||
[11371] <tantra> From the power of qualities in the directions, Natural Nirmāṇakāya fields appear self-arisen, immeasurable.
[11372] <tantra> From the power of compassion below, sentient beings appear immeasurably, self-appearing.
[11373] <prose> Such ground-appearance clarity, though manifestly appearing, is like reflections in a mirror.
[11374] <prose> Appearing to oneself, not appearing to others, not recognized as self-appearance, like dream appearances,
[11375] <prose> Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant,
[11376] <prose> Not grasping its own face, but for a single moment.
[11377] <prose> This too is the spontaneous presence appearance within primordial purity.
[11378] <prose> Thereafter exists the great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays.
[11379] <prose> Thereafter exists the Sambhogakāya appearance.
[11380] <prose> Thereafter exists the Natural Nirmāṇakāya appearance. || 11380 ||
[11381] <prose> Thereafter exists the appearance of the six realms.
[11382] <prose> The six Subduers, Nirmanakayas subduing beings,
[11383] <prose> And the impure Nirmāṇakāya fields that tame through birth, aging, sickness, and death.
[11384] <prose> These eight modes of spontaneous presence are the source from which all these arise.
[11385] <prose> Like a container for roasting barley.
[11386] <prose> Therefore this is called the casket.
[11387] <tantra> These also, from the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra:
[11388] <tantra> "Alas, though there is no error, from my power error arises,
[11389] <tantra> From the unchanging ground,
[11390] <tantra> Appearing without ceasing in its nature, || 11390 ||
[11391] <tantra> From compassion's indeterminacy, non-recognition self-arises.
[11392] <tantra> For example, just as clouds do not truly exist in the sky but arise adventitiously,
[11393] <tantra> So ground, path, and rigpa do not exist as such,
[11394] <tantra> Yet from appearing like compassion, non-recognition arises.
[11395] <tantra> The nature of spontaneous presence is established."
[11396] <prose> This too abides as great indeterminate appearance.
[11397] <prose> This possesses eight modes of appearance.
[11398] <prose> It is called the Precious Jewel Casket nature.
[11399] <prose> The gate of sense pleasures unobstructed.
[11400] <prose> Abiding as the great unestablished establishment. || 11400 ||
[11401] <prose> The gate of compassion appearing unobstructed.
[11402] <prose> The enjoyment of wisdom appearing unobstructed.
[11403] <prose> The essence appearing unobstructed as form.
[11404] <prose> The view indeterminate, appearing as non-dual.
[11405] <prose> The method unobstructed, appearing as beyond-extremes.
[11406] <prose> The pure wisdom gate fully passed through.
[11407] <prose> The compassion unobstructed, appearing as impure.
[11408] <prose> Like a wish-fulfilling jewel,
[11409] <prose> Such abides in my body.
[11410] <prose> The inner youthful vase body, wide and expansive, || 11410 ||
[11411] <prose> The outer abides as the nature of spontaneous presence.
[11412] <prose> At that time, my appearance expands outward,
[11413] <prose> Undefined and indefinite,
[11414] <prose> Fragmented and scattered,
[11415] <prose> Unmeasured and untamed,
[11416] <prose> Unwavering and undistracted,
[11417] <prose> Moving,
[11418] <prose> Shifting,
[11419] <prose> Arising diversely.
[11420] <prose> Thereafter the great nature of spontaneous presence is established. || 11420 ||
[11421] <tantra> From the unobstructed gate of wisdom, the manner of Sambhogakāya appearance is established.
[11422] <tantra> From the unobstructed gate of qualities, the manner of Natural Nirmāṇakāya appearance exists.
[11423] <tantra> From that unobstructed compassion, the impure manner of appearance arises.
[11424] <prose> Such appearance is the great dharma beyond measure and conception.
[11425] <prose> All lights and forms are magnificently arrayed in spontaneous presence.
[11426] <prose> The broad gate of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arising.
[11427] <prose> The great casket that encompasses all.
[11428] <tantra> From the Garland of Pearls:
[11429] <tantra> "Radiance manifestly appears, majestically great,
[11430] <break> <tantra> Appearance itself is spontaneously beautiful, || 11430 ||
[11431] <break> <tantra> The Dharmakāya is introduced and delighted,
[11432] <tantra> The essence is pristine, the casket vast,
[11433] <tantra> The nature all-pervasive, magnificently expansive,
[11434] <tantra> The compassion all-arising, magnificently productive,
[11435] <tantra> The pervasion is the original tone, splendidly clear,
[11436] <tantra> The abiding is unobstructed, swiftly flowing,
[11437] <tantra> The self-snow of rigpa, luminously clear,
[11438] <tantra> The emptiness all-arising, face wondrous,
[11439] <tantra> Unsought, self-settled, continuously enduring,
[11440] <tantra> Unobstructed, self-arising, magnificently established, || 11440 ||
[11441] <tantra> The appearances of saṃsāra and existence, foundation towering,
[11442] <tantra> Effortless self-liberation, greatly expansive,
[11443] <tantra> Great primordial realization, skillfully circling,
[11444] <tantra> Possessing five colors, beautifully inscribed,
[11445] <tantra> saṃsāra and existence utterly pure, perfectly even,
[11446] <tantra> Self-arisen clear light, beautifully arrayed,
[11447] <tantra> The great ground-appearance, greatly encompassing,
[11448] <tantra> The two, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, skillfully related,
[11449] <tantra> The five bodies and five wisdoms, beautifully stacked."
[11450] <tantra> Thus it is. || 11450 ||
[11451] <tantra> From such appearance,
[11452] <prose> When the eight modes of spontaneous presence are explained in detail,
[11453] <tantra> From the Precious Heap Tantra:
[11454] <tantra> "Alas, Teacher Samantabhadra,
[11455] <tantra> What is the manner of the ground appearing?
[11456] <tantra> How many gates of qualities appear?
[11457] <tantra> From emptiness, how do
[11458] <tantra> Qualities appear complete? Please teach me."
[11459] <tantra> Then he spoke thus:
[11460] <tantra> "From the miracle of non-arising, || 11460 ||
[11461] <tantra> In the activity of the Buddhas,
[11462] <tantra> From the beginning, without discerning,
[11463] <tantra> Without ceasing, without termination,
[11464] <tantra> Appearance itself is primordially pure,
[11465] <tantra> Abiding in its own face.
[11466] <tantra> From the great unceasing compassion,
[11467] <tantra> Spontaneous presence, indeterminate,
[11468] <tantra> Arises in the manner of eight appearances.
[11469] <tantra> Through the unobstructed manner of appearance,
[11470] <tantra> From the manner of appearance like compassion, || 11470 ||
[11471] <tantra> The source of protection for all sentient beings.
[11472] <tantra> From self-clear unobstructed appearance,
[11473] <tantra> Appears in the manner of the five lights' arising.
[11474] <tantra> Through the unobstructed appearance of knowledge,
[11475] <tantra> Into the gate of pure wisdom,
[11476] <tantra> Appearance arises unobstructed, like the path.
[11477] <tantra> Since all bodies are complete in self-appearance,
[11478] <tantra> They appear as the body of all dharmas.
[11479] <tantra> Since the essence is one,
[11480] <tantra> It also appears as non-dual. || 11480 ||
[11481] <tantra> Since it does not abide in its own place,
[11482] <tantra> In the great appearance beyond-extremes,
[11483] <tantra> The indeterminate spontaneous presence appears in the ground.
[11484] <tantra> Since rigpa is spontaneously complete in one,
[11485] <tantra> Into the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11486] <tantra> Related to the essence itself.
[11487] <tantra> Since the manner of arising is unobstructed,
[11488] <tantra> As the source of arising for all sentient beings,
[11489] <tantra> Like the gate of impure appearance,
[11490] <tantra> Arising from the aspect of pervading appearance, || 11490 ||
[11491] <tantra> All this appears as the eight appearances.
[11492] <tantra> Since it self-arises in the manner of arising,
[11493] <tantra> It is called the appearance of spontaneous presence.
[11494] <tantra> Appearing in the manner of the precious jewel.
[11495] <tantra> Thus from the great empty-clear,
[11496] <tantra> The manner of appearing as anything from nothing,
[11497] <tantra> The manner of qualities unobstructed,
[11498] <tantra> The unobstructed appearance of spontaneous presence,
[11499] <tantra> As the nature of various appearances,
[11500] <tantra> Appears as great qualities. || 11500 ||
[11501] <tantra> From the eight gates of appearance,
[11502] <tantra> Appear in the manner of eight qualities."
[11503] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11504] <prose> In the place of the appearance of the eight outward-projecting modes of spontaneous presence, it is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of Ground-Appearance.
[11505] <prose> The complete primordial ground,
[11506] <prose> The ground and the ground of spontaneous presence of natural sleep, the Precious Casket,
[11507] <prose> The complete fruition, the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of Secret Casket,
[11508] <prose> These are explained as the three caskets of spontaneous presence.
[11509] <prose> The ground appearing is called the Precious Casket of Spontaneous Presence of the Path.
[11510] <prose> Thus, when taking into experience, all the wisdoms of the four appearances and all path appearances arise from this. || 11510 ||
[11511] <tantra> From the eight gates of spontaneous presence appearance, all dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arise with unobstructed gates,
[11512] <prose> Particularly, from the self-light of form and wisdom, the ground Sambhogakāya appearance of clear light pure elements appears as original presence.
[11513] <prose> The warm aspect of the wisdom fire,
[11514] <prose> The cool water of compassion gathering,
[11515] <prose> The light earth abiding in the expanse,
[11516] <prose> The moving aspect of the fivefold self-power wind abiding, the appearance of the mandala.
[11517] <tantra> From the tones or power of that appearance, Natural Nirmāṇakāya fields are adorned with immeasurable richness.
[11518] <tantra> From those tones, Nirmanakayas subduing beings work for the benefit of the appearance of wandering beings.
[11519] <prose> The impure Nirmāṇakāya appearance increases and is established.
[11520] <prose> Though these were shown above, || 11520 ||
[11521] <prose> Because they were explained extensively,
[11522] <prose> For the sake of easy understanding, they are further explained.
[11523] <tantra> From the Auspicious Beautiful:
[11524] <tantra> "From that arises the manner of appearance of the Precious Spontaneous Presence.
[11525] <tantra> This is called the ground from which all dharmas arise for the Buddha.
[11526] <tantra> From that the Buddha arises.
[11527] <tantra> Sentient beings arise.
[11528] <tantra> Wisdom arises.
[11529] <tantra> Light arises.
[11530] <tantra> Rigpa arises. || 11530 ||
[11531] <tantra> Non-recognition arises.
[11532] <tantra> All karma arises.
[11533] <tantra> Compassion arises.
[11534] <tantra> Appearances as existence arise.
[11535] <tantra> This is the essence.
[11536] <tantra> The nature appears as such.
[11537] <tantra> Compassion appears as such.
[11538] <tantra> Power exists.
[11539] <tantra> Appearance exists.
[11540] <tantra> Mind exists. || 11540 ||
[11541] <tantra> Mentality exists.
[11542] <tantra> Error exists.
[11543] <tantra> Non-error also exists.
[11544] <tantra> The great arising of all.
[11545] <tantra> This is called the great expanse of Buddhas and sentient beings.
[11546] <tantra> From that arises the manner of Sambhogakāya appearance.
[11547] <tantra> This is called the ground of manifest path appearance.
[11548] <tantra> This is luminous,
[11549] <tantra> Warm,
[11550] <tantra> Cool, || 11550 ||
[11551] <tantra> Light,
[11552] <tantra> Possessing the nature of the moving,
[11553] <tantra> Possessing the five bodies,
[11554] <tantra> Possessing the five wisdoms,
[11555] <tantra> The five families,
[11556] <tantra> The five colors,
[11557] <tantra> The five lights,
[11558] <tantra> The five fathers,
[11559] <tantra> The five mothers,
[11560] <tantra> The five forms, || 11560 ||
[11561] <tantra> The five sounds,
[11562] <tantra> The five smells,
[11563] <tantra> The five tastes,
[11564] <tantra> The five touches,
[11565] <tantra> The five dharmas,
[11566] <tantra> The five appearances,
[11567] <tantra> The five principal ones,
[11568] <tantra> Possessing the five retinues."
[11569] <tantra> These possess the thirty-two major marks.
[11570] <tantra> Possessing the eighty minor marks. || 11570 ||
[11571] <tantra> Possessing the six broad dharmas.
[11572] <tantra> This is the manner of Sambhogakāya appearance,
[11573] <tantra> The connection arising from that and that.
[11574] <tantra> From that appearance, the appearance of Natural Nirmāṇakāya,
[11575] <tantra> The manner of Nirmāṇakāya appearance subduing beings,
[11576] <tantra> The manner of impure Nirmāṇakāya appearance is established.
[11577] <tantra> The Natural Nirmāṇakāya body itself
[11578] <tantra> Arises from spontaneous presence.
[11579] <tantra> The manner of appearance of that Natural Nirmāṇakāya body is:
[11580] <tantra> Enjoyment inexhaustible, || 11580 ||
[11581] <tantra> Retinue inexhaustible,
[11582] <tantra> Qualities unknowable,
[11583] <tantra> Power unknowable,
[11584] <tantra> Power unknowable,
[11585] <tantra> Miracles unknowable,
[11586] <tantra> Lifespan immeasurable,
[11587] <tantra> Free from all suffering of illness,
[11588] <tantra> The palace inconceivable,
[11589] <tantra> Teaching dharmas inconceivable."
[11590] <tantra> This is called the manner of Natural Nirmāṇakāya appearance. || 11590 ||
[11591] <tantra> From that arises the Nirmāṇakāya subduing beings.
[11592] <tantra> That appears as diversity, knowing the meaning of diversity,
[11593] <tantra> Though appearing, not interrupted,
[11594] <tantra> Not attached to appearance,
[11595] <tantra> Possessing pure eyes,
[11596] <tantra> Possessing pure ears,
[11597] <tantra> Possessing pure nose,
[11598] <tantra> Possessing pure tongue,
[11599] <tantra> Possessing pure body,
[11600] <tantra> Possessing pure mind, || 11600 ||
[11601] <tantra> Showing various compassionate activities,
[11602] <tantra> Possessing special wisdom,
[11603] <tantra> Appearing everywhere with unobstructed knowledge."
[11604] <tantra> This is the Nirmāṇakāya subduing beings.
[11605] <tantra> From that arises the impure world-system.
[11606] <tantra> This appears in the following manner as the great appearance:
[11607] <tantra> From the arising of the outer container of the five elements' mandala,
[11608] <tantra> Earth,
[11609] <tantra> Water,
[11610] <tantra> Fire, || 11610 ||
[11611] <tantra> Wind,
[11612] <tantra> The great element space exists."
[11613] <tantra> From that, the mind of the holder cannot be expressed in words,
[11614] <tantra> Desire,
[11615] <tantra> Anger,
[11616] <tantra> Delusion,
[11617] <tantra> Pride,
[11618] <tantra> Jealousy,
[11619] <break> <tantra> And hatred—the six."
[11620] <break> <tantra> From that arise the six classes of beings." || 11620 ||
[11621] <tantra> From jealousy, humans are established."
[11622] <tantra> From hatred, gods are established."
[11623] <tantra> From pride, demigods are established."
[11624] <tantra> From desire, hungry ghosts are established."
[11625] <tantra> From delusion, animals are established."
[11626] <tantra> From black anger, hell beings are established."
[11627] <tantra> Thus the appearances of the six classes are established."
[11628] <tantra> This is the place of saṃsāra."
[11629] <tantra> This too arises from the one great nature in four manners of appearance."
[11630] <tantra> From the four natures, four manners of appearance arise." || 11630 ||
[11631] <tantra> The four great appearances are:
[11632] <tantra> Spontaneous presence appearing as diversity."
[11633] <tantra> Sambhogakāya abiding as the illusory nature of light with eyes and ears."
[11634] <tantra> Nirmāṇakāya appearing as form."
[11635] <tantra> Sentient beings appearing as different though appearing."
[11636] <tantra> This too is called the obscuration of the manner of appearance for sentient beings."
[11637] <tantra> When all this is condensed,
[11638] <tantra> Below the primordially pure appearance like a cloudless sky,
[11639] <tantra> From the eight modes of spontaneous presence gate, the wisdom appearance Sambhogakāya,
[11640] <tantra> From that power directly, immeasurable appearances of the five families, || 11640 ||
[11641] <tantra> The Natural Nirmāṇakāya appears,
[11642] <tantra> Below showing the realms of the six migrations with their tamer.
[11643] <tantra> The three body appearances arising as three tiers is the appearance of the Ground of Spontaneous Presence."
[11644] <tantra> The Sambhogakāya appearing to oneself, the Buddhas of the Natural Nirmanakayas subduing beings, are the power of one's own ground-appearance."
[11645] <tantra> They do not exist now in any particular direction,
[11646] <tantra> Because they are appearances of self-rigpa, they abide together with self-rigpa."
[11647] <tantra> The appearance of the six migrations of self-appearance also does not exist elsewhere, but self-arises from the unobstructed manner of appearance like the gate of impure saṃsāra."
[11648] <tantra> Thus, though this appearance exists for each individually,
[11649] <tantra> The common aspect of the common world is through common karma,
[11650] <tantra> Arranged by the Teacher's activity." || 11650 ||
[11651] <tantra> The aspect appearing as error to oneself, though appearing, is arranged by the gate of self-appearance saṃsāra."
[11652] <tantra> The aspect of self-appearance goes to self-reversal when the casket shifts."
[11653] <tantra> The common remains elsewhere, still wandering."
[11654] <tantra> Distinguishing these two is extremely important."
[11655] <prose> Hence, <tantra> Naturally, from the gate of self-arisen spontaneous presence in rigpa, the appearance of the six migrations exists."
[11656] <tantra> The key point is that the deluded appearance, dream-like, must be sent to self-reversal in the ground of primordial purity without appearance."
[11657] <tantra> In the bardo too, the six migrations of one's own face, whether the Nirmanakayas of self-appearance work for benefit or not, are explained as two aspects."
[11658] <tantra> Before the gate of impure saṃsāra arises, if one knows one's own self-appearance, there is no benefit to be done,
[11659] <tantra> Because the object of activity does not appear."
[11660] <break> <tantra> Once arisen, benefit must be done, || 11660 ||
[11661] <break> <tantra> Because liberation is impossible without exhausting deluded appearance."
[11662] <tantra> This key point is subtle yet of great importance."
[11663] <tantra> This key point is subtle yet of great importance."
[11664] <prose> Second, the detailed explanation of the faults and virtues of philosophical analysis has three parts:
[11665] <prose> The general presentation of the eight aspects of virtue,
[11666] <prose> The division into faults and virtues through conditions,
[11667] <prose> Establishing the philosophical analysis of the manner of arising and ceasing appearance.
[11668] <ornament> The first:
[11669] <prose> If spontaneous presence were not spontaneously established in the primordial ground,
[11670] <prose> The meaning of ground-appearance arising would not exist, and || 11670 ||
[11671] <prose> Without the manner of ground-appearance spontaneous presence arising,
[11672] <prose> The meaning of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arising would not exist;
[11673] <prose> Therefore the inner expanse appears as subtle, the outer expanse as coarse,
[11674] <prose> Demonstrating the gate of ground-appearance.
[11675] <prose> Moreover, the mind itself is the expanse of clear light;
[11676] <prose> If from the spontaneous self-tone compassion did not arise as the producer,
[11677] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as two sides could not exist as tamer and tamed for each other.
[11678] <prose> The self-appearance of sentient beings is deluded,
[11679] <prose> The self-face of Buddhas is utterly pure;
[11680] <prose> Because appearances are not the same. || 11680 ||
[11681] <prose> Though appearances are not the same, the benefit of sentient beings arises because compassion exists in the ground, arising from ground-appearance,
[11682] <prose> The connection of tamer and tamed exists;
[11683] <tantra> From the Secret Essence:
[11684] <tantra> "Through the connection of great compassion,
[11685] <tantra> The six migrations appear without exception in time."
[11686] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11687] <prose> Likewise, if the ground of light-ray rigpa and appearance did not exist, the meaning of the five elements appearing separately would not exist,
[11688] <prose> Without that, rigpa would be internally blocked,
[11689] <prose> With no elements at all, the appearance of container and contained would not arise;
[11690] <prose> Because light-like appearance exists, that is its virtue. || 11690 ||
[11691] <prose> If there were no non-dual appearance, the three gates could not connect as one;
[11692] <prose> The three, body, speech, and mind of sentient beings,
[11693] <prose> The three bodies of Buddhas without separation is the virtue.
[11694] <prose> If form-like appearance did not exist, bodies would have no meaning to appear; that appearance of wandering beings' bodies and victorious ones' bodies exists is the virtue.
[11695] <break> <prose> Furthermore, if wisdom-like appearance did not exist, there would be the fault of no wisdom appearance of the path connecting beyond saṃsāra;
[11696] <break> <prose> Because this exists, the appearance of the four wisdoms of path exists, that is the virtue.
[11697] <prose> Because beyond-extremes-like appearance exists, Buddhas arise not returning from externals;
[11698] <prose> Without that they would not arise, — therefore that too is the virtue.
[11699] <prose> If impure-gate-like appearance did not exist in spontaneously present original presence,
[11700] <prose> Sentient beings appearing in saṃsāra would have no meaning to come to this rigpa-face; || 11700 ||
[11701] <prose> Because that exists, appearing as the six migrations' individual appearances is also that virtue;
[11702] <tantra> From the Powerful One:
[11703] <tantra> "In spontaneous presence manifestly appearing as saṃsāra and the lower realms."
[11704] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11705] <prose> Consequently, if the gate of pure wisdom did not exist, the appearance of nirvāṇa would have no meaning to come;
[11706] <prose> Because that exists, the appearance of Buddhas in the rigpa-face exists, that is the virtue of existence.
[11707] <prose> Moreover, spontaneous presence has gates of seeing whether pure or impure appear, like windows exist;
[11708] <prose> But pure and impure do not exist in the ground itself.
[11709] <prose> Thus, counting the eight aspects of virtue in the eight modes of spontaneous presence appearance is the philosophical analysis;
[11710] <tantra> From the Precious Heap: || 11710 ||
[11711] <tantra> "From the eight gates of appearance,
[11712] <tantra> Appear in the manner of eight virtues.
[11713] <tantra> Cutting the escape hole of the six migrations,
[11714] <tantra> Those who cut the binding rope of saṃsāra,
[11715] <tantra> Through the hook of compassion,
[11716] <tantra> For sentient beings of the four modes of birth,
[11717] <tantra> Appear as great compassion itself.
[11718] <tantra> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa self-related as virtue,
[11719] <tantra> Appear in the manner of mixing the two aspects.
[11720] <tantra> Without this, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would be cut as separate sides, || 11720 ||
[11721] <tantra> Becoming the fault of no realization.
[11722] <tantra> This is the manner of virtues arising.
[11723] <tantra> In the self-realm of all Buddhas,
[11724] <tantra> Like body and shadow,
[11725] <tantra> Because the five lights of appearance pervade,
[11726] <tantra> The inner appearance aspect self-clear,
[11727] <tantra> From the gate of appearance in the manner of five lights,
[11728] <tantra> The virtue clarifier does not stray outward.
[11729] <tantra> Without this, sentient beings' self-light
[11730] <tantra> Would become blocked and cut off separately. || 11730 ||
[11731] <tantra> Because the arising connector of union appears,
[11732] <tantra> Self-appearance arose as great virtue.
[11733] <tantra> Because all bodies are condensed as one,
[11734] <tantra> The three bodies abide as one,
[11735] <tantra> In the nature of essence-body,
[11736] <tantra> Not separating within self-appearance,
[11737] <tantra> The essence clarifier appears as five bodies.
[11738] <tantra> Without this, essence is not found,
[11739] <tantra> All bodies appear like the complete body.
[11740] <tantra> All these without being different, || 11740 ||
[11741] <tantra> Abiding equally as non-dual,
[11742] <tantra> Through appearance without separation, non-dual,
[11743] <tantra> In the manner of great pervasion,
[11744] <tantra> Appears pervading outer and inner.
[11745] <tantra> Without this, with self-face different,
[11746] <tantra> The juncture of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa mixing is not found.
[11747] <tantra> Not liberated from one's own ground,
[11748] <tantra> Becomes the fault of no reversal.
[11749] <tantra> The appearance maker appears as virtue manner.
[11750] <tantra> Because self-pervading all knowables, || 11750 ||
[11751] <tantra> In the great appearance of ground-path,
[11752] <tantra> Appears as the path of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa connection.
[11753] <tantra> Without this, ground-path not found,
[11754] <tantra> In the path of the four wisdoms,
[11755] <tantra> In the secret path of sentient beings,
[11756] <tantra> Also in the manner of four appearances,
[11757] <tantra> Simultaneously and gradually,
[11758] <tantra> While sense gates exist, they appear.
[11759] <tantra> Beyond the stains of four extremes,
[11760] <tantra> The unobstructed virtue appearance maker, || 11760 ||
[11761] <tantra> In the great manner of beyond-extremes appearance,
[11762] <tantra> From the great spontaneous self-completion,
[11763] <tantra> To practice in definite primordial purity,
[11764] <tantra> In the wisdom of extremes and center,
[11765] <tantra> This itself self-arisen, self-appeared,
[11766] <tantra> In the appearance liberated from extremes,
[11767] <tantra> Appears connected with essence itself.
[11768] <tantra> Without this, definite attainment not obtained,
[11769] <tantra> The fault of cause-effect reversal occurs,
[11770] <tantra> Therefore appearing truly as beyond-extremes. || 11770 ||
[11771] <tantra> Virtue appearance manner unobstructed,
[11772] <tantra> As the source producing saṃsāra,
[11773] <tantra> Like the impure gate of appearance,
[11774] <tantra> Appears without ceasing in manner of arising.
[11775] <tantra> Without this, delusion without name,
[11776] <tantra> Therefore the gate of impure saṃsāra,
[11777] <tantra> As the cause-rope of existences,
[11778] <tantra> Appears in unobstructed manner of appearance.
[11779] <tantra> Called the gate of impure saṃsāra.
[11780] <tantra> Because sudden-transcending wisdom exists, || 11780 ||
[11781] <tantra> Purity itself demonstrates purity.
[11782] <prose> Appearance maker, appearance, individual paths,
[11783] <tantra> To the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11784] <tantra> Appears as threefold self-liberated.
[11785] <tantra> Without this, self-power not complete,
[11786] <tantra> To the gate of pure great wisdom,
[11787] <tantra> Appears to realize essence primordial purity."
[11788] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11789] <prose> Second, the division into faults and virtues through conditions:
[11790] <prose> Camphor at that time appears as virtue for hot disease, || 11790 ||
[11791] <prose> Though appearing as fault for cold disease;
[11792] <prose> Yet the nature of camphor is not established as fault or virtue.
[11793] <prose> Likewise, the ground and ground-appearance manner of appearing appears as virtue for those knowing self-face as liberation condition,
[11794] <prose> Though appearing as fault for those making partial delusion ground-hope not knowing;
[11795] <prose> The ground and its appearance are not established as fault or virtue.
[11796] <prose> Moreover, from the aspect of delusion reversal manner in the place of spontaneous presence,
[11797] <prose> Because wandering beings are primordial Buddhas,
[11798] <prose> Fault itself appears as virtue, adverse conditions appear as helpers,
[11799] <prose> Faults are primordially self-liberated in their own purity.
[11800] <tantra> From the aspect of spontaneous presence power-appearance face, || 11800 ||
[11801] <prose> Because appearing like wisdom,
[11802] <prose> According to delusion entry manner, deluded as the form of affliction-fault,
[11803] <tantra> From the power of spontaneous presence simultaneously reversing desired delusion,
[11804] <prose> Appearing as self-settled without establishing self, fault becomes virtue;
[11805] <prose> Obstacles become siddhis,
[11806] <prose> Obstructing demons and afflictions are not found,
[11807] <prose> Not observing virtue, the four wisdoms practice self-liberated.
[11808] <tantra> From the aspect of spontaneous presence appearance manner appearing as non-dual,
[11809] <prose> According to delusion entry manner, self and other arise as two,
[11810] <prose> According to delusion reversal manner, not divided as self and other, || 11810 ||
[11811] <prose> Established as self-settled without fabrication,
[11812] <prose> Selfless emptiness established as virtue, faults not found when sought,
[11813] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa non-dual Buddha.
[11814] <prose> Moreover, from spontaneous presence appearance manner appearing as beyond-extremes,
[11815] <prose> According to saṃsāra entry manner, elaborations deluded as faults below,
[11816] <prose> According to delusion reversal manner,
[11817] <prose> Two extremes become center, extreme delusions self-liberated, delusion appears as wisdom, Buddha.
[11818] <prose> Moreover, from the virtue aspect of spontaneous presence arising as pure wisdom gate,
[11819] <prose> According to saṃsāra entry manner appearing as impure delusion,
[11820] <prose> According to delusion reversal manner, liberated as originally pure power-completion, Buddha. || 11820 ||
[11821] <prose> Moreover, from the appearance aspect of spontaneous presence arising as impure saṃsāra gate,
[11822] <prose> Two aspects of saṃsāra manner:
[11823] <tantra> From here deluded downward thus,
[11824] <prose> In the final bardo, spontaneous presence jewel not producing definite confidence, delusion of existence bardo.
[11825] <prose> According to delusion reversal manner, liberated in non-distracted abiding purity, Buddha.
[11826] <prose> Moreover, essence primordial purity free from elaborations,
[11827] <prose> Nature spontaneous presence virtue complete manner arising,
[11828] <prose> For those not realizing ground, faults arise as spontaneous presence.
[11829] <prose> Each of these six actual grounds can be liberated through sharp faculties, six liberation manners on top of unceasing existence liberation.
[11830] <prose> If deluded from above, not knowing delusion reversal, gradually deluded like the six stages, || 11830 ||
[11831] <prose> Called the impure gate,
[11832] <tantra> From delusion becoming coarse,
[11833] <prose> Miraculous birth and egg-born from light, body established.
[11834] <prose> Gradual liberation from bardo also attains stability, wisdom power completes, liberation manner seven certain,
[11835] <prose> There realization not born, habituation short time, inferior faculties,
[11836] <prose> Ground not grasped there, existence bardo appears,
[11837] <prose> Reaching the following appearance.
[11838] <prose> Therefore delusion-ground and
[11839] <prose> Liberation-ground both touch the spontaneous presence gate, understand well.
[11840] <prose> Third, establishing the philosophical analysis of arising-ceasing appearance manner has two: || 11840 ||
[11841] <prose> This and
[11842] <prose> The bardo.
[11843] <prose> When diligent individuals take into experience in this life,
[11844] <prose> That ground abiding in the heart, the inner tone ground-appearance aspect light-essence and outer space appearing as impure saṃsāra gate dharmatā directly appears chiefly,
[11845] <prose> Light-appearance and
[11846] <prose> Outer earth stones inner elaborations etc. appear to senses.
[11847] <prose> The appearance and awareness experiences when taking the wisdom gate into experience.
[11848] <prose> Light-like appearance experience increasing above.
[11849] <prose> Form-like appearance, rigpa reaches measure.
[11850] <prose> At the time of dharmatā exhaustion, appears as non-dual and beyond-extremes. || 11850 ||
[11851] <prose> Compassion-like appearance, all times inner wisdom and arising compassions.
[11852] <prose> These complete, outer ground-appearance essence dissolves, ground original liberation.
[11853] <prose> In the bardo first, that ground appears as primordial purity appearance,
[11854] <prose> Ground-appearance aspect appears as clear light,
[11855] <tantra> From spontaneous presence appearance form-like appearance gathers.
[11856] <prose> Wisdom and light-like appearance four practices.
[11857] <tantra> From spontaneous presence jewel appearance pure wisdom and
[11858] <prose> Impure saṃsāra gate two.
[11859] <prose> Knowing self-face, compassion and
[11860] <prose> Non-dual and || 11860 ||
[11861] <prose> Beyond-extremes-like appearance,
[11862] <prose> Dissolves into power-ground, liberation.
[11863] <prose> Thus because ground-appearance exists in ground, when taking into experience and
[11864] <prose> Bardo and
[11865] <prose> Hence, first when deluded as sentient being, whatever, the essential point of eight mode appearance arising exists.
[11866] <break> <prose> Buddhas and sentient beings too are only appearance self-face knowing or not,
[11867] <break> <prose> saṃsāra nirvāṇa rigpa cause one, like palm and back of hand.
[11868] <prose> This present appearance too from impure gate appearance like eight examples of illusion only,
[11869] <prose> Outer inner objectless ground-free equal wide only,
[11870] <prose> Need not abandon. || 11870 ||
[11871] <prose> Need not adopt, when other appearance arises traceless great self-reversal,
[11872] <prose> Like waking from sleep dreams reverse,
[11873] <prose> Self-reversal to ground-liberation, going to primordial emptiness alone, understanding one essential point well, effortless universal liberation.
[11874] <prose> Third, demonstrating dissolution into the primordial ground:
[11875] <prose> Thus the great appearances arising from ground, whether knowing self-face or not,
[11876] <prose> Like crystal light dissolving inward,
[11877] <prose> Like former dream ceasing when latter appears, passing through the yol,
[11878] <prose> All appearance gone to nothing,
[11879] <tantra> From original tone inward reversal,
[11880] <prose> Not going elsewhere, || 11880 ||
[11881] <prose> Like not going elsewhere from dissolving in the nature of two dreams.
[11882] <prose> Moreover, when particularly awake, dream appearances knowing inwardly dissolve, not going elsewhere anywhere.
[11883] <prose> How is the dissolution manner?
[11884] <tantra> From the Precious Heap Tantra:
[11885] <tantra> "Alas, Vajra Speech listen,
[11886] <tantra> All these fault-virtue appearance manners,
[11887] <tantra> Rigpa's own virtue or
[11888] <tantra> Play power dissolution manner eight.
[11889] <tantra> Spontaneous presence ground without certainty,
[11890] <tantra> Virtue manner thus thus. || 11890 ||
[11891] <tantra> Compassion itself to compassion,
[11892] <tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11893] <tantra> Without establishment obtaining manner,
[11894] <tantra> Passes to actionless expanse.
[11895] <tantra> Non-acting, nothing at all,
[11896] <tantra> All activities nirvāṇa.
[11897] <tantra> Unmade action without appearance,
[11898] <tantra> All compounded pure expanse.
[11899] <tantra> That itself self-dissolved to self,
[11900] <tantra> Not going elsewhere. || 11900 ||
[11901] <tantra> For example, to the sun's heart,
[11902] <tantra> Its own rays self-dissolve like,
[11903] <tantra> With its own tone included,
[11904] <tantra> All dream-appearances nirvāṇa.
[11905] <tantra> All these virtue precious jewel,
[11906] <tantra> Not abiding in fault, own ground.
[11907] <tantra> Self-light self-dissolved,
[11908] <tantra> This too appears as great virtue.
[11909] <tantra> Self-nature utterly pure,
[11910] <tantra> Marks holding attachment objects cease. || 11910 ||
[11911] <tantra> Though outer four elements coarse,
[11912] <break> <tantra> Not seen here, attachment reverses.
[11913] <break> <tantra> From self-pure great emptiness,
[11914] <tantra> Color self-grasping nirvāṇa.
[11915] <tantra> This too not gone elsewhere,
[11916] <tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11917] <tantra> All appearances nirvāṇa.
[11918] <tantra> Light mandala self-dissolved,
[11919] <tantra> For example, sky rainbow itself,
[11920] <tantra> Like self-dissolving in sky itself, || 11920 ||
[11921] <tantra> In great non-discriminating expanse,
[11922] <tantra> All grasping attachments nirvāṇa.
[11923] <tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11924] <tantra> Virtue manner thus thus.
[11925] <tantra> Wisdom itself to wisdom,
[11926] <tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11927] <tantra> Awareness grasping thoughts memories,
[11928] <tantra> Self-abiding equality expanse,
[11929] <tantra> All non-dual nirvāṇa.
[11930] <tantra> Individual wisdom appearance aspects too, || 11930 ||
[11931] <tantra> In the center of unmade expanse,
[11932] <tantra> Without ceasing nirvāṇa.
[11933] <tantra> That itself self-dissolved to self,
[11934] <tantra> All wisdom play diversities,
[11935] <tantra> Self-face not-dissolved is
[11936] <tantra> Like child entering mother's lap,
[11937] <tantra> Self-wisdom self-confidence,
[11938] <break> <tantra> Self-nature nirvāṇa.
[11939] <break> <tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11940] <tantra> Also virtue dissolution manner. || 11940 ||
[11941] <tantra> Body itself body self-dissolved,
[11942] <tantra> All forms non-conceptual great,
[11943] <tantra> Without appearance nirvāṇa.
[11944] <tantra> Coarse included elements and
[11945] <tantra> Subtle held non-recognition etc.
[11946] <tantra> Without action nirvāṇa.
[11947] <tantra> Bodies self-face dissolved,
[11948] <tantra> Awareness arising aspect not straying outward.
[11949] <tantra> Like vase body form example,
[11950] <tantra> Inner clear outer movements || 11950 ||
[11951] <break> <tantra> Nature extinguished in own place.
[11952] <break> <tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11953] <tantra> Also virtue thus thus.
[11954] <tantra> Non-dual non-dual self-dissolved,
[11955] <tantra> Number-grasping attachments
[11956] <tantra> Unique free from elaborations
[11957] <tantra> Non-two one manner too
[11958] <tantra> Self-dissolved nirvāṇa.
[11959] <tantra> Two-appearing self-dissolved,
[11960] <tantra> Like river to river || 11960 ||
[11961] <tantra> Dissolving like, not dividing difference,
[11962] <tantra> Non-divided great nirvāṇa.
[11963] <tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11964] <tantra> Unceasing virtue thus thus.
[11965] <tantra> Beyond-extremes itself to beyond-extremes,
[11966] <tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11967] <tantra> All body-speech grasping continuums,
[11968] <tantra> Bodies exhausted nirvāṇa.
[11969] <tantra> Extreme itself self-pure self-dissolved,
[11970] <tantra> Like sky to sky || 11970 ||
[11971] <tantra> Dissolving like, no face grasping,
[11972] <tantra> Four extreme thought-attachments self-ceased,
[11973] <tantra> Non-abiding great nirvāṇa.
[11974] <tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11975] <tantra> Appearance virtue thus thus.
[11976] <tantra> Impure saṃsāra self-entry gate,
[11977] <tantra> To essence's pure gate,
[11978] <tantra> Dissolve in manner of not going.
[11979] <tantra> Like bird snare threads,
[11980] <tantra> Gathered by tamer to center like, || 11980 ||
[11981] <tantra> Sense activity objects nirvāṇa.
[11982] <tantra> This itself virtue precious jewel,
[11983] <tantra> Thus virtue aspects complete.
[11984] <tantra> Pure wisdom gate itself,
[11985] <tantra> Self-nature self-dissolved,
[11986] <tantra> Body and wisdom nirvāṇa.
[11987] <tantra> Like lion touching snow,
[11988] <tantra> Non-returning fearlessness confidence obtained.
[11989] <tantra> This too virtue precious jewel,
[11990] <tantra> Thus virtue arising manner's || 11990 ||
[11991] <tantra> Abiding as one wisdom ground,
[11992] <tantra> Unsought self-finding,
[11993] <tantra> Primordially that own nature."
[11994] <tantra> Thus it is.
[11995] <prose> This manner is the difficult point of Secret Essence Heart Drop;
[11996] <tantra> Though clearly taught in tantras and oral instructions,
[11997] <prose> Not even slight ability arose here in Tibet before,
[11998] <prose> Therefore I have clearly distinguished and taught it;
[11999] <prose> Henceforth knowing this essential point, know the power of these words.
[12000] <prose> Second, Samantabhadra's liberation manner has three: || 12000 ||
[12001] <prose> The manner of liberation in the instant of seeing ground-appearance,
[12002] <prose> The manner of abiding in the expanse after liberation,
[12003] <prose> The manner of benefiting others from that.
[12004] <ornament> The first:
[12005] <tantra> From the primordial expanse,
[12006] <prose> Inner tone outwardly projected,
[12007] <prose> Compassion-rigpa self-non-recognition aspect arisen just that, looking outward to ground-appearance,
[12008] <prose> In the instant of recognizing this as one's own appearance inwardly,
[12009] <prose> Non-recognition self-pure from ground-appearance spontaneous presence manner self-dissolved, abiding self-place in primordial purity ground.
[12010] <prose> Moreover, distinguishing particularities in the instant of self-appearance, || 12010 ||
[12011] <prose> Buddha in an instant,
[12012] <prose> The Teacher who came before as playful,
[12013] <tantra> From the Talgyur:
[12014] <tantra> "Thus saṃsāra and nirvāṇa from beginning and end,
[12015] <tantra> Buddha not deluded,
[12016] <tantra> By faculties transcending ground,
[12017] <tantra> Self-appearance natureless known,
[12018] <tantra> Thought investigation mind not straying outward,
[12019] <tantra> Movement self-decided."
[12020] <tantra> Thus and, || 12020 ||
[12021] <tantra> From Gongpa Khandro Gyud:
[12022] <tantra> "At that time Samantabhadra six dharmas,
[12023] <tantra> Ground known, six non-recognitions conquered,
[12024] <tantra> Merely calm mind merely empty,
[12025] <break> <tantra> Merely rigpa arising, rigpa-decrease destroyed,
[12026] <break> <tantra> By clarity clear, darkness dispelled,
[12027] <tantra> By ease arising, no thickening,
[12028] <break> <tantra> Free from additions, non-recognition pure,
[12029] <break> <tantra> Unchanging like sky.
[12030] <tantra> Moreover, Vajrasattva listen, || 12030 ||
[12031] <tantra> Delusion non-recognition reversed conquered,
[12032] <tantra> Neutral self-destroyed empty,
[12033] <tantra> Inert-rigpa distinguished, ground and meet,
[12034] <tantra> Therefore non-recognition darkness dispelled,
[12035] <tantra> Like sun rising on mountain."
[12036] <tantra> Thus and,
[12037] <tantra> From Self-Arisen Bliss Wheel Tantra:
[12038] <tantra> "From merely calm rigpa arising,
[12039] <tantra> By ease clear, free from additions."
[12040] <tantra> Thus and, || 12040 ||
[12041] <tantra> From Mayajala:
[12042] <tantra> "In one instant particularities distinguished,
[12043] <tantra> In one instant complete Buddha."
[12044] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12045] <prose> Though renowned that Samantabhadra Buddha without doing even a particle of virtue from ground primordially,
[12046] <prose> Analyzing, knowing self-face is the ocean of uncontrived self-arisen virtue,
[12047] <prose> Great accumulations originally complete,
[12048] <prose> Neutral non-recognition dispelled, obscurations primordially conquered,
[12049] <prose> Knowing as self-appearance, non-recognition dispelled,
[12050] <prose> That dispelled, all afflictions dispelled, || 12050 ||
[12051] <prose> Because arising from dispelled non-recognition.
[12052] <prose> At that time, self-abiding virtue manifestly arisen, Buddha in body and wisdom.
[12053] <prose> Saying liberated primordially from ground is rough,
[12054] <prose> Because liberated when ground-appearance arises from ground,
[12055] <prose> Liberated in the instant transcending ground.
[12056] <prose> Where liberated?
[12057] <prose> Saying liberated primordially from ground is also rough,
[12058] <prose> Liberated in the place of ultimate spontaneous presence.
[12059] <prose> If liberated primordially from ground, would reverse,
[12060] <prose> Because ground established as capable of delusion arising, || 12060 ||
[12061] <prose> Because ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[12062] <prose> Liberation place itself is the beginning,
[12063] <prose> Is ground the beginning?
[12064] <prose> Explained as beginning in nature, but
[12065] <prose> Not the first ground.
[12066] <prose> In brief, when knowing self-face, expanse virtue ultimate,
[12067] <prose> Liberated as fruition free from obscurations.
[12068] <prose> Therefore body, wisdom etc. virtues arising ground-abiding measure called expanse virtue,
[12069] <prose> Existing in rigpa, but
[12070] <prose> Because not manifest. || 12070 ||
[12071] <prose> At completion time called Buddha virtue,
[12072] <prose> Because dispelled non-recognition, by dispelled power own virtues appearing, expanded.
[12073] <prose> Or ground spontaneous presence Buddha virtue and
[12074] <prose> Fruition manifest accomplished Buddha virtue assertion.
[12075] <prose> Thus Samantabhadra Buddha,
[12076] <prose> Six dharmas:
[12077] <prose> Transcending ground,
[12078] <prose> Self-face appearance,
[12079] <prose> Distinguishing particularities,
[12080] <prose> Liberated above distinguishing, || 12080 ||
[12081] <prose> Not arising from other,
[12082] <prose> Abiding self-place.
[12083] <prose> These too, fruition not arising from cause,
[12084] <prose> Buddha not arising from mind,
[12085] <prose> Oral instruction not arising from scripture, self-arisen, Buddha.
[12086] <prose> Original ground and ground-appearance fruition liberation,
[12087] <prose> Done by realizing wisdom,
[12088] <tantra> From the Blazing Lamp Tantra:
[12089] <tantra> "Ground itself ripening as fruition is wisdom,
[12090] <tantra> Wisdom ripening as body, || 12090 ||
[12091] <tantra> That essence nature Dharmakāya,
[12092] <tantra> Ripens as wisdom Dharmakāya.
[12093] <tantra> By that wisdom stream unceasing,
[12094] <tantra> Body and wisdom spontaneous presence clear."
[12095] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12096] <prose> At that time, all aspects of knowable objects appearing outwardly, knowing self-face inwardly, all-knowing Buddha,
[12097] <prose> Self-face abiding inner-clear as youthful vase body, from dharmatā nature,
[12098] <prose> Investigating fabrications peaceful, all-knowing Buddha.
[12099] <prose> Though knowing all, not moving from self-face dharmatā,
[12100] <prose> Inner abiding awareness and || 12100 ||
[12101] <prose> Outer seeing awareness aspects,
[12102] <prose> By aspect appearing not appearing difference,
[12103] <prose> All-knowing wisdom and
[12104] <prose> All-aspect-knowing wisdom and
[12105] <prose> All-aspect-knowing wisdom called.
[12106] <prose> These two reversal different, essence one, inner abiding all-knowing.
[12107] <prose> Second, the manner of abiding in the expanse after liberation:
[12108] <prose> Primordial purity spontaneous presence virtue manifestly arisen, like crystal light gathered inward,
[12109] <prose> Self-face inner-clear youthful vase body abiding,
[12110] <prose> Dharmakāya primordial purity essence centerless boundless expanse height great expanse, || 12110 ||
[12111] <prose> Within spontaneous presence depth-clear five lights palace arrangement,
[12112] <prose> Rigpa empty aspect dharmatā Samantabhadri, appearance aspect Dharmakāya Samantabhadra self-clear,
[12113] <prose> Method and wisdom net self-connected,
[12114] <prose> Wisdom life-horse established, swift,
[12115] <prose> Five clear light inner tone unmixed, equal nature wide,
[12116] <prose> That itself unceasing, secret sun shines in expanse.
[12117] <prose> At that time, expanse five elements self-place arranged, appearance and light self-tone clear,
[12118] <prose> Depth-clear tone unceasing,
[12119] <prose> Five wisdom lights curled in expanse,
[12120] <prose> Not established as things and marks, empty, || 12120 ||
[12121] <prose> Not cut off as non-existence, well-braided,
[12122] <prose> Essence nature compassion three knots braided as one,
[12123] <prose> Rigpa light house possessor,
[12124] <prose> Light endless appearance spontaneous thick,
[12125] <prose> Liberated wisdom endless victory banner peak, ten powers,
[12126] <prose> Four fearlessnesses,
[12127] <prose> Individual knowing,
[12128] <prose> Marks,
[12129] <prose> Minor marks etc. never-ceasing nature,
[12130] <prose> Light rays endless lamp clear, || 12130 ||
[12131] <prose> Self-appearance wisdom without increase decrease,
[12132] <prose> Great compassion benefit-intending path other not traveled, self-clear,
[12133] <prose> Five body stupas five wisdom terraces,
[12134] <prose> Not moving from dharmatā seat expanse,
[12135] <prose> Skillful method great compassion empty path directions end-reached all-pervading,
[12136] <prose> Buddha and sentient beings all teacher, first, primordially abides.
[12137] <prose> Moreover, from Self-Arisen:
[12138] <break> <tantra> "Alas, supreme being, speaking lion, you listen,
[12139] <break> <tantra> Jewel arrangement heap body height great,
[12140] <tantra> Jewel palace arrangement excellent, || 12140 ||
[12141] <tantra> Jewel adorned queen ornaments beautiful,
[12142] <tantra> Jewel arrangement net equal,
[12143] <tantra> Jewel beautiful horse swift,
[12144] <tantra> On jewel various terrace inexhaustible,
[12145] <tantra> Jewel five color plain all equal,
[12146] <tantra> Jewel secret sun arising ceasing none,
[12147] <tantra> Jewel water lotus stain none,
[12148] <tantra> Jewel fire mandala stacked excellent,
[12149] <tantra> Jewel wind wisdom thought none,
[12150] <tantra> Jewel earth mandala vehicle great, || 12150 ||
[12151] <tantra> Jewel sky centerless boundless,
[12152] <tantra> Jewel blazing light arising ceasing none,
[12153] <tantra> Jewel ray garland root excellent,
[12154] <tantra> Jewel empty mandala drawn excellent,
[12155] <tantra> Jewel extreme three knots braided excellent,
[12156] <break> <tantra> Jewel depth darkness dispelling wide spontaneous thick,
[12157] <break> <tantra> Jewel ocean peak unceasing,
[12158] <tantra> Jewel blazing lamp clear light,
[12159] <tantra> Jewel secret wisdom increase decrease none,
[12160] <tantra> Jewel connection path untravelable, || 12160 ||
[12161] <tantra> Jewel body relic blazing stupa stacked excellent,
[12162] <tantra> Jewel vajra seat unchanging,
[12163] <tantra> Jewel empty path end-reached none,
[12164] <tantra> Self-abiding oral instruction taught."
[12165] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12166] <prose> These in Thigle Sangkor, earth jewel five color stupa etc. stacked excellent, accord.
[12167] <prose> Third, benefiting others from that:
[12168] <tantra> From Dharmakāya field primordial purity great expanse not moving,
[12169] <prose> Spontaneous presence gate sentient being appearance manner accompanying, benefit done,
[12170] <prose> Spontaneous presence light body power Sambhogakāya appearance arranged, || 12170 ||
[12171] <tantra> From that Brahma great eon arranged,
[12172] <prose> Natural Nirmāṇakāya appearance and
[12173] <prose> Impure saṃsāra gate wandering being appearance manner tamer Teacher sentient being realms pervading demonstrated, saṃsāra emptied.
[12174] <prose> These appear in common vehicles too,
[12175] <tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[12176] <tantra> "Uncompounded spontaneously accomplished,
[12177] <tantra> Other condition realization not,
[12178] <tantra> Possessing knowledge, love, and power,
[12179] <tantra> Buddha possessing two benefits,
[12180] <tantra> Beginning, middle, end none, || 12180 ||
[12181] <tantra> Nature therefore uncompounded,
[12182] <tantra> Peaceful Dharmakāya possessing,
[12183] <tantra> Spontaneously accomplished called.
[12184] <tantra> Self individual realizing,
[12185] <tantra> Other condition realization not,
[12186] <tantra> Thus three realizing knowledge,
[12187] <tantra> Path showing therefore love,
[12188] <tantra> Power wisdom compassion by,
[12189] <tantra> Suffering affliction dispelling.
[12190] <tantra> First three self-benefit, || 12190 ||
[12191] <tantra> Latter three other-benefit."
[12192] <tantra> Thus and,
[12193] <prose> Its commentary:
[12194] <tantra> "Thus extremely marvelous, inconceivable object Buddha,
[12195] <tantra> Without hearing from other, self Teacher-less, self-arisen wisdom indescribable nature manifestly complete Buddha,
[12196] <tantra> Following that, realizing and non-realizing blind others too, for realizing,
[12197] <tantra> For teaching path to that realization,
[12198] <tantra> Unsurpassed wisdom and
[12199] <tantra> Compassion possessing thus know."
[12200] <tantra> Thus taught. || 12200 ||
[12201] <prose> Such Teacher, first before all, attaining enlightenment,
[12202] <prose> Three times Buddhas and
[12203] <prose> Three realms sentient beings all benefit done,
[12204] <prose> Beginning and end none abiding, complete dominion Teacher Samantabhadra called.
[12205] <prose> Field and activity dharmadhatu sky-end reaching, sentient being and Buddha appearance however much, that much.
[12206] <prose> Third, the manner of non-recognition sentient being delusion:
[12207] <prose> Though no delusion in primordial ground, when ground-appearance arises, self-face non-recognition awareness neutral with rigpa root,
[12208] <prose> Ground-appearance divided into types, deluded as sentient being;
[12209] <tantra> From the Garland of Pearls:
[12210] <tantra> "From the greatly distinguished appearance, || 12210 ||
[12211] <tantra> Existence and non-existence two arise,
[12212] <tantra> Common ground delusion called,
[12213] <tantra> Because of being mixed with non-recognition itself,
[12214] <tantra> Knowables themselves appear as stains."
[12215] <tantra> Thus and,
[12216] <tantra> "Upon Dharmakāya like sky,
[12217] <tantra> Adventitious sentient being clouds obscure,
[12218] <tantra> Non-deluded dharmatā too
[12219] <tantra> Appears as deluded manner to mind."
[12220] <tantra> Cause, condition, with instantaneous, || 12220 ||
[12221] <tantra> Thus and,
[12222] <tantra> From Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra:
[12223] <tantra> "Three realm sentient beings all
[12224] <tantra> From ground not-anything deluded as anything.
[12225] <tantra> That ground essence empty,
[12226] <tantra> By nature clear,
[12227] <tantra> Compassion sentient being appearing capable."
[12228] <tantra> From that, grasping-maker awareness from non-recognition aspect arising, slight stir,
[12229] <tantra> Dark awareness that father from me arose or,
[12230] <tantra> From me that father arose, awareness arising just deluded. || 12230 ||
[12231] <tantra> That non-recognition not in ground, in experience or aspect exists.
[12232] <tantra> From aspect four conditions arise.
[12233] <tantra> Moreover, ground-light house abiding called causal condition,
[12234] <tantra> Non-recognition itself.
[12235] <tantra> From that investigation gone, dominating condition called.
[12236] <tantra> From that object-possessor held, observed condition called,
[12237] <tantra> Like demonstrating man's face in mirror example.
[12238] <tantra> These three time-equal, immediately-after condition called.
[12239] <tantra> That own ground, self not knowing, deluded, three realms saṃsāra accomplished.
[12240] <tantra> From that afflictions coarse gone, sentient being forms different arose. || 12240 ||
[12241] <tantra> From such ground deluded."
[12242] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12243] <prose> Moreover, when investigating awareness arises toward ground-appearance,
[12244] <tantra> From cause self-one non-recognition self-face not knowing aspect,
[12245] <prose> Four conditions observation impure deluded.
[12246] <prose> These manners from Auspicious Beautiful:
[12247] <break> <tantra> "Moreover, by condition-ground deluded,
[12248] <break> <tantra> End too touches four conditions.
[12249] <tantra> From cause observation-possessor grasping condition,
[12250] <tantra> Diverse result cause deluded. || 12250 ||
[12251] <tantra> Dominating object-possessor grasping condition, names diverse deluded.
[12252] <tantra> Observing mind-possessor grasping condition, result-reaching none deluded.
[12253] <tantra> Immediately-after grasping-possessor condition, appearances diverse deluded."
[12254] <tantra> This is the great ground delusion manner of Secret Mantra.
[12255] <tantra> Moreover, appearance manner non-recognition condition self self-possessing appears.
[12256] <tantra> That non-recognition too, five root afflictions possessing, gathers many elaborations.
[12257] <tantra> Conditions ten thousand possessing,
[12258] <tantra> Appearance manners many possessing,
[12259] <tantra> Appearance manner spread.
[12260] <tantra> Moreover, from spontaneous presence jewel casket nature appearance unceasing, || 12260 ||
[12261] <tantra> Ground unchanging, appearance changes,
[12262] <tantra> Following many objects,
[12263] <tantra> All conceptualizing.
[12264] <tantra> Dharmakāya appearance unchanging,
[12265] <tantra> Delusion appearance seems changing.
[12266] <tantra> Vajrasattva not possessing delusion,
[12267] <tantra> Showing delusion manner to sentient beings."
[12268] <tantra> End self-own appearance self-condition ground reversal.
[12269] <tantra> Non-dual appearance self-appearing not known,
[12270] <tantra> Grasping delusion as master, dominating condition. || 12270 ||
[12271] <tantra> Self-rigpa result self-appearing not known,
[12272] <tantra> Cause held as dependent, causal condition.
[12273] <tantra> Object and awareness empty not known,
[12274] <tantra> Observing held as object, observed own condition.
[12275] <tantra> Time not known as self-light self-arisen,
[12276] <tantra> That not that, holding awareness arises,
[12277] <tantra> Equal immediately-after condition."
[12278] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12279] <prose> Moreover, first delusion cause three non-recognitions:
[12280] <prose> Thus, <tantra> From self-face non-recognition aspect just, grasping-fixation not arising, meaning not deluded called, that deluded gone, || 12280 ||
[12281] <prose> Nameless gone to name like, cause self-one non-recognition.
[12282] <prose> That itself not knowing just, together-born non-recognition, saṃsāra nirvāṇa two appearances arising.
[12283] <prose> Thus object light-appearance mind two-appearing just distinguished aspect, name object self-grasping aspect gone, imputed non-recognition called.
[12284] <prose> Such cause, conditions four:
[12285] <prose> Causal condition thus three non-recognitions gathered done,
[12286] <prose> Like self-face body limbs possessing man's face demonstrating.
[12287] <tantra> From that observed condition like mirror, outer object outwardly projected,
[12288] <tantra> From that face existing, condition mirror inwardly appearing like,
[12289] <prose> Observed object self-light outwardly projected from,
[12290] <prose> Dominating condition mirror and || 12290 ||
[12291] <prose> Face and
[12292] <prose> Self actually held as face and mirror thought like,
[12293] <prose> Light and
[12294] <prose> Rigpa and
[12295] <prose> dharmatā three thought possessing, dominating condition called.
[12296] <prose> Thus cause non-recognition three, conditions three time-equal,
[12297] <prose> Equal immediately-after condition,
[12298] <prose> Delusion actually arisen.
[12299] <prose> These four conditions individual time,
[12300] <prose> Cause Buddha sentient being one, beyond abandonment-acceptance wisdom self-recognized, || 12300 ||
[12301] <prose> Causal condition self-place liberated.
[12302] <prose> Objects diverse appearing dharmatā self-appearance liberated from,
[12303] <prose> Observed condition objects different self-place liberated.
[12304] <prose> Moreover, manner self-arisen wisdom appearing liberated from,
[12305] <prose> Dominating condition self-place liberated.
[12306] <prose> Time certainty none, time early late mutually contradicting,
[12307] <prose> Equal immediately-after condition self-place liberated.
[12308] <prose> Thus cause condition two delusion nature done,
[12309] <prose> These two ripening result body done, gathered different arise,
[12310] <prose> Mind cause done, conceptions objects different from, || 12310 ||
[12311] <prose> Object mind different deluded,
[12312] <prose> Body mind possessing that too first instant deluded.
[12313] <prose> This itself saṃsāra beginning,
[12314] <tantra> From Talgyur:
[12315] <tantra> "saṃsāra all beginning,
[12316] <tantra> From non-discriminating unmade nature,
[12317] <tantra> Observing-grasping object arises,
[12318] <tantra> Thought-grasping from different appears.
[12319] <tantra> Observing-grasping connection twelve
[12320] <tantra> saṃsāra beginning itself. || 12320 ||
[12321] <tantra> Three non-recognitions delusion manner,
[12322] <tantra> Transmitted undiscriminating root,
[12323] <tantra> Self-face not knowing,
[12324] <tantra> This too saṃsāra beginning."
[12325] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12326] <prose> At that time, twelve dependent-origination manner arisen,
[12327] <prose> Compassion power self-face not knowing three non-recognitions arisen is non-recognition.
[12328] <prose> Four conditions saṃsāra compounded.
[12329] <tantra> From that awareness coarse object aspect engaging consciousness.
[12330] <break> <tantra> From that karma different body and name arisen is name and form. || 12330 ||
[12331] <break> <prose> That distinctions color element individual aspects established six sense-bases.
[12332] <tantra> From that object engaging contact.
[12333] <tantra> From that joy grief middle three arising feeling.
[12334] <tantra> From that pleasure desiring, suffering not wanting awareness craving.
[12335] <tantra> From that object accepting grasping.
[12336] <tantra> From that karma and afflictions increase, future birth projecting karma becoming accomplished is becoming.
[12337] <tantra> From that wandering different born is birth.
[12338] <tantra> From that mature aging and dying aging and death.
[12339] <prose> That too first from my twelve wheels deluded.
[12340] <prose> Wherein, one life too clear light ceasing, existence bardo appearance possible first instant self-face not knowing non-recognition, || 12340 ||
[12341] <break> <prose> Outer breath cut dying,
[12342] <break> <prose> That between dependent-origination manner entered.
[12343] <tantra> From that coarse subtle dissolution manner casket male stages reversed,
[12344] <prose> Delusion appearance ceasing, saṃsāra returning,
[12345] <prose> nirvāṇa self-arisen nature first primordial purity appearance arising,
[12346] <prose> dharmatā bardo appearances primordial nirvāṇa dependent-origination manifestly appearing.
[12347] <prose> There self-face not knowing too deluded,
[12348] <prose> Knowing liberated, saṃsāra experience nirvāṇa liberated called.
[12349] <prose> That too ground and ground-appearance
[12350] <prose> Both non-recognition not existing, like clouds adventitiously arisen, || 12350 ||
[12351] <prose> Impure saṃsāra gate manner arising cause done,
[12352] <prose> Three realms six migrations individually deluded.
[12353] <tantra> From the Garland of Pearls:
[12354] <tantra> "Upon such abiding dharmatā,
[12355] <tantra> Delusion primordially not existing,
[12356] <tantra> Dharmakāya like sky,
[12357] <tantra> Adventitious sentient being clouds obscured."
[12358] <tantra> Thus and,
[12359] <tantra> From ground-appearance great that itself,
[12360] <tantra> Non-recognition imputed not, || 12360 ||
[12361] <tantra> Delusion accomplished not existing."
[12362] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12363] <prose> Adventitiously forcefully imputed, impure saṃsāra dharma arisen,
[12364] <tantra> From that itself:
[12365] <tantra> "Thus three worlds themselves,
[12366] <tantra> Five aggregates and five senses,
[12367] <tantra> Five limbs and five essences,
[12368] <tantra> Five objects and five afflictions,
[12369] <tantra> Five minds five mentations five thoughts,
[12370] <tantra> Grasping-fixation saṃsāra itself accomplished." || 12370 ||
[12371] <tantra> Thus and,
[12372] <tantra> "Earth water fire wind space too,
[12373] <tantra> Great elements from that arisen.
[12374] <tantra> Gods and titans humans,

[12376] <tantra> Great from that truly arisen.
[12377] <tantra> Desire anger delusion,
[12378] <tantra> Pride jealousy etc.
[12379] <tantra> From that miracle arises.
[12380] <tantra> Non-recognition sentient being minds, || 12380 ||
[12381] <tantra> Aggregates elements and sense-bases,
[12382] <tantra> Consciousness collections and,
[12383] <tantra> Five senses etc. arisen.
[12384] <tantra> Sound and smell and taste,
[12385] <tantra> Touch and desirable objects,
[12386] <tantra> From that in the manner of karma arisen.
[12387] <tantra> Hoard and Yama stick and,
[12388] <tantra> Essence-none etc. too,
[12389] <tantra> From that power and play arisen.
[12390] <tantra> Alaya and appropriation's || 12390 ||
[12391] <tantra> Flesh and blood and lymph,
[12392] <tantra> Bones and skin and hair,
[12393] <tantra> Gathered bodies from that arisen."
[12394] <tantra> Thus it is.
[12395] <prose> At that time six non-recognitions too self-possessed arise,
[12396] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[12397] <tantra> "Non-recognition thus:
[12398] <tantra> Root mind non-recognition,
[12399] <tantra> Delusion object non-recognition,
[12400] <tantra> Delusion-ground ground non-recognition, || 12400 ||
[12401] <tantra> Grasping thought non-recognition,
[12402] <tantra> Fabrication path non-recognition,
[12403] <tantra> Not knowing ignorance non-recognition,
[12404] <tantra> Thus non-recognition six types arise,
[12405] <tantra> Self-appearance not seeing.
[12406] <tantra> Moreover thus:
[12407] <tantra> Root mind non-recognition is together-born actual,
[12408] <tantra> Rigpa wisdom not knowing deluded,
[12409] <tantra> To me wisdom appearance this arose or,
[12410] <tantra> My appearance this not thus awareness arising, || 12410 ||
[12411] <tantra> Arrogance arising, together-born root non-recognition,
[12412] <tantra> Self-grasping thought arising, deluded.
[12413] <tantra> From that rigpa wisdom appearance obscured.
[12414] <tantra> That is root mind non-recognition called.
[12415] <tantra> Now delusion object non-recognition demonstrated:
[12416] <tantra> Delusion by what deluded?
[12417] <tantra> Object first world not-yet-established,
[12418] <tantra> Wish-fulfilling tree spreading called,
[12419] <tantra> Buddha youthful vase body blessing arisen tree,
[12420] <tantra> Egg-born warmth moisture born from, || 12420 ||
[12421] <tantra> From that mind self-arisen wisdom called, stirred, this world established.
[12422] <tantra> That is delusion object non-recognition called.
[12423] <tantra> Delusion-ground ground non-recognition:
[12424] <tantra> Delusion-ground self self impure arisen from,
[12425] <tantra> First causal condition called actual non-recognition arisen,
[12426] <tantra> Ground not knowing non-recognition.
[12427] <tantra> From that observed condition called delusion object non-recognition like.
[12428] <tantra> From that dominating condition called tree self grasping arose,
[12429] <tantra> From that immediately-after condition called,
[12430] <tantra> Awareness coarse gone grasping grasped. || 12430 ||
[12431] <tantra> From that afflictions coarse gone.
[12432] <tantra> That is delusion-ground non-recognition called.
[12433] <tantra> Grasping thought non-recognition:
[12434] <tantra> From that affliction collections endless arisen.
[12435] <tantra> Moreover thus:
[12436] <tantra> Six grasping minds arisen.
[12437] <tantra> Non-recognition equal mind and
[12438] <tantra> Mind consciousness mind and
[12439] <tantra> All-searching mind and
[12440] <tantra> Deciding mind and || 12440 ||
[12441] <tantra> Various coarse mind and
[12442] <tantra> Definitely establishing mind."
[12443] <tantra> Moreover thus:
[12444] <tantra> Non-recognition equal-possessing mind thus:
[12445] <tantra> Root actual non-recognition,
[12446] <tantra> Mind movement possessing.
[12447] <tantra> That is non-recognition equal-possessing mind.
[12448] <tantra> Mind consciousness object mine thinking awareness grasping,
[12449] <tantra> Me and self held, affliction power gone, mind consciousness called.
[12450] <tantra> Deciding mind: || 12450 ||
[12451] <tantra> Object mine object thinking awareness grasping, from that attachment arising, deciding called.
[12452] <tantra> All-searching mind object power gone, all subtle afflictions moon gathering.
[12453] <tantra> Therefore all-searching mind called.
[12454] <tantra> Various coarse mind affliction coarse life-taking and
[12455] <tantra> Commitment-breaking karma many doing.
[12456] <tantra> Definitely establishing mind:
[12457] <tantra> These appearances mine and
[12458] <tantra> Other's thus that definitely establishing mind.
[12459] <tantra> That is grasping thought non-recognition called.
[12460] <tantra> Fabrication path non-recognition: || 12460 ||
[12461] <tantra> Six minds gathered wisdom path obscured,
[12462] <tantra> Moreover mind not seeing wisdom, not clearly giving,
[12463] <tantra> No thought in wisdom,
[12464] <tantra> From mind movement existing,
[12465] <tantra> Buddha path obscuration.
[12466] <tantra> That is fabrication path non-recognition called.
[12467] <tantra> Not knowing ignorance non-recognition self-appearance light in existing not knowing, again and again circling, circling in saṃsāra.
[12468] <tantra> That is not knowing ignorance non-recognition.
[12469] <tantra> Thus six non-recognitions arisen, wisdom appearance not knowing."
[12470] <tantra> Thus it is. || 12470 ||
[12471] <prose> These are non-recognition sentient being delusion manner;
[12472] <prose> First spontaneous presence self-arisen from,
[12473] <prose> Self-face not knowing rigpa from,
[12474] <prose> End delusion ceasing time, following impure thick stains whatever, that is saṃsāra beginning and end, not Buddha end.
[12475] <tantra> From the Precious Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[12476] <prose> Thus concludes the ninth chapter: The Manner of Spontaneous Presence Appearance.
[12477] <prose> Thus having demonstrated the sequence of liberation and delusion from expanse appearance,
