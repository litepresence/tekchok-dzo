[4156] <ornament> First, regarding bodily conduct that requires settling with necessity:
[4157] <tantra> From the Single Son of Buddha:
[4158] <prose> The body—running and lying down,
[4159] <prose> Rising and moving the limbs,
[4160] <prose> Circumambulating and making prostrations, || 4160 ||
[4161] <prose> Turning the limbs and bowing the head,
[4162] <prose> Whatever actions one remembers—
[4163] <prose> Dance and mudra transformations,
[4164] <prose> Whatever activities one engages in visualization:
[4165] <prose> Thus, whoever performs these,
[4166] <prose> Through naturally cutting the body's attachment,
[4167] <prose> Completely splitting open the body's attachment:
[4168] <prose> By this, one becomes the transformative body.
[4169] <prose> Thus it is said.
[4170] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4170 ||
[4171] <prose> The body—going and abiding,
[4172] <prose> Gathering and various illusory displays,
[4173] <prose> Extending and withdrawing the limbs,
[4174] <prose> Demonstrating various activities:
[4175] <prose> With mindful consciousness taking hold,
[4176] <prose> The bodily conduct of the six realms—
[4177] <prose> Mind takes hold, the body performs.
[4178] <prose> Thus, whoever is able to conduct,
[4179] <prose> Through whatever is contemplated, later the continuum ceases.
[4180] <prose> For this, there are two types of purpose: || 4180 ||
[4181] <break> <prose> Examine through the division of common and supreme.
[4182] <break> <prose> Thus it is.
[4183] <prose> Moreover, through whatever is done here alone, in future times one will become enlightened right here,
[4184] <tantra> From the Great Array Chapter Thirty-Two:
[4185] <prose> Whoever desires to split open attachment,
[4186] <prose> Through reversing the body's activities,
[4187] <prose> Through whatever conduct is performed now,
[4188] <prose> Later it will not be thus—
[4189] <prose> Through that reversal, even for the body,
[4190] <prose> Without abiding, throughout the three realms, || 4190 ||
[4191] <prose> The body too does not enter.
[4192] <prose> Thus it is.
[4193] <prose> Moreover, at first when the body forms, speech and mind both depend upon it and form,
[4194] <prose> Therefore at first bodily conduct must be performed.
[4195] <prose> Through performing bodily conduct, later when bodily karma is exhausted, one lacks enthusiasm for activity, and there is the purpose of purifying bodily misdeeds.
[4196] <tantra> From the Ornament Wheel:
[4197] <prose> Whoever splits open the body's attachment,
[4198] <prose> By this, cyclic existence's habitual patterns are cultivated.
[4199] <prose> Thus it is.
[4200] <prose> Through splitting open bodily attachment for seven days, || 4200 ||
[4201] <prose> Or eleven,
[4202] <prose> Or half a month,
[4203] <prose> External bodily attachment self-reverses,
[4204] <prose> Internal body becomes endowed with peaceful discipline,
[4205] <prose> Secret illusory body is certainly liberated into clear light.
[4206] <prose> These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures.
[4207] <prose> These are gathered into what is called mind sections.
[4208] <prose> The sections of space gathered into three spaces:
[4209] <prose> Space of meditation without meditation,
[4210] <prose> Space of nature without searching, || 4210 ||
[4211] <prose> Space of no difference in characteristics—these three.
[4212] <break> <prose> These are gathered into three thousand named tantras.
[4213] <break> <prose> These are gathered into eleven thousand chapters.
[4214] <prose> These are gathered into twenty-two hundred thousand ślokas.
[4215] <prose> These are gathered into eight hundred thousand recitations.
[4216] <prose> These are gathered into two thousand distinctions.
[4217] <prose> These are gathered into nine hundred proclamations.
[4218] <prose> These are gathered into two thousand essential points.
[4219] <prose> These are gathered into fifty essence spheres.
[4220] <prose> These are gathered into fabricated liberation and || 4220 ||
[4221] <prose> posited liberation,
[4222] <prose> liberated-as-is—these three aspects gathered.
[4223] <prose> These are gathered into space sections.
[4224] <prose> All pith instruction sections are gathered into three spaces:
[4225] <prose> Space of play without cessation,
[4226] <prose> Space of mind without liberation,
[4227] <prose> Space of essence without good or bad.
[4228] <prose> These are gathered into twelve thousand two named tantras.
[4229] <prose> These are gathered into twenty-four thousand chapters.
[4230] <prose> These are gathered into twenty-one hundred thousand ślokas. || 4230 ||
[4231] <prose> These are gathered into eleven thousand recitations.
[4232] <prose> These are gathered into four thousand distinctions.
[4233] <prose> These are gathered into two thousand five hundred proclamations.
[4234] <break> <prose> These are gathered into eighty-seven essence spheres.
[4235] <break> <prose> These are gathered into three aspects: essential points gathered,
[4236] <prose> essential points seen,
[4237] <prose> essential points known.
[4238] <prose> These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures.
[4239] <prose> Though scriptures are many,
[4240] <prose> tantras, || 4240 ||
[4241] <prose> scriptures,
[4242] <prose> and pith instruction scriptures—these three gathered.
[4243] <prose> Though pith instruction scriptures are extremely many,
[4244] <prose> refutation,
[4245] <prose> accomplishment,
[4246] <prose> intention,
[4247] <prose> and recitation-focused scriptures—four gathered.
[4248] <ornament> Regarding recitation:
[4249] <prose> recitation of intentional-meaning pith instructions,
[4250] <prose> recitation of abiding-nature essence, || 4250 ||
[4251] <prose> recitation of philosophical system words,
[4252] <prose> recitation of non-dual saṃsāra-nirvāṇa—four gathered.
[4253] <prose> All of these are gathered into three: spreading essential points,
[4254] <prose> taming proclamations,
[4255] <prose> direct introduction,
[4256] <prose> and establishing directly in one's own essential point.
[4257] <prose> Gathering all of these, the great crucial general Dharma framework is well explained.
[4258] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[4259] <prose> The detailed classification of philosophical systems: the fourth chapter.
[4260] <prose> || 4260 ||
[4261] <prose> Thus having established the general framework of dharmas,
[4262] <prose> now explaining the unsurpassed vehicle in particular:
[4263] <prose> through the nature of tantra sections as knowables,
[4264] <prose> and the two determinations arising from that.
[4265] <break> <ornament> Regarding the nature of tantra sections, three aspects:
[4266] <prose> Brief showing of tantra framework,
[4267] <break> <prose> Detailed explanation of its nature,
[4268] <prose> Determination of explanation method branches.
[4269] <prose> The first has six aspects:
[4270] <tantra> Tantra essence, || 4270 ||
[4271] <prose> Definitive term,
[4272] <prose> Divisions,
[4273] <prose> Reading measure,
[4274] <prose> Example,
[4275] <prose> and Proof.
[4276] <prose> First, the essence of tantra:
[4277] <prose> Awareness and the ground establishing it—the great secret place unable to be added to or subtracted from, decisive.
[4278] <prose> Definitive term:
[4279] <prose> Showing family, — therefore tantra,
[4280] <prose> That which causes birth in whatever family, — therefore continuum. || 4280 ||
[4281] <prose> Decisive and unbroken continuity, — therefore tantra.
[4282] <prose> Divisions: nature-meaning tantra
[4283] <prose> and indicating-word tantra, two aspects.
[4284] <prose> Meaning tantra is:
[4285] <prose> Mind-itself luminosity by nature, free from conceptualization stains,
[4286] <prose> Abiding permanently in all, — therefore tantra,
[4287] <prose> Buddha family, — therefore tantra,
[4288] <prose> Possessing Buddha characteristics, — therefore posited as tantra.
[4289] <prose> Word tantra is:
[4290] <prose> That very thing indicated by name-word-letter nature, divided into chapters, etc., || 4290 ||
[4291] <prose> Generation stage primarily method,
[4292] <break> <prose> Perfection stage primarily wisdom,
[4293] <break> <prose> Both equally non-dual union,
[4294] <prose> Showing transcendence of all—Great Perfection essential point revealers.
[4295] <prose> Reading measure: generation stage chief, ten aspects:
[4296] <break> <prose> First, basis empowerment and samaya two,
[4297] <break> <prose> Deity and mantra two,
[4298] <prose> Mandala and offering two,
[4299] <prose> Concentration and conduct two,
[4300] <prose> Activity and view two, these ten complete, generation stage chief tantra. || 4300 ||
[4301] <prose> Perfection stage reading measure:
[4302] <prose> View and result two,
[4303] <prose> Conduct and meditation two,
[4304] <prose> Mind and wisdom two,
[4305] <prose> Experience and instruction two—these eight complete, perfection stage chief reading measure.
[4306] <prose> Non-dual union:
[4307] <prose> Both of these must be complete, eighteen.
[4308] <prose> Great Perfection complete:
[4309] <prose> Generation and perfection two, perfection stage,
[4310] <prose> Perfection stage: lesser elaboration showing channels-winds-bindus, || 4310 ||
[4311] <prose> Great showing clear light wisdom stage two,
[4312] <prose> Great: its reading measure, entering door, empowerment and samaya two,
[4313] <prose> Path and recitation two,
[4314] <prose> Result and five complete.
[4315] <prose> Example: like warp threads,
[4316] <prose> Depending on many cause threads, woven into cloth,
[4317] <prose> Depending on different words, revealing single meaning.
[4318] <prose> Proof: tantra abiding in oneself, showing indicator,
[4319] <prose> Therefore proven as tantra.
[4320] <prose> || 4320 ||
[4321] <prose> Moreover, depending on word-essential points, meaning-place without error decisively established, realizing, — therefore posited as tantra.
[4322] <prose> Second, detailed explanation of its nature, two aspects:
[4323] <prose> Detailed explanation of meaning tantra and word tantra.
[4324] <prose> The first, two aspects:
[4325] <prose> Method tantra
[4326] <break> <prose> and nature tantra.
[4327] <break> <ornament> First:
[4328] <prose> Awareness and pith instructions applying its meaning.
[4329] <prose> Divisions: indicated-method tantra
[4330] <prose> and indicating-method tantra, two aspects. || 4330 ||
[4331] <prose> First, essence:
[4332] <prose> Awareness pervading all beings, bodhicitta.
[4333] <prose> Definitive term: that very thing, indicated-meaning and realization-basis and liberation-method,
[4334] <prose> Therefore called indicated-method tantra.
[4335] <prose> Divisions:
[4336] <prose> emptiness
[4337] <prose> and clarity, two aspects.
[4338] <prose> Emptiness: awareness-essence empty of thing and mark dharmas in all, free from elaboration extremes, primordially abiding.
[4339] <prose> Clarity:
[4340] <break> <prose> || 4340 ||
[4341] <break> <prose> That clarity, not entirely empty, self-light five wisdoms' clear appearance,
[4342] <prose> Warmth and coolness and lightness,
[4343] <prose> Vast nature chief five elements primordially spontaneously complete,
[4344] <prose> Compassion's resonance unceasingly arising, awareness primordially pervading.
[4345] <prose> Moreover, awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings,
[4346] <prose> Called indicated-method tantra.
[4347] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[4348] <prose> All Buddhas' method tantra,
[4349] <prose> single ground essence distinction,
[4350] <prose> Indicated and indicating. || 4350 ||
[4351] <prose> Indicated tantra single pervader,
[4352] <prose> All connected as its following.
[4353] <prose> Pervasion has two aspects:
[4354] <prose> Emptiness pervasion and clarity pervasion.
[4355] <prose> Emptiness single cause without thing,
[4356] <prose> Transcending all things' dharmas.
[4357] <prose> Actual non-appearance single pervader,
[4358] <prose> All become basis single essence.
[4359] <prose> Pervader itself gathering.
[4360] <prose> Unborn mindfulness exhausted by || 4360 ||
[4361] <prose> essence distinction.
[4362] <prose> Empty and appearing, appearing and empty.
[4363] <prose> Actual and non-actual both.
[4364] <prose> Exhausted, — therefore primordially empty abiding.
[4365] <prose> Free from causes and conditions, empty object.
[4366] <prose> Pervading vast non-actual essence empty.
[4367] <prose> Stainless and unmixed complete.
[4368] <prose> Without concept empty nature.
[4369] <prose> Emptiness pervading, — therefore tantra.
[4370] <prose> Clear, nature not ceased. || 4370 ||
[4371] <prose> Illuminating appearance and pervader.
[4372] <prose> Clear and warmth and coolness.
[4373] <prose> Vast and moving essence holder.
[4374] <prose> Pervasion and self-resonance self-clear.
[4375] <prose> Liberating ripening seed.
[4376] <tantra> From emptiness reverse, — therefore clarity pervades.
[4377] <prose> Sudden and self-liberation.
[4378] <prose> Self-arisen clarity connected with body.
[4379] <prose> Stainless and individually clear.
[4380] <prose> Without grasping clear object appearing. || 4380 ||
[4381] <prose>
[4382] <prose> Looking far with clarity pervasion,
[4383] <prose> Binding the clear expanse of space.
[4384] <prose> Not cut off, pervading sphere.
[4385] <prose> Pervading essential points essential.
[4386] <prose> Signs of seeing completely liberated.
[4387] <break> <prose> Moving and pervading essential points.
[4388] <break> <prose> Spheres connected with body.
[4389] <prose> Pervading signs pervading essential points.
[4390] <prose> Reversing through pervasion. || 4390 ||
[4391] <prose> Here, seeing awareness like a chain,
[4392] <prose> Awareness' nature without good or bad, without change,
[4393] <prose> All from that state without other destination, — therefore called basis,
[4394] <prose> Other wandering impossible.
[4395] <prose> Moreover, awareness bound by wind essential point liberated sign,
[4396] <prose> Coming and going, existing,
[4397] <prose> Depending on bindu liberated sign, subtle bindu sphere existing,
[4398] <prose> Awareness depending on channel essential point liberated sign, chain subtle and curved connection existing.
[4399] <prose> These three, awareness not actual,
[4400] <prose> First instant distinction parted. || 4400 ||
