[11182] <prose><tantra> From that:
[11183] <prose> Effort-possessing person,
[11184] <prose> Body signs complete,
[11185] <prose> In bardo reality,
[11186] <prose> See truth, Buddha.

[11191] <prose> This between two births || 10 ||
[11192] <prose> Of life formation,
[11193] <prose> Like shooting star in sky,
[11194] <prose> In three instants as shooting way,
[11195] <prose> With emanation also,
[11196] <prose> Self-dissolves into essence.
[11197] <prose> If body, speech, mind signs gather,
[11198] <prose> This great bodhicitta,
[11199] <prose> Compassion possessing beings' holder,
[11200] <prose> This for holding beings,
[11201] <prose> In hundred thousand million years, || 20 ||
[11202] <prose> Even with one human body,
[11203] <prose> Completing this meaning,
[11204] <prose> Not entering between two births,
[11205] <prose> Complete attainment.
[11206] <prose> Also whoever fortunate,
[11207] <prose> Possessing body and mind signs,
[11208] <prose> Thus possessing, in ten years,
[11209] <prose> Dissolves elements to self-place,
[11210] <prose> Appearance not appearing,
[11211] <prose> Delivers to pure reality ground. || 30 ||
[11212] <prose> Who body, speech, mind signs,
[11213] <prose> Thus to fortunate person,
[11214] <prose> To whoever fortunate gathering,
[11215] <prose> Even in two years from this,
[11216] <prose> Dissolves this elements to self,
[11217] <prose> Without doubt this changes.
[11218] <prose>

[11231] <prose>  || 50 ||
[11232] <prose> 
[11233] <prose> Outer-inner certain signs exist as liberate measure thus. Liberate not pervaded by merely existing signs. Because liberate pervaded by existing signs, this special is important.
[11234] <prose><tantra> From Blazing Relics:
[11235] <prose> All body, speech, mind signs,
[11236] <prose> Some arisen person,
[11237] <prose> Not completely liberated—
[11238] <prose> Worldly common siddhi and
[11239] <prose> Gradually sravaka pratyekabuddha,
[11240] <prose> All these grounds,
[11241] <prose> This entered that ground, || 60 ||
[11242] <prose> Without pure great result.
[11243] <prose> Who possesses body, speech,
[11244] <prose> Signs complete person,
[11245] <prose> Even in equal great ground,
[11246] <prose> All these go, dakini.
[11247] <prose> Thus said signs only exist without certainty. Now without any outer-inner liberate signs, gone without meditation, action not harm, meditation not needed. Later do not place skull on head. Though saying view-meditation complete, seeing reality original meaning, know demon enters deceiving other and self both by sending lie.
[11248] <prose><tantra> From that:
[11249] <prose> Thus not possessing signs,
[11250] <prose> Entering confidence in own-appearance,
[11251] <prose> Who claims acceptance that, || 70 ||
[11252] <prose> Examination view and
[11253] <prose> Likewise examination meditation—

[11256] <prose> Long in saṃsāra,
[11257] <prose> This person also dwells.
[11258] <prose> That also: instruct with special diligence to leap-over meditation yogin because these signs arise without deception, certain liberation.
[11259] <prose><tantra> From that:
[11260] <prose> Therefore expanse-awareness familiar important.
[11261] <prose> Who familiar with expanse and awareness, || 80 ||
[11262] <prose> Those signs explained above,
[11263] <prose> Impossible to not arise.
[11264] <prose> Do diligence as well spoken.
[11265] <ornament> General meaning third: conclusion of signs certain of liberation and confusion in bardo and next life—two aspects.
[11266] <prose>

[11273] <prose> 
[11274] <prose> Signs of yogin liberating and obtaining enlightenment, and showing signs of six beings taking birth through confusion.
[11275] <prose> Of the first, two aspects:
[11276] <prose> Brief showing of signs,
[11277] <prose> Extensive explanation.
[11278] <ornament> Of the first:
[11279] <prose> Even meditating reality direct meaning, if diligence inferior, measure not reached. At time of separating solid-awareness with stone, signs of liberating from defilements without taking existence—complete buddhahood by great appearance of self-relics, sound, and light.
[11280] <prose> That also: Great Perfection's system has two Buddha ways—complete Buddha by appearing signs is nirvāṇa with remainder, stone with residue; perfectly complete Buddha by excellent diligence, pure stone with, is nirvāṇa without aggregates' remainder.
[11281] <prose><tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror Tantra: || 100 ||
[11282] <prose> nirvāṇa that also two:
[11283] <prose> Perfectly complete Buddha and
[11284] <prose> Complete Buddha.
[11285] <prose> Of that, perfectly complete Buddha is
[11286] <prose> Buddhahood without aggregates' remainder.
[11287] <prose> To complete Buddha person,
[11288] <prose> Light and
[11289] <prose> Sound and
[11290] <prose> Relics and
[11291] <prose> Kaya and || 110 ||
[11292] <prose> Earth move etcetera arise, said.
[11293] <prose><tantra> From Blazing Relics:
[11294] <prose> Excellent wisdom-power person,
[11295] <prose> Elements dissolve to self-place
[11296] <prose><tantra> From confusion appearance this,
[11297] <prose> To essence result,
[11298] <prose> Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11299] <prose> Result becomes self-ground.
[11300] <prose> Thus outer signs,
[11301] <prose> What from nirvāṇa, || 120 ||
[11302] <prose> To that kaya and relics and
[11303] <prose> Likewise light and sound and
[11304] <prose> Earth moves.
[11305] <prose> Second, extensive explanation—five:
[11306] <prose> Kaya, relics, light, sound, and earth move.
[11307] <prose> Of the first, essence, division, cause, place, and result.

[11317] <prose> 
[11318] <prose> Essence: appearing as deity forms—single kaya, half-kaya, father-mother, mass, great mandala; according to that direction, stupa, wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword, etcetera.
[11319] <prose><tantra> From not reaching creation-completion, letters, hand-symbols, half-kaya, self-single appear; from complete, father-mother, mass, mandala appear.
[11320] <prose> Division: peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya two.
