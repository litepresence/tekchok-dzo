[1096] <prose> These realms this field's peak Padma completely-arranged sky supporting abide.
[1097] <prose> These from immeasurable expanded,
[1098] <prose> Samādhi peaceful's own-light and bliss-joy engaging Sūraṅgama samādhi abiding.
[1099] <prose> That under mind completely-play wheel-possessing called sky, gold great vajra one upward arose,

[1101] <prose> Seeing vajra, beautifully seeing that, Sūraṅgama samādhi called.
[1102] <prose> That time emanation vajra that mind extremely moved,
[1103] <tantra> From those realms' nature arisen realm that to,
[1104] <prose> Some drop-like surpassing cast,
[1105] <prose> Upper Sūraṅgama samādhi from lapsed,
[1106] <verse> "What also not" said from:
[1107] <tantra> From above only perception exists,
[1108] <tantra> From that dwelling without any other,
[1109] <prose> Immeasurable beings expand, also called "nothing at all,"
[1110] <prose> Also called "slightly nothing." || 1110 ||
[1111] <prose> That good appearance of concentration is:
[1112] <prose> Must arise from good concentration,
[1113] <prose> Going increasingly bad below, emanation body arisen from that appearance, body size smaller than above,
[1114] <prose> Light brilliance also small, labeled as sound denying low called "nothing at all,"
[1115] <prose> Called ayatana by arisen and increased from above appearance,
[1116] <prose> Afflictions not manifestly moving,
[1117] <prose> Dwell in subtle latency.
[1118] <prose> These dwell in concentration called jewel box.
[1119] <prose> This like noble tenet arrangement from common vehicle,
[1120] <prose> When connected with beings expanding from mind entering existence beings, || 1120 ||
[1121] <prose> Now also beings' adventitious confusion arises from moving that unproven space awareness,
[1122] <tantra> From Secret Essence:
[1123] <prose> E ma ho from Sugata heart,
[1124] <prose> Self thought karma emanation.
[1125] <prose> Called,
[1126] <tantra> From Condense:
[1127] <prose> When conditions gather, karma confusion wheel arises.
[1128] <prose> Called.
[1129] <prose> This like beings new birth,
[1130] <prose> Not new born, || 1130 ||
[1131] <prose> Obscuration is together born ignorance equal endow to awareness, to that space part.
[1132] <prose> Not confusion later, first pure, only made actually clear by adventitious condition.
[1133] <prose> Cause expressing elements sound called space.
[1134] <prose> Then below thirty-thousand leagues,
[1135] <prose> To sky called mind activity various play,
[1136] <prose> Exist self-arising sound of immeasurable extending wheels meeting one to one.
[1137] <prose> There those above beings from gone to one direction calm abiding concentration,
[1138] <prose> Fall some below,
[1139] <prose> Only consciousness one to one.
[1140] <prose> Those beings expand greatly, || 1140 ||
[1141] <prose> Consciousness without end,
[1142] <prose> Form object,
[1143] <prose> Wheel enters,
[1144] <prose> Only conceive self to only consciousness, exceed end knowing,
[1145] <prose> Condense thing not exist.
[1146] <prose> Arisen from those, beings' form expands without end,
[1147] <prose> Called consciousness without end ayatana.
[1148] <prose> Those also from above life measure short,
[1149] <prose> Body size small, light not clear,
[1150] <prose> Low concentration, || 1150 ||
[1151] <prose> That also cause decline of merit power.
[1152] <prose> Below that at two thousand leagues,
[1153] <prose> To sky called great cloud various play,
[1154] <prose> Arisen to self-appearance concentration, pervaded by various colored cloud mass heaps,
[1155] <prose> Immeasurable beings expand from expanding consciousness.
[1156] <prose> Then called sky without end ayatana.
[1157] <prose> Thus from four formless,
[1158] <prose> Peak of existence lasts eighty thousand great eons.
[1159] <verse> "Nothing at all" sixty thousand great eons.
[1160] <verse> "Consciousness" forty thousand great eons. || 1160 ||
[1161] <verse> "Sky without end" lasts twenty thousand great eons.
[1162] <prose> If think body appearance contradicts formless, not contradict:
[1163] <prose> Meditation gods' appearance dwells only as consciousness by formless of light,
[1164] <prose> Desire gods humans' arise without flesh blood body, dwell not actually conceiving consciousness to object,
[1165] <prose> Pretas' move without mind form,
[1166] <prose> Consciousness clear inside,
[1167] <prose> Hells' experience without suffering body of contact,
[1168] <prose> That consciousness dwelling in concentration joy bliss state also,
[1169] <prose> Peak of merit share equal fruit, to concentration part four, self-nature emanation appearance body or form, not manifest to below, only see from self place and above.
[1170] <tantra> From middle Mother also, || 1170 ||
[1171] <prose> That time desire and form,
[1172] <prose> Formless dwell gods also holding flower in hand, worship Tathāgata.
[1173] <tantra> From short commentary also,
[1174] <prose> Established by called all god races come near.
[1175] <prose> Then manner of expanding to form realm:
[1176] <prose> When passed twenty-thousand leagues below from sky without end,
[1177] <prose> To sky called jewel ornament various arrangement, five lights clearly appear without outside inside, by becoming one expanding mass of above consciousness,
[1178] <prose> Immeasurable expand everywhere clearly possessing light mouth eye ear,
[1179] <prose> Do move fly hover etc. by wind power.
[1180] <prose> That also below compared to above formless, || 1180 ||
[1181] <prose> Above all desire form, exist above, not below, called "below not" or "below not," exist at peak of all form possess.
[1182] <prose> That also distinguish difference from limitless four ayatana concentration consciousness emanation body eye consciousness common not seen,
[1183] <prose> This like picture form or rainbow form, become outside light body to clear consciousness.
[1184] <prose> Body six thousand leagues,
[1185] <prose> Life lasts six thousand interval eons.
[1186] <prose> Understand those below sky interval, as before shown, by calculating what leagues exist from Jambu continent to below place.
[1187] <prose> When calculating below interval from "below not,"
[1188] <prose> To sky called variously ornamented by jewel deep blue,
[1189] <tantra> From fell some latency consciousness of above beings,
[1190] <prose> Immeasurable beings expand, || 1190 ||
[1191] <prose> Called "extremely see," cause exceed joy when one sees.
[1192] <prose> Body size eight thousand leagues,

[1205] <prose> Life lasts one interval eon,
[1206] <prose> Body size thousand leagues exist.
[1207] <prose> Those five place classes, without some affliction trace, called five pure class gods, five other noble places.
[1208] <prose> Above ordinary beings' three other places, below that to sky called jewel supreme beauty various spread, expand from fell some not great gods,
[1209] <prose> Called great fruit, cause establish from great virtue fruit of merit share equal.
[1210] <prose> Body size five hundred leagues, life lasts five hundred interval eons. || 1210 ||
[1211] <prose> Below that exists sky called variously ornamented by jewel kali beautiful color.
[1212] <prose> To those expanded from cut some great fruit gods in dot manner,
[1213] <prose> Called merit born, cause arisen from accumulated much merit before.
[1214] <prose> Body two hundred fifty leagues, life also that much interval eon.
[1215] <prose> Below that exists sky called jewel cloud various thick,
[1216] <prose> Immeasurable beings expand called cloud without light from cut merit born beings.
