[3354] <ornament> First, training capacity with two instructions:
[3355] <prose> The points of illusory body and clear light during daytime, and
[3356] <prose> Becoming familiar with the manner of bardo arising,
[3357] <prose> Mastery in dreams is the definite measure of liberation in bardo.
[3358] <prose> If that is also summarized in one point:
[3359] <prose> Do not especially abandon existence.
[3360] <prose> Do not especially establish non-existence. || 3360 ||
[3361] <prose> Do not attach obviously to existence.
[3362] <prose> Do not perform sad thinking toward non-existence.
[3363] <prose> Whatever grasping-thought toward doing, good-bad, appearance-manner, and—
[3364] <prose> Do not cut the trace of the past.
[3365] <prose> Do not welcome the before of the future.
[3366] <prose> Without depending upon present propensities with antidote in the continuum,
[3367] <prose> Neither stretched nor relaxed,
[3368] <prose> Neither puffed nor slumped,
[3369] <prose> Neither hesitant nor rushing—
[3370] <prose> Through practicing in traceless mind-touch appearance, || 3370 ||
[3371] <prose> Liberating appearance through appearance-moment.
[3372] <break> <prose> Liberating grasping of things.
[3373] <break> <prose> That also: liberating through appearance-moment.
[3374] <prose> Like a bird leaving no trace.
[3375] <prose> Liberating movement through movement-moment.
[3376] <prose> Self-dissolving without trace.
[3377] <prose> That also: like hail dissolving in space.
[3378] <prose> Liberating appearance and consciousness as non-dual.
[3379] <prose> Without outer-inner divisions.
[3380] <prose> That also: like water dissolving in water. || 3380 ||
[3381] <prose> Thus realizing, cutting latency attachment, and
[3382] <tantra> From Klongchenpa's Six Vastnesses:
[3383] <prose> Whatever person does not cut the trace of the past,
[3384] <prose> Does not raise hope for the future,
[3385] <prose> If placing present consciousness in its place,
[3386] <prose> Mixing without before-after distinction,
[3387] <prose> Called the essence of one-gathered, the yogi realizes the equality of three times.
[3388] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3389] <ornament> Second, the actual bardo instruction:
[3390] <prose> Earth, water, fire, wind, and space gradually dissolving, and || 3390 ||
[3391] <prose> When space dissolves into clear light,
[3392] <prose> Upward Ha and downward A gathering at the heart, bliss-clear without thought—clear light.
[3393] <prose> Increase, and
[3394] <prose> Attainment, and
[3395] <prose> Four wisdoms: near-attainment, moment one, and
[3396] <prose> Two and three and
[3397] <prose> Arising as four, and
[3398] <prose> Yogins familiar with clear light before recognize that, clear light mother-child mixing, and
[3399] <prose> In a moment, upward transparent in the primordially pure dharmakāya dharmadhātu.
[3400] <prose> For those not recognizing there, in the existence bardo, medium senses arise, deity illusory-body appears, liberated. || 3400 ||
[3401] <prose> Finally continuing the good, and
[3402] <prose> Certainty of liberation meeting supreme dharma in the future.
[3403] <tantra> From the Magical Net:
[3404] <prose> Though not obtaining liberation in this birth,
[3405] <prose> Obtain liberation in the existence of another birth.
[3406] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3407] <prose> Also in the common path, those with faith in that-ness are explained as liberated in the future.
[3408] <tantra> From the Four-Eight:
[3409] <prose> If knowing that here,
[3410] <prose> Though not obtaining nirvāṇa, || 3410 ||
[3411] <prose> Without effort in another birth,
[3412] <prose> Like law, certainty of obtaining becomes.
[3413] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3414] <prose> With elaboration of those, Mahāyāna samādhi explained complete.
[3415] <ornament> Third, from two Sugata intentions:
[3416] <prose> Briefly teaching is:
[3417] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[3418] <prose> Sugata intention is:
[3419] <prose> Know within the sky expanse.
[3420] <prose> Also become familiar with that. || 3420 ||
[3421] <prose> Spontaneously arise wisdom appearance.
[3422] <prose> Correct path also thus.
[3423] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3424] <prose> Extensively explaining is:
[3425] <prose> Upon the sun-moon union.
[3426] <prose> Two Sugata intentions:
[3427] <break> <verse> Sensations cease by unmodified placement.
[3428] <break> <verse> Obtain warmth measure by unmeditated looking.
[3429] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3430] <prose> That also: dharmatā mother appearance, without hope or fear of spreading or gathering, great samādhi without post-meditation boundary, river-continuum yoga without gaps. || 3430 ||
[3431] <prose> Is becoming one in space without end or middle, without distraction or non-distraction, sky-nature.
[3432] <prose> At this time called daytime-nighttime union meditation:
[3433] <prose> Daytime: the portion of transcendence.
[3434] <prose> Nighttime: the portion of saṃsāra.
[3435] <prose> By arising without distinguishing daytime-nighttime difference,
[3436] <prose> Daytime meditation: no cause for clear experience.
[3437] <prose> Gradually gone: nighttime unclear not exist.
[3438] <prose> Two meanings: that instruction, ocean relax method.
[3439] <prose> Call ocean the essence of eye-water.
[3440] <prose> Called ocean relax by placing that unmoved. || 3440 ||
[3441] <prose> That also: do not meditate, do not meditate.
[3442] <prose> The point is gazing without blinking eye beyond meditation.
[3443] <prose> By doing thus, like the ocean unstained though grasping-objects nonexistent, appear-objects exist, spread relax, all whatever appear, reflection, planet-ocean example.
[3444] <prose> Though appear appearance face, outer appearance arise measure yogi eye path.
[3445] <prose> By unstained, grasping-object nonexistent, consciousness not losing appearance moment.
[3446] <prose> Outer appearance not staining consciousness.
[3447] <prose> Inner consciousness not grasping appearance.
[3448] <prose> Called spontaneous meditation six-aggregate, liberating grasping-object grasping-nonexistent, cutting relating appearance consciousness.
[3449] <prose> This actual meditation, and
[3450] <tantra> From two: cutting error places. || 3450 ||
[3451] <prose> Actual: gathering wind-mind point, putting consciousness self-place, is.
[3452] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3453] <verse> Upon mind-settling called meditation,
[3454] <verse> Is cutting outer-inner movement.
[3455] <verse> Grasping and grasping cease.
[3456] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3457] <tantra> From Letter Nonexistent:

[3459] <prose> Mind unmodified appearance unchanged.
[3460] <prose> Show intention dwelling dharmatā sky. || 3460 ||
[3461] <prose> Abandoning all thought dharmakāya wisdom, and
[3462] <prose> Is meditation intention without doing.
[3463] <prose> If not holding focus direction,
[3464] <prose> Like planet arising in ocean,
[3465] <prose> Clear aspect without grasping not ceasing.
[3466] <prose> Intention dwelling manner thus.
[3467] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3468] <prose> Complete dharmatā relax intention that time.
[3469] <tantra> From Klongchenpa's Six Vastnesses:

[3474] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3475] <ornament> Second, cutting error places is:
[3476] <prose> If that also: going memory-non by ceasing six-aggregates.
[3477] <prose> Error place: going one direction shamatha.
[3478] <prose> Error place: going spread scattering.
[3479] <prose> Error place: not finding self-essence depth clear.
[3480] <prose> Error place: holding peg one-pointed. || 3480 ||
[3481] <prose> Know others from meditation: self-dwell without grasping, vast-liberated, self-clear awareness, briefly.
[3482] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3483] <verse> Is meditation dwelling head,
[3484] <verse> Upon clear all sense doors,
[3485] <verse> Mind thought unmoved,
[3486] <verse> Mind practicing itself consciousness,
[3487] <verse> Mind practicing outward,
[3488] <verse> Itself without existence loses outward.
[3489] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3490] <prose> That also: appearance not staining consciousness. || 3490 ||
[3491] <prose> Consciousness not practicing appearance.
[3492] <prose> Without peg-holding one-pointed, clear half-essence nature.
[3493] <prose> Is self-arisen wisdom meditation: pervading pervading great self-liberated, vast vast clear.
[3494] <tantra> From that source:
[3495] <verse> Is appearance-manner meditation characteristic,
[3496] <verse> Upon awareness empty-clear characteristic,
[3497] <verse> Not mixing where nature,
[3498] <verse> And ceasing extreme grasping-grasping,
[3499] <verse> Pure self-face dharmatā.
[3500] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 3500 ||
[3501] <ornament> Is fault of non-meditation incidental:
[3502] <tantra> From that source:
[3503] <verse> Is itself fault of non-meditation,
[3504] <verse> By manifest appearance saṃsāra characteristic,
[3505] <verse> Self other object consciousness, and

[3513] <verse> Become downfall with thought.
[3514] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[3515] <prose> Therefore, strive in meditation.
[3516] <ornament> Third is dharmatā aim of appearance-existence ground rising:
[3517] <prose> Whatever appears made path before, investigating appearance, establishing ground,
[3518] <prose> Through liberating self-relax, reaching elaboration limit occasion this.
[3519] <prose> Reason: able to dwell upon that unmoving, dwell-manner upon thing ground.
[3520] <tantra> From Klongchenpa's Six Vastnesses: || 3520 ||

[3535] <ornament> Fourth, that fruit:
[3536] <prose> Afflictions self-vanquished put by,
[3537] <prose> Afflictions self-pure part that wisdom dawning from,

[3574] <ornament> Third topic: yogin progressively doing view—four aspects:
[3575] <prose> View city continuum-cut,
[3576] <prose> Its instruction: mountain all-placement method,
[3577] <prose> Its aim: three realms complete liberation,
[3578] <break> <prose> Its fruit: afflictions ground-purified.
[3579] <break> <prose> First, two aspects:
[3580] <prose> General distinction of view, and || 3580 ||
[3581] <prose> Recognizing self-meaning.
[3582] <ornament> First, three aspects: nature, distinction, ground-juncture.
[3583] <prose> Nature of view:
[3584] <prose> Appearance-existence, container-content, primordially liberated-dwelling, thought-mind connected.
[3585] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3586] <verse> Nature of view: in container-content,

[3594] <prose> Distinctions: word-meaning view view, enumeration view, natural view—three.
[3595] <prose> From nature, distinction, ground-juncture three.
[3596] <prose> Nature of view is:
