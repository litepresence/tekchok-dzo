[11736] <list> The eighth: those of inferior grounds.
[11737] <list> Seeing and
[11738] <list> Reducing and
[11739] <list> Realizing accomplishment,
[11740] <list> The Śrāvaka grounds
[11741] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[11742] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[11743] <list> Stream-enterer,
[11744] <list> Once-returner,
[11745] <list> Non-returner, || 10 ||
[11746] <list> And Arhat grounds—four in all.
[11747] <prose> After death, if in six days it trembles in the south, it is the Bodhisattva ground.
[11748] <list> Perfect Joy,
[11749] <list> Stainless,
[11750] <list> Luminous,
[11751] <list> Radiant,
[11752] <list> Difficult to Cultivate,
[11753] <prose> མངོན་དུ་གྱུར་བ་དང༌།
[11754] <list> Gone Afar,
[11755] <list> Immovable, || 20 ||
[11756] <list> Excellent Wisdom,
[11757] <list> And Dharma Cloud—the ten causal grounds.
[11758] <list> Universal Light, the resultant ground—eleven in all.
[11759] <prose> After death, if in nine days it trembles from above with some sound, one obtains the Vidyādhara ground.
[11760] <list> Maturation ground,
[11761] <list> Power over life ground,
[11762] <list> Great Seal ground,
[11763] <list> And spontaneous accomplishment ground—four in all.
[11764] <prose> Moreover, since these persons do not swiftly attain the result, having first obtained their respective grounds, they must dwell for long periods training to bring them to perfection—thus it is proclaimed:
[11765] <prose> རང་རང་གི་ས་དེ་དག་གི་དང་པོ་ཐོབ་ནས་ཡོངས་སུ་རྫོགས་པར་སྦྱོང་བའི་བར་ལ་ཡུན་རིང་དུ་གནས་པར་གསུངས་ཏེ། || 30 ||
[11766] <prose> From the Blazing Relics Tantra:
[11767] <prose><tantra> "When earth trembles at the time"
[11768] <prose><tantra> "A being separates from breath,"
[11769] <list> The Śrāvaka grounds
[11770] <prose><tantra> "Likewise, should it tremble in three days,"
[11771] <prose><tantra> "The self-same ground gives rise to motion—"
[11772] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[11773] <prose><tantra> "When in six days it comes to be,"
[11774] <prose><tantra> "This is the Bodhisattva ground,"
[11775] <prose><tantra> "Entering therein, O Ḍākinī." || 40 ||
[11776] <prose><tantra> "If in nine days it should come"
[11777] <prose><tantra> "That earth does tremble and transform,"
[11778] <prose><tantra> "This one has power to freely roam"
[11779] <prose><tantra> "The ground of the Vidyādhara."
[11780] <prose><tantra> "Yet to one endowed with trembling grounds"
[11781] <prose><tantra> "Buddhahood fruit does not appear;"
[11782] <prose><tantra> "Thus in grounds and paths alike"
[11783] <prose><tantra> "Long cultivation must one dwell."
[11784] <prose> So it is.
[11785] <prose> Moreover, those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicles path and stages only to the nature of causes. || 50 ||
[11786] <prose> དེང་སང་ཐོས་པ་ཆུང་བ་དག་རྒྱུ་མཚན་ཉིད་ཁོ་ནའི་ས་ལམ་གྱི་ས་ཐམས་ཅད་ལ་འཇལ་བ་ནི།
[11787] <prose> This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus.
[11788] <prose> ཐམས་ཅད་མཚོན་མི་ནུས་ཏེ།
[11789] <prose> Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.
[11790] <prose> རྐང་མགྱོགས་པ་དང༌།
[11791] <prose> བྱ་ལ་སོགས་པ་ཁུར་པོ་བས་ཡུན་རིང་པོ་ཞག་བྱེད་པ་ཆོད་ལ།
[11792] <prose> བུལ་ན་རིང་དུ་ཐོགས་པ་ཡོད་པས་མ་ངེས་པ་ལྟར།
[11793] <prose> Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.
[11794] <ornament> The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms confusion.
[11795] <prose> This has two aspects: the general arrangement and || 60 ||
[11796] <prose> the presentation of actual signs.
[11797] <ornament> First:
[11798] <prose> For all sentient beings there are
[11799] <prose> two paths to go,
[11800] <prose> two results—making four in all.
[11801] <prose> Without the intermediate state of dharmatā and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible.
[11802] <prose> སྲིད་པའི་བར་མ་དོ་གཉིས་མ་ཡིན་པས་ལམ་ཡོད་མི་སྲིད།
[11803] <prose> Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.
[11804] <prose> To proceed toward buddhahood, there are five paths:
[11805] <list> the path of accumulation, || 70 ||
[11806] <list> the path of application,
[11807] <list> the path of seeing,
[11808] <list> the path of meditation,
[11809] <list> and the path of completion.
[11810] <prose> The path of confusion leading to birth as a sentient being also has five continua:
[11811] <list> the path of dreams,
[11812] <list> the path of latent tendencies,
[11813] <list> the path of the limits of karma,
[11814] <list> the path of the uncertain confusion-mandala,
[11815] <list> and the path where cause and result are each uncertain. || 80 ||
[11816] <prose> Regarding results, the distinctive buddha-fruits are twofold:
[11817] <list> Manifest,
[11818] <prose> The results of birth as a sentient being are six: hell,
[11819] <list> hungry ghost,
[11820] <list> animal,
[11821] <list> human,
[11822] <list> god,
[11823] <list> and asura—beyond these, no destination exists.
[11824] <ornament> Second, regarding actual signs, from among six:
