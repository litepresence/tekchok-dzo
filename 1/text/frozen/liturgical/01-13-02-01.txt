[16274] <prose> First, the essence of the water lamp is this:
[16275] <prose> Through holding the parts of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, the power-support of the agent seeing pure appearance and deluded appearance is the clarity of light-essence, and the clarity relying on that is.
[16276] <tantra> From the tantra of the blazing jewel lamp of the beautiful gold flower:
[16277] <tantra> Of the far-casting water lamp.
[16278] <tantra> Through essence, both appearances gather.
[16279] <tantra> Because the agent-holding part has not ceased.
[16280] <tantra> Because through view, both parts are held. || 16280 ||
[16281] <tantra> Of the agreement view of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa.
[16282] <tantra> Thus.
[16283] <prose> Second, the definition is this:
[16284] <prose> The form-reflection of light-luminous clarity and deluded appearance, earth stone appearance, abide hold at far distant.
[16285] <prose> Through casting saṃsāra's deluded appearance with deluded-thought far, it is far.
[16286] <prose> If not realized, nirvāṇa also casts far, thus far.
[16287] <prose> When seeing self-appearance, through binding impure, to snare.
[16288] <prose> If not realized, through attachment to deluded-appearance, through binding self-awareness, also snare.
[16289] <prose> Similar with rope.
[16290] <prose> If examine rope also, like hair single one one bind benefit cannot do. || 16290 ||
[16291] <prose> If not examined, like collection bind agent established.
[16292] <prose> If examine deluded-appearance and deluded-hold two, although ground-emptiness essence-empty.
[16293] <prose> If not examined, like confusion self-awareness binding-agent appear.
[16294] <prose> From bound appear time, bound not exist and.
[16295] <prose> From liberated appear time, through binding-agent self-characterized not exist, liberation not exist.
[16296] <prose> From magical-illusion.
[16297] <prose> Through anyone also not-bound, bound not exist.
[16298] <prose> Bind-agent object exist not exist.
[16299] <prose> Bound not exist completely untie not exist.
[16300] <prose> Primordial spontaneously-complete Buddha-dharma. || 16300 ||
[16301] <prose> Through teach purpose, emanate various make.
[16302] <prose> Thus speak like.
[16303] <prose> Furthermore, into vast self-appearance not-enter, through binding also noose.
[16304] <prose> Through not exist attachment to appearance, through moisten make inward samadhi bliss, water called.
[16305] <prose> Through rely also to gather water's essence, water called.
[16306] <prose> To power-consciousness, form-appearance clear and.
[16307] <prose> Through light-appearance increase upward arise, lamp called.
[16308] <prose> Through not is produce base of space-awareness's appearance, mother called.
[16309] <prose> Through make also view's support base of essence-power form-possess, mother called.
[16310] <prose> Thus also from burning-lamp. || 16310 ||
[16311] <tantra> Definitive word this like-this.
[16312] <tantra> Through hold distance far continuum.
[16313] <tantra> Through hold form-as appear and.
[16314] <tantra> Gather color etc and.
[16315] <tantra> From distance far also awareness body.
[16316] <tantra> Through make see agent hold and.
[16317] <tantra> From saṃsāra thought side.
[16318] <tantra> Through throw distance outward, distance called.
[16319] <tantra> Likewise from also not-realize side.
[16320] <tantra> Through throw nirvāṇa, distance is. || 16320 ||
[16321] <tantra> Likewise from saṃsāra's appearance aspect.
[16322] <tantra> Form and desire-object five.
[16323] <tantra> Through this by bind, noose is.
[16324] <tantra> To power-of appearance, appearance-of.
[16325] <tantra> Through this by hold, memory thought self-as.
[16326] <tantra> From distance hold, noose called.
[16327] <tantra> Likewise to sky cloud free.
[16328] <tantra> As awareness selfless body appear.
[16329] <tantra> Into appearance vast not-enter.
[16330] <tantra> Through this by hold, noose called. || 16330 ||
[16331] <tantra> To water appearance those.
[16332] <tantra> And return self-place attachment.
[16333] <tantra> Not exist all to attachment-of mind.
[16334] <tantra> Through set-by-means-of self-place appearance.
[16335] <tantra> Through free-by-means-of self-grasp, water called.
[16336] <tantra> All lamp self-of appearance.
[16337] <tantra> Through increase-by-means-of above from above.
[16338] <tantra> Through pristine-awareness clear-by-means-of lamp awareness.
[16339] <tantra> All element coarse-of appearance.
[16340] <tantra> And not-exist cease self-know experience. || 16340 ||
[16341] <tantra> Through clear-by-means-of power-of self-door lamp.
[16342] <tantra> Through set-by-means-of awareness outer-of space.
[16343] <tantra> And pure self-place inner space.
[16344] <tantra> Appearance.
[16345] <tantra> Through produce-by-means-of this-by-means-of experience-of appearance.
[16346] <tantra> Through mix-by-means-of space-race, also is mother.
[16347] <tantra> Also power all-of essence.
[16348] <tantra> Through is eye, arise make door.
[16349] <tantra> Mother called, all-of base hold.
[16350] <tantra> Thus. || 16350 ||
[16351] <prose> Three divide if three.
[16352] <prose> From wind-of essence root ram-horn like, element gather-of distant-noose water-lamp.
[16353] <prose> Light-root essence pristine-awareness-of color hold, pristine-awareness gather-of distant-noose water-lamp.
