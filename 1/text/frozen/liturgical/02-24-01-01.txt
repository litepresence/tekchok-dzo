[15275] <prose> Those of final faculties—beings most refined—or those lesser who yet failed to recognize truth when dharma-nature bardo arose before them:
[15276] <prose> When the path appears within the becoming bardo, dreamlike,
[15277] <prose> Recognition dawns: "I have died."
[15278] <prose> Remembering their wavering in that bardo state,
[15279] <prose> They recall the guru and instructions received—
[15280] <prose> Resolving, "Now I go unto the field of natural emanation"—
[15281] <prose> Through blessing of dharma-nature truth previously realized,
[15282] <prose> And through absence of self-grasping stain, propensities exhaust;
[15283] <prose> Miraculously born upon a lotus in that field in a moment, exhaling.
[15284] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Conjunction Tantra: || 10 ||
[15285] <verse> "By remembering the birthplace, those of final faculties exhale into the three natural emanation body fields."
[15286] <prose> Furthermore:
[15287] <verse> "O Teacher, Vajra Mind—
[15288] <prose> When those of final faculties behold this,
[15289] <prose> Does bardo itself appear,
[15290] <prose> The Teacher declares: It appears—
[15291] <verse> Self-grasping propensities exhausted,
[15292] <prose> Exhaled into natural emanation,
[15293] <prose> Without bardo, Buddha attained.
[15294] <prose> Thus it is said. || 20 ||
[15295] <prose> The preliminary instruction for this is:
[15296] <prose> Habituate daytime to direct perception of self-appearance;
[15297] <prose> At nighttime, habituate five lights within the heart, then sleep looking toward the emanation field.
[15298] <prose> Train power through transference during intervals.
[15299] <prose> When wisdom-consciousness riding wind projects from heart—or from eyes to chief heart-center—into emanation field through this crucial point,
[15300] <prose> You cut through bardo's dangerous precipice, transferring from one excellent dwelling to another, faultless.
[15301] <prose> At death's moment, when wind goes out ungathered, establish clear focus and project with HIG—
[15302] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Conjunction:
[15303] <verse> "Manner of entering pure fields:
[15304] <prose> Dwelling-transference, dwelling-entry— || 30 ||
[15305] <prose> Train consciousness riding wind.
[15306] <prose> That going above is precious;
[15307] <prose> Gathering, projecting awareness precious—
[15308] <prose> This is projection with HIG."
[15309] <prose> Thus.
[15310] <prose> Through practicing thus, some are born directly into the pure field itself.
[15311] <prose> Though path arises from hundred-path bardo, recognition of becoming bardo comes;
[15312] <prose> At that time, merely remembering that field, one is born through dharma-nature's blessing—
[15313] <prose> No hidden instruction exists.
[15314] <ornament> Regarding the manner of exhaling into natural emanation: || 40 ||
[15315] <verse> "Nature" has two aspects:
[15316] <break> <prose> The nature of abiding, and
[15317] <break> <prose> The nature of enumeration.
[15318] <prose> Abiding nature thus:
[15319] <tantra> From primordial time this abides as path-appearance;
[15320] <prose> Four directions of Sambhogakaya gate, spontaneous ground-appearance.
[15321] <prose> Though eleven exist—ten fields with great charnel-ground burning mountain at center—
[15322] <prose> Here five are recognized: great exhaling of liberation.
[15323] <prose> Enumeration nature:
[15324] <prose> By means of the ten perfections, one reaches the eleventh universal light ground—the special ground of Buddha-appearance. || 50 ||
[15325] <prose> Here one hears the Buddha's speech, — yet
[15326] <prose> The bodhisattvas are obscured by knowable obscurations and do not see the body;
[15327] <prose> When they see that body, knowable obscurations are exhausted and they are considered Buddhas.
[15328] <prose> This itself is also named the Dharma Body of accumulated merit.
[15329] <tantra> Therefore, from the Six Spheres Tantra:
[15330] <break> <verse> "The merit-accumulated Dharma Body
[15331] <break> <prose> And omniscient wisdom—
[15332] <prose> Similar, similar indeed, O treasure!"
[15333] <prose> Thus.
[15334] <verse> "Emanation" thus: || 60 ||
[15335] <prose> Four fields with center—five—emanation fields of five Buddha families.
[15336] <prose> Eastern field called Manifest Joy:

[15383] <prose> Earth, water, fire, wind arise, benefit and harm separated;
