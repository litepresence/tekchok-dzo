[9990] <ornament> First: The outer of the outer—abandoning falsehood.
[9991] <tantra> From the Wheel-Stacked Tantra:
[9992] <verse> Through the conduct of mantra inclination,
[9993] <verse> Even toward common beings of the migrating world,
[9994] <verse> Speaking false words through self-desire,
[9995] <verse> Always taking joy in speaking thus,
[9996] <verse> The power of mantra recitation will not arise, and
[9997] <verse> What is spoken to others is not holy either.
[9998] <verse> Through degenerating one's own speech,
[9999] <verse> One becomes the tongue-drip of others in the migrating world. || 10 ||
[10000] <verse> In future times, in the body of a gadfly,
[10001] <verse> One will experience this in the northern direction.
[10002] <verse> After that, the sufferings of bad migrations,
[10003] <verse> Various aspects, one will experience.
[10004] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10005] <prose> The inner samaya of Speech's outer: not speaking slander.
[10006] <tantra> Again from that same source:
[10007] <verse> Whoever is a person entered into mantra,
[10008] <verse> Who speaks slander dividing others—
[10009] <verse> Dharma-speaking circles will not gather, and || 20 ||
[10010] <verse> What is done becomes wrong, and
[10011] <verse> What is not practiced also becomes an enemy, and
[10012] <verse> The body is struck with weapons, and
[10013] <verse> After death, a body with claws,
[10014] <verse> Then experiences the sequence of bad migrations.
[10015] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10016] <prose> The secret of the outer: abandoning harsh words toward others.
[10017] <tantra> Again from that same source:
[10018] <verse> One who always speaks words of harsh criticism,
[10019] <verse> Former karma and later signs, || 30 ||
[10020] <verse> Lacking love for the migrating world, even friends become hateful.
[10021] <verse> The words of Dharma also become sought.
[10022] <verse> After death, a body of great pride,
[10023] <verse> Then circles through the three bad migrations.
[10024] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10025] <prose> The three of Speech's inner are:
[10026] <list> Dharma speaking: outer,
[10027] <list> Accomplishing: inner,
[10028] <list> Meditating: secret.
[10029] <tantra> From the Tantra of Samaya Aspects Arranged: || 40 ||
[10030] <verse> One who dwells in discipline with mantra,
[10031] <verse> To Dharma speakers, Dharma accomplishers, and
[10032] <verse> Those instructed in the Dharma,
[10033] <verse> Grieving and bestowing blame, and
[10034] <verse> Speaking words of scolding and disparagement—
[10035] <verse> Others' inclinations degenerate, and
[10036] <verse> Self-possessions degenerate, and
[10037] <verse> Self-dharmas become forgotten, confused.
[10038] <verse> Mind-thoughts become different, uneven.
[10039] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 50 ||
[10040] <prose> The three of the secret are:
[10041] <list> Outer: disparaging the vajra siblings,
[10042] <list> Inner: the guru's mudra and near circle,
[10043] <list> Secret: disparaging the guru.
[10044] <tantra> From the Tantra of the Two-Joined Mudra:
[10045] <verse> To vajra brothers and sisters,
[10046] <verse> If one speaks words cutting speech—
[10047] <verse> For a hundred aeons into millions,
[10048] <verse> Unbearable indeed is the suffering of bad migrations,
[10049] <verse> Experienced by this person, and || 60 ||
[10050] <verse> Former un-done and present signs,
[10051] <verse> Sequence becomes experience.
[10052] <verse> Former done in this life,
[10053] <verse> From middle to last experience,
[10054] <verse> Again in earlier former lives,
[10055] <verse> The end of karma done in this.
[10056] <verse> Life's measure, speech's karma,
[10057] <verse> Circles and others' tongue-drip, and
[10058] <break> <verse> Sudden speech, stream of speaking, stops.
[10059] <break> <verse> The guru's son and wife, and || 70 ||
[10060] <verse> What near-dwellers also suffice—
[10061] <verse> If one exceeds command and samaya,
[10062] <verse> From former karma becomes two-times,
[10063] <verse> Or through the guru's distinction,
[10064] <verse> Root and branch,
[10065] <verse> Speech exceeding speech is spoken, and
[10066] <verse> If exaggeration-blame, desire-words are spoken,
[10067] <verse> From former karma becomes a thousand-times,
[10068] <verse> Ripening-aspect unbearable,
[10069] <verse> Sequence through guru's distinction also, || 80 ||
[10070] <verse> Immediately becomes experience.
[10071] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10072] <tantra> From the Great Arrangement also:
[10073] <verse> To the guru and near circle,
[10074] <verse> To vajra siblings and sisters,
[10075] <verse> Even a trace of badly-spoken words,
[10076] <verse> In signs or actuality, do not speak.
[10077] <verse> Even if this arises in dreams,
[10078] <verse> If it arises, confess with the mind.
[10079] <verse> Actual and harsh done, and || 90 ||
[10080] <verse> If mindfulness is not seized,
[10081] <verse> Even if overturned, if not confessed,
[10082] <verse> Looking downward, one goes to hell.
[10083] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10084] <prose> Thus the samaya of Speech, divided, is nine.
[10085] <ornament> Third: The samaya of Mind, from outer, inner, and secret.
