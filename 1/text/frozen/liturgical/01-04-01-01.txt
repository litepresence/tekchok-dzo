[1902] <prose> Thus do the proponents of errant vehicles assert their positions.
[1903] <prose> They maintain three hundred sixty views regarding perishable collections of phenomena.
[1904] <prose> These may be subsumed under two principal categories.
[1905] <prose> The first demonstrates the general nature of eternalist and nihilist positions.
[1906] <prose> The second elucidates their specific varieties in detail.
[1907] <prose> The first category comprises two divisions.
[1908] <prose> Views asserting eternalism.
[1909] <prose> And views asserting nihilism.
[1910] <prose> Although proponents of non-Buddhist systems maintain diverse positions, || 1910 ||
[1911] <prose> The Samkhya school, which propounds permanent causation, constitutes their foundational doctrinal source.
[1912] <prose> Therefore, their position shall be explained first.
[1913] <prose> Dust, darkness, and energy constitute the three constituents.
[1914] <prose> The essence of these three in equipoise is designated as the self.
[1915] <prose> This self abides within the hearts of all sentient beings in a form proportionate to their physical size.
[1916] <prose> Within larger beings, it manifests as the size of a thumb.
[1917] <prose> Within smaller beings, it manifests as the size of a pea or sesame seed.
[1918] <prose> Within yet smaller beings, it manifests as merely a sesame seed fragment.
[1919] <prose> This self possesses the characteristic of whiteness.
[1920] <prose> It possesses the characteristic of oiliness. || 1920 ||
[1921] <prose> It possesses the characteristic of coiledness.
[1922] <prose> It cannot be destroyed or annihilated.
[1923] <prose> It remains invisible and hidden from ordinary perception.
[1924] <prose> Presently, dust, darkness, and energy constitute the three poisons of desire, hatred, and delusion.
[1925] <prose> When these three are in equipoise,
[1926] <prose> The self knows its own nature through self-cognition.
[1927] <prose> Its nature is invisible to external observation.
[1928] <prose> When liberation is subsequently attained,
[1929] <prose> One perceives liberation in the form of a white parasol encircling the celestial realms.
[1930] <prose> Presently, the self remains without movement. || 1930 ||
[1931] <prose> It is devoid of action and agent.
[1932] <prose> It is subtle through its cognition of objects.
[1933] <prose> It exists eternally throughout all time.
[1934] <prose> Through not knowing this nature, one wanders in cyclic existence.
[1935] <prose> Knowing this and not being distracted from its nature brings liberation, and through proper practice of offerings and virtuous conduct in this life, one will be reborn in the realm of the sovereign Ishvara with perfect retinue and enjoyments.
[1936] <tantra> From this root position, numerous sub-schools have branched forth according to their respective traditions.
[1937] <tantra> As it is stated in the Aryadeva's Compendium:
[1938] <break> <tantra> The self, not an agent, possessing no qualities,
[1939] <break> <tantra> Is posited by the Samkhyas.
[1940] <tantra> Relying on subtle distinctions thereof, || 1940 ||
[1941] <tantra> Their traditions diverge.
[1942] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[1943] <prose> Those who propound nihilism are the Charvakas.
[1944] <prose> These are the proponents of the position that nihilism obtains.
[1945] <prose> They maintain that from the mere appearances of this life's perceptions and experiences of pleasure and pain,
[1946] <prose> There exists neither former nor future lives.
[1947] <prose> There exists neither karma nor cause and effect.
[1948] <prose> There exists no liberation, no freedom, and nothing whatsoever beyond this life.
[1949] <prose> Among these, there are two types: those who propound causal nihilism and those who propound resultant nihilism.
[1950] <prose> The first are those who propound causal nihilism. || 1950 ||
[1951] <prose> Certain individuals such as the naked ascetics, the followers of Jnanagarbha, and others maintain that previous moments of consciousness differ from present moments.
[1952] <prose> Because consciousness exists naturally within the four elements,
[1953] <prose> It is compressed and unmanifest within the expanding elements themselves.
[1954] <prose> When conditions of heat and moisture are encountered, the naturally abiding consciousness within arises.
[1955] <prose> A new consciousness enters a new body.
[1956] <prose> Thus sentient beings are established.
[1957] <prose> Because consciousness naturally abides within earth, it causes the growth of crops, forests, and vegetation.
[1958] <prose> Because it abides within water, there is moisture, movement, and the production of sound.
[1959] <prose> Because it abides within fire, there is burning and incineration.
[1960] <prose> Because it abides within wind, there arises motion and movement. || 1960 ||
[1961] <prose> Therefore, wood and
[1962] <prose> stones and
[1963] <prose> all coarse objects possess consciousness.
[1964] <prose> When they strike one another, sound emerges.
[1965] <prose> When thrown, they move.
[1966] <prose> Certain trees at night cause their leaves to close and by day expand.
[1967] <prose> When bark is stripped, they wither.
[1968] <prose> They regenerate through moisture.
[1969] <prose> If sentient beings possessed karma and consciousness from previous lives,
[1970] <prose> Then wood and other objects would likewise possess previous lives. || 1970 ||
[1971] <prose> However, they do not, for they are adventitious.
[1972] <prose> They arise from the mere aggregation and combination of present elements, like bursting leather pouches.
[1973] <prose> How is this demonstrated?
[1974] <prose> Through the summer heat and moisture, the ear-base of horses, cows, and donkeys swells and distends.
[1975] <prose> Those parts that do not swell remain at the tail.
[1976] <prose> Ants and
[1977] <prose> insects transform into bees.
[1978] <prose> Frogs become fish, thus demonstrating this principle.
[1979] <prose> Therefore, cause is not permanent.
[1980] <prose> In summer, wooden sticks, stones, and rice grains within ant nests transform into sentient beings. || 1980 ||
[1981] <prose> Therefore, through the adventitious aggregation of adventitious causes and conditions, the result of sentient beings is established.
[1982] <prose> Moreover, this result becomes refined through superior causes and conditions.
[1983] <prose> Just as beautiful daughters born from refined queens demonstrate this principle.
[1984] <prose> This concludes the position of those who propound causal nihilism.
[1985] <prose> Those who propound resultant nihilism include followers of Katyayana, Ajita Keshakambala, and others.
[1986] <prose> These maintain that present sentient beings possess no previous lives whatsoever.
[1987] <prose> Moreover, the consciousness that arises from the naturally abiding cause within the elements does not exist.
[1988] <prose> All arises from intrinsic nature alone.
[1989] <prose> No one establishes the cause for thorns becoming sharp.
[1990] <prose> Sharpness arises spontaneously from distance. || 1990 ||
[1991] <prose> The sun rises and illuminates.
[1992] <prose> Water flows downward.
[1993] <prose> These phenomena occur without cause yet arise spontaneously through intrinsic nature.
[1994] <prose> Death occurs without remainder, thus future results are utterly nonexistent.
[1995] <tantra> As stated in the Kalaparajna Tantra:
[1996] <tantra> As the sun rises and rivers flow downward,
[1997] <tantra> As round seeds and sharp thorns exist,
[1998] <tantra> As peacock feathers possess supreme beauty,
[1999] <tantra> As king's sons appear beautiful,
[2000] <tantra> All these arise through intrinsic nature without maker. || 2000 ||
[2001] <tantra> Annihilation possesses no substantial existence, future lives do not exist.
[2002] <tantra> All this is mere conceptual imputation, adventitious delusion.
[2003] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2004] <prose> When it is objected that such doctrinal exposition becomes meaningless,
[2005] <prose> They respond in the following manner.
[2006] <prose> The proponents of causal nihilism state:
[2007] <prose> Although previous consciousness does not exist, present elemental consciousness exists.
[2008] <prose> When sentient beings mature through this, becoming habituated to the nature of nonexistence,
[2009] <prose> At death, the elemental dispositions within earth, water, fire, and wind disperse without consciousness entering, thus achieving liberation, and the doctrinal exposition has meaning.
[2010] <prose> If one is not habituated to nonexistence, at death the four elements of the body dissolve into external elements. || 2010 ||
[2011] <prose> This consciousness also divides into four parts and becomes annihilated in the nature of afflictions.
[2012] <prose> The proponents of resultant nihilism state:
[2013] <prose> Knowing the nature of nonexistence, other doctrines cannot steal this understanding away.
[2014] <prose> Toiling for meaningless purposes, we teach the doctrine of nonexistence in this life to turn people away from such futility.
[2015] <prose> Thus the doctrinal exposition has meaning.
[2016] <prose> These two positions are held by followers of Katyayana and others.
[2017] <prose> All sentient beings first arise from the elemental expanse.
[2018] <prose> During the intermediate period, they abide within the elemental expanse.
[2019] <prose> Finally, they dissolve into the elemental expanse and become utterly nonexistent.
[2020] <prose> They maintain that the elemental expanse alone constitutes the self of all beings. || 2020 ||
[2021] <prose> When abiding in the expanse, the nine non-abidings abide, appearing to all cognition.
[2022] <prose> When arising from the elemental expanse, the nine non-arisings arise.
[2023] <prose> External forms of various colors and
[2024] <prose> internal sentient beings, mental conceptions, and
[2025] <prose> diverse physical bodies arise as the nine non-becomings.
[2026] <prose> At liberation,
[2027] <prose> The nine non-liberations are liberated, thus all container and contained worlds self-dissolve, and without non-liberation,
[2028] <prose> Dissolved beings cannot return to the three realms.
[2029] <prose> Therefore, all sentient beings first arise adventitiously from the expanse,
[2030] <prose> Presently abide adventitiously within the expanse, || 2030 ||
[2031] <prose> And finally dissolve adventitiously into the expanse without returning.
[2032] <prose> The second section provides detailed explanation of the sixty branches.
[2033] <tantra> As stated in the Self-Arising Awareness:
[2034] <tantra> The errant vehicles maintain these positions:
[2035] <tantra> Three hundred sixty views of perishable collections.
[2036] <tantra> Three hundred are explained regarding the expanse.
[2037] <tantra> The sixty views are as follows:
[2038] <tantra> The Samkhya proponents of wrong views,

[2059] <tantra> The proponents of conduct-based permanence,

[2074] <tantra> Those who propound causeless nihilism,
[2075] <tantra> Those who propound utterly-annihilated emptiness,
[2076] <tantra> Those who view both cause and result as annihilated,
[2077] <tantra> Those who view path as annihilated and wisdom as annihilated,
[2078] <tantra> Those who propound great eternal nihilism,
[2079] <tantra> Those who propound path-annihilated certain-result nihilism,
[2080] <tantra> Those who propound nihilism through wrong mind, || 2080 ||
[2081] <tantra> Those who propound great emptiness nihilism.

[2084] <tantra> The extremists of apparent mind,
[2085] <tantra> The extremists who hold deluded appearances,
[2086] <tantra> The extremists who generate hatred,
[2087] <tantra> The extremists of mental action,
[2088] <tantra> The extremists of meaningless holding,

[2100] <tantra> The Dhushaka proponents. || 2100 ||
[2101] <tantra> Thus it is stated.
[2102] <prose> The detailed explanation of their meaning comprises two sections.
[2103] <prose> The explanation of the three hundred sixty wrong views of the expanse.
[2104] <prose> The detailed explanation of their sixty branches.
[2105] <prose> The first demonstrates that through delusion regarding the expanse of elements and consciousness, individual conceptual establishments of philosophical positions are made.
[2106] <prose> These are explained as three hundred through holding wrong positions regarding the three times.

[2206] <prose> Thus these hundred are enumerated.
[2207] <prose> Some among these propound eternalism.
[2208] <prose> Some propound nihilism.
[2209] <prose> Some propound both, — yet all are subsumed within eternalism and nihilism.
[2210] <tantra> As stated in the Self-Arising Awareness: || 2210 ||
[2211] <tantra> Briefly summarized:
[2212] <tantra> Eternalism and nihilism.
[2213] <tantra> The meaning of nihilistic views is as follows:
[2214] <tantra> Utterly annihilated extremist great emptiness,
[2215] <tantra> Continuously annihilated like empty space,
[2216] <tantra> Viewing annihilation as devoid of nature,
[2217] <tantra> Result-annihilated emptiness.
[2218] <tantra> Non-empty permanence without annihilation
[2219] <tantra> Is the philosophical position of the eternalist vehicle.
[2220] <tantra> Eternalism is eternal establishment. || 2220 ||
[2221] <tantra> Causal permanent entities are as follows:
[2222] <tantra> From the mandala of individual minds,
[2223] <tantra> Not arising from father's cause,
[2224] <tantra> Not depending on mother's condition,
[2225] <tantra> Large as large, merely a sesame seed,
[2226] <tantra> Small as small, merely a mustard seed,
[2227] <tantra> Smaller still, merely a hair-tip,
[2228] <tantra> Oily, coiled, white, and pure.
[2229] <tantra> Thus the nature of that cause,
[2230] <tantra> From primordial time immutable and permanent. || 2230 ||
[2231] <tantra> This aggregate of latencies and these aggregates,
[2232] <tantra> Abiding inseparably as one,
[2233] <tantra> Are posited as the philosophical position of causal permanence.
[2234] <tantra> Resultant permanence is as follows:
[2235] <tantra> Fortune or the great sovereign,
[2236] <tantra> Through revering and offering to the qualities,
[2237] <tantra> Although abandoning this first body,
[2238] <tantra> One causes rebirth in one's own ground.
[2239] <tantra> Made by fortune or great sovereignty,
[2240] <tantra> Thus they posit resultant permanence. || 2240 ||
[2241] <tantra> Eternalism and nihilism, two varieties,
[2242] <tantra> Each incongruent with their own meaning.
[2243] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2244] <prose> The second section provides detailed explanation of the sixty branches of these positions.
[2245] <tantra> Furthermore, from that same source:
[2246] <tantra> The Samkhya position is as follows:
[2247] <tantra> Dust, darkness, and energy are permanently cultivated.
[2248] <tantra> Delusion is posited as the foundation.
[2249] <tantra> Desire produces pleasure.
[2250] <tantra> Hatred is posited as repelling forces. || 2250 ||
[2251] <tantra> This constitutes the Samkhya doctrinal position.
[2252] <tantra> The Vaisesika view is as follows:
[2253] <tantra> They view external aggregates, elements, and sense-bases as subtle atoms.
[2254] <tantra> Moreover, first grasping holds atoms and counts subtle particles,
[2255] <tantra> This is the cause and condition of disintegration.
[2256] <tantra> This is the cause and condition of complete empty nothingness.
[2257] <tantra> When this body is abandoned, consciousness becomes space-latency.
[2258] <tantra> The body's elemental latency,
[2259] <tantra> Abides in the empty nothingness extreme.
[2260] <tantra> The Kumara philosophical position is as follows: || 2260 ||
[2261] <tantra> They posit mindless bodies.
[2262] <tantra> Consciousness does not exist in the body.
[2263] <tantra> Through mindlessness, when the body is abandoned, they posit complete empty nothingness.
[2264] <tantra> The Nirgrantha philosophical position is as follows:
[2265] <tantra> They view appearances as permanent conditionally,
[2266] <tantra> Yet view these appearances as impermanent ultimately.
[2267] <tantra> Future appearances are posited as permanent in fortune or sovereignty.
[2268] <tantra> The Nirgrantha intended doctrine is likewise.
[2269] <tantra> The Guhyapancaka teaching is as follows:
[2270] <tantra> Within the Buddha-emanated pure realm, individuals' lamps are kindled. || 2270 ||
[2271] <tantra> From the appearance of five wisdoms, Buddhahood is seen through subtle superknowledge.
[2272] <tantra> There are those who practice with five fires.
[2273] <tantra> They anoint sandalwood tree hollows with sesame oil,
[2274] <tantra> Ignite five fire piles, and burn their own bodies.
[2275] <tantra> Those called Tailapaka anoint their own bodies with sesame oil-soaked cloth,
[2276] <tantra> Wrap it around their bodies, ignite fire upon it, and burn themselves.
[2277] <tantra> There are those who practice the Trisula asceticism:
[2278] <tantra> Planting a three-pointed trident in the ground, they leap into its points.
[2279] <tantra> There are those who leap from cliffs or precipices to destroy their bodies.
[2280] <tantra> This is called the wrong partial-holding conduct. || 2280 ||
[2281] <tantra> From their own bodies, they extract flesh the size of palm-leaves from right and left shoulders and crown,
[2282] <tantra> Plant this body in an earth hollow,
[2283] <tantra> And have vultures devour their own bodies.
[2284] <tantra> Moreover, there are those called wrong animal-conduct practitioners.
[2285] <tantra> Entering dog-mode, they practice wrong asceticism.
[2286] <tantra> Those who propound action as cause are as follows:
[2287] <tantra> Just as skilled carpenters create male and female forms differently to perform actions,
[2288] <tantra> So too Dharma and so forth perform actions through their own superknowledge, thence to be born in fortune or sovereignty.
[2289] <tantra> The philosophical position of carrying action as path is as follows:
[2290] <tantra> Through performing household and other activities in this world, || 2290 ||
[2291] <tantra> Abandoning this body in future lives,
[2292] <tantra> Fortune or sovereignty escorts them to abide on Mount Meru's terraces.
[2293] <tantra> The view indicating permanent meaning is:
[2294] <tantra> Showing others' annihilation as utterly annihilated regarding one's own permanence.
[2295] <tantra> Those who propound eternal immutable permanence hold as follows:
[2296] <tantra> They posit permanent immutable great meaning as nature-uncertain.
[2297] <tantra> Those who propound conditional change are as follows:
[2298] <tantra> Viewing permanent meaning conditionally,
[2299] <tantra> Yet viewing annihilation ultimately.
[2300] <tantra> Those who propound causal permanence are: || 2300 ||
[2301] <tantra> In the center of one's own heart, the causal entity is round in shape,
[2302] <tantra> White in color,
[2303] <tantra> In size merely a sesame seed,
[2304] <tantra> Not arising from father's cause,
[2305] <tantra> Not produced by mother's condition, positing permanence.
[2306] <tantra> Those who posit resultant permanence are:
[2307] <tantra> Cause is impermanent, mind is non-substantial,
[2308] <tantra> Result is permanent, fortune or sovereignty exists, thus they speak.
[2309] <tantra> Those who depend on permanence for path are:
[2310] <tantra> Cause is impermanent, mind is non-substantial, || 2310 ||
[2311] <tantra> Result is impermanent, without assistance cannot reach fortune or sovereignty's ground,
[2312] <tantra> Path is permanent, abiding on Mount Meru above fortune or sovereignty's path,
[2313] <tantra> Thus they posit abiding in that path.
[2314] <tantra> Those who posit permanence in conduct are:
[2315] <tantra> Cause and result are impermanent, through permanent conduct liberation is posited.
[2316] <tantra> Villages and houses are permanent,
[2317] <tantra> All these appearances are viewed as permanent.
[2318] <tantra> Those who view nihilism regarding nonexistent permanent meaning are:
[2319] <tantra> Viewing annihilation of meaning,
[2320] <tantra> Yet practicing eternalist philosophical positions. || 2320 ||
[2321] <tantra> Making wrathful mantras primary, performing fierce destructive actions,
[2322] <tantra> Speaking of black single gatherings,
[2323] <tantra> Being attached thereto and desiring results.
[2324] <tantra> Those who make matrka and pra primary are:
[2325] <tantra> Depending solely on this world's pleasure,
[2326] <tantra> Saying future lives are utterly nonexistent.
[2327] <tantra> Those who make subtle magical powers primary are:
[2328] <tantra> In this world, magical powers can repel enemy armies,
[2329] <tantra> In future lives too, through magical powers suppressing and being born in fortune or sovereignty.
[2330] <tantra> The view of those who prioritize debate is as follows: || 2330 ||
[2331] <tantra> Establishing their own truth internally and refuting others externally, there are those who aspire to meaning.
[2332] <tantra> There are those who aspire to meaning through wrong asceticism.
[2333] <tantra> Those attached to this world are called Charvaka.
[2334] <tantra> They engage in activities of this world.
[2335] <tantra> There are those who, understanding their own truth, belittle others.
[2336] <tantra> There are those who seek meaning through custom.
[2337] <tantra> There are those who, making matted hair hats, seek meaning.
[2338] <tantra> There are those who, wrapping single cotton cloth around their bodies, say inner heat is produced.
[2339] <tantra> There are those who, holding khatvanga and damaru as hand-symbols, say I am an emanation body.
[2340] <tantra> Saying whatever virtue you perform benefits me, there are those who depend on that meaning. || 2340 ||
[2341] <tantra> Refuting others' reasoning through their own reasoning, saying it is my activity, there are those who speak thus depending on that meaning.
[2342] <tantra> There are those who say cause is annihilated, like space, utterly annihilated.
[2343] <tantra> There are those who say utter annihilation, one's own body too is empty.
[2344] <tantra> Cause too is annihilated, result too is annihilated:
[2345] <tantra> Cause is annihilated, mind cannot be grasped as substantial,
[2346] <tantra> Result is annihilated, fortune and sovereignty do not exist, thus they speak.
[2347] <tantra> Path too is annihilated, without warmth,
[2348] <tantra> Wisdom too is annihilated, no Buddhahood,
[2349] <tantra> Cause and result do not exist, merely empty utter annihilation, thus they speak.
[2350] <tantra> There are those who say path-abiding conditionally annihilated, result certainly annihilated. || 2350 ||
[2351] <tantra> With wrong mind killing life,
[2352] <tantra> Saying meaning arises from killing life.
[2353] <tantra> There are those who say annihilation emptiness: because you are annihilated and I am annihilated, — therefore empty and utterly nonexistent.
[2354] <tantra> Those who propound Veda as secret are:
[2355] <tantra> Meaning is like space, utterly annihilated emptiness,
[2356] <tantra> Existence is non-substantial,
[2357] <tantra> Something slightly exists,
[2358] <tantra> Appearing to sense faculties, thus they speak.
[2359] <tantra> Those called extremists deviating from partial similarity are:
[2360] <tantra> Deviating from Buddhists who resemble them, || 2360 ||
[2361] <tantra> Through wrong views of Buddhist philosophical positions, merely flesh.
[2362] <tantra> Those of apparent mind miracles, thinking all is miracle, thus teach.
[2363] <tantra> There are those who say these deluded appearances are true,
[2364] <tantra> Because ultimately there is no meaning.
[2365] <tantra> Generating hatred, subduing elemental spirits, there are those who say sons of good family should abide in hatred.
[2366] <break> <tantra> There are those who say this mind in form of self-arising Pratyekabuddhas cannot be altered.
[2367] <break> <tantra> There are those who say meditating solely on divine bodies is sufficient.
[2368] <tantra> Some, being extremist practitioners, deviate from extremist debate speech.
[2369] <tantra> There are those who say this alone is permanent, — therefore nothing need be done.
[2370] <tantra> Kanada is thus called, || 2370 ||
[2371] <tantra> Positing scattered meaning.
[2372] <tantra> Nirgrantha is thus called,
[2373] <tantra> Possessing suffering of doubt that appearance will be exhausted and emptied.
[2374] <tantra> Sambhari is thus called,
[2375] <tantra> Positing that neither specific meaning nor common meaning exists.
[2376] <tantra> Kashyapa is thus called,
[2377] <tantra> Positing that common meaning does not exist yet specific meaning exists.
[2378] <tantra> Sindhara is thus called,
[2379] <tantra> Positing that no meaning whatsoever exists.
[2380] <tantra> Dhasanga is thus called, || 2380 ||
[2381] <tantra> Positing that all meaning exists.
[2382] <tantra> Katyayana is thus called,
[2383] <tantra> Positing that all meaning exists until breath ceases, then annihilated.
[2384] <tantra> Sangha is thus called: entering as Sangha form is sufficient.
[2385] <tantra> There are those who say thus.
[2386] <tantra> Shankara is thus called,
[2387] <tantra> Impermanent truth.
[2388] <tantra> Conditioned impermanent truth is:
[2389] <tantra> Fortune or sovereignty truth.
[2390] <tantra> Dhushaka is thus called, || 2390 ||
[2391] <tantra> All meaning-source is subsumed in fortune and sovereignty.
[2392] <tantra> There are those who say fortune and sovereignty exist above Mount Meru.
[2393] <tantra> Likewise, innumerable views of perishable collections are subsumed in two root categories.
[2394] <tantra> These are eternalism and nihilism.
[2395] <tantra> From these, innumerable views of perishable collections proliferate.
[2396] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2397] <prose> All these teachings are subsumed in four categories.
[2398] <prose> Errant views, final errancy, Charvaka, and nihilism.
[2399] <prose> Errant views are thus called: those who propound eternal permanence.
[2400] <prose> Final errancy is: || 2400 ||
[2401] <prose> Propounding both eternal and impermanent, both eternalism and nihilism.
[2402] <prose> Charvaka posits half eternalism and half nihilism.
[2403] <prose> Nihilism is propounding utter annihilation.
[2404] <prose> This too is subsumed in eternalism and nihilism.
[2405] <tantra> From that same source:
[2406] <tantra> These and other wrong views
[2407] <tantra> Are explained as subsumed in four categories:
[2408] <tantra> Errant views, final errancy,
[2409] <tantra> Charvaka, and nihilism.
[2410] <tantra> Explanation of these is as follows: || 2410 ||
[2411] <tantra> Errant views are eternal permanence.
[2412] <tantra> Final errancy is half eternal half annihilated.
[2413] <tantra> Nihilists are utterly annihilated.
[2414] <tantra> Charvaka are result-annihilated.
[2415] <tantra> Thus the three hundred sixty
[2416] <tantra> Are subsumed in four categories.
[2417] <break> <tantra> These too are subsumed in eternalism and nihilism.
[2418] <break> <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2419] <prose> The purpose of teaching these is:
[2420] <prose> Through recognizing errant paths, one does not enter them. || 2420 ||
[2421] <tantra> From that same source:
[2422] <prose> Moreover, <tantra> Thus, sons of good family, because you might enter errant paths, I have subsumed and taught these many views of perishable collections.
[2423] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2424] <prose> Thus concludes the explanation of non-Buddhist philosophical positions.
[2425] <prose> The second section extensively differentiates the transcendent vehicles.
[2426] <prose> This comprises three parts:
[2427] <prose> The method surpassing non-Buddhists,
[2428] <prose> General demonstration of categories,
[2429] <prose> Detailed explanation of distinctions.
[2430] <prose> The first demonstrates transcendence through accepting the four seals of Dharma and taking refuge in the Three Jewels, which non-Buddhist paths lack. || 2430 ||
[2431] <prose> The four seals are: all conditioned phenomena are impermanent.
[2432] <prose> All contaminated phenomena are suffering.
[2433] <prose> All phenomena are empty and selfless.
[2434] <prose> nirvāṇa is peaceful.
[2435] <prose> The second comprises five aspects.
[2436] <prose> Essential nature.
[2437] <prose> Etymology.
[2438] <prose> Divisions.
[2439] <prose> Purpose.
[2440] <prose> Results. || 2440 ||
[2441] <prose> The essential nature of the transcendent vehicle is:
[2442] <break> <prose> Any Dharma category that serves as a supreme method for liberating from cyclic existence.
[2443] <break> <prose> The etymology is: that which when entered produces bliss and happiness.
[2444] <tantra> As stated in the Compendium:
[2445] <tantra> That which, when mounted, liberates all sentient beings from suffering,
[2446] <tantra> Produces joy, happiness, and bliss, supreme qualities,
[2447] <tantra> This vehicle is like space, a great immeasurable mansion.
[2448] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2449] <prose> Divisions:
[2450] <prose> Lesser and greater, or || 2450 ||
[2451] <break> <prose> Shravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva vehicles, or
[2452] <break> <prose> According to disciples' minds, inconceivable divisions exist.
[2453] <tantra> As stated in the Lankavatara Sutra:
[2454] <tantra> As long as minds engage,
[2455] <tantra> There is no limit to vehicles' extremes.
[2456] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2457] <prose> Purpose: there is purpose for accomplishing both temporary and ultimate goals.
[2458] <prose> Results: definite emergence from the three realms and attainment of liberation.
[2459] <prose> The third section provides detailed explanation of distinctions.
[2460] <tantra> From the Self-Arising Awareness: || 2460 ||
[2461] <tantra> The divisions of vehicles are as follows:
[2462] <tantra> Sutra, extensive great, and
[2463] <tantra> Extremely extensive great.
[2464] <tantra> Extremely extensive great is:
[2465] <tantra> Eighty-four thousand inconceivable,
[2466] <tantra> Extensive, numerous, and great,
[2467] <tantra> Inconceivable, immeasurable,
[2468] <tantra> Unspeakable, beyond thought, great.
[2469] <tantra> The great king is as follows:
[2470] <tantra> Divisions are posited as nine. || 2470 ||
[2471] <tantra> Shravaka, Pratyekabuddha,
[2472] <tantra> Likewise Bodhisattva.
[2473] <tantra> Kriya, Upa, and
[2474] <tantra> Likewise explained as Yoga vehicle.
[2475] <tantra> Mahayoga, Anuyoga,
[2476] <tantra> Likewise Atiyoga Great Perfection.
[2477] <tantra> Thus explained as nine divisions,
[2478] <tantra> This is the great Dharma teaching.
[2479] <tantra> The meaning of this declaration is established as follows.
[2480] <prose> Generally, although Buddha's Dharma categories are limitless, || 2480 ||
[2481] <prose> When subsumed merely as vehicles,
[2482] <prose> There are two: the Causal Characteristic Vehicle and
[2483] <prose> The Resultant Vajra Vehicle.
[2484] <prose> Explained extensively:
[2485] <prose> For three lesser faculties,
[2486] <prose> The Shravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva vehicles are taught.
[2487] <prose> For three intermediate faculties, Kriya, Upa, and Yoga are taught.
[2488] <prose> For three sharp faculties,
[2489] <prose> Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga are taught.
[2490] <tantra> From the Atiyoga Great Arrangement: || 2490 ||
[2491] <tantra> All teachings I have taught,
[2492] <tantra> According to sentient beings' mental stages,
[2493] <tantra> Through distinctions of great and small,
[2494] <tantra> Are taught through the method of two stages.
[2495] <tantra> Each is established according to its own view.
[2496] <tantra> Each itself comprises two stages:
[2497] <tantra> Wrong and correct views.
[2498] <tantra> Through wrong understanding one abides in cyclic existence.
[2499] <tantra> Correct understanding comprises three stages:
[2500] <tantra> Lesser mind, greater mind, and || 2500 ||
[2501] <break> <tantra> Likewise intermediate mind.
[2502] <break> <tantra> Through the method of three stages are taught.
[2503] <tantra> The lesser stage comprises three:
[2504] <tantra> Dharma concordant with father,
[2505] <tantra> Conceptual, Shravaka,
[2506] <tantra> Conception-holders, Pratyekabuddha,
[2507] <tantra> Conception-adherents, Bodhisattva.
[2508] <tantra> Taught to three intermediate ones:
[2509] <tantra> Activity for the supremely lesser,
[2510] <tantra> Activity for lesser ones. || 2510 ||
[2511] <tantra> Consciousness-holders, yoga itself,
[2512] <tantra> For great stage-possessing three.
[2513] <tantra> For vast-minded ones, generation stage,
[2514] <tantra> For mind-essence ones, completion stage.
[2515] <tantra> For supreme fresh ones, Great Perfection.
[2516] <tantra> Thus it is declared.
[2517] <prose> The extremely extensive great vehicle is:
[2518] <prose> All teachings are subsumed in the three baskets.
[2519] <prose> Mantras are the great Abhidharma.
[2520] <prose> Sutra, || 2520 ||
[2521] <prose> Vinaya, and
[2522] <prose> Abhidharma comprise the Great Vehicle.
[2523] <prose> All teachings are subsumed in the three baskets.
[2524] <prose> Mantras are the great Abhidharma.
[2525] <prose> Sutra,
[2526] <prose> Vinaya, and
[2527] <prose> Abhidharma.
[2528] <prose> These three equally comprise eighty-four thousand.
[2529] <prose> The Dharma skandhas are eighty-four thousand four thousand.
[2530] <prose> Moreover, analyzed extensively, for each antidote subduing sentient beings' conceptual aggregates, there are vast, numerous, inconceivable, immeasurable, beyond-speech teachings. || 2530 ||
[2531] <prose> Here, through positing nine vehicles,
[2532] <prose> The complete meaning is demonstrated.
[2533] <prose> Thus concludes the explanation of vehicles.
[2534] <prose> Vehicle distinctions are thus:
[2535] <prose> Sutra and great extensive,
[2536] <prose> And also very great extensive teachings exist,
[2537] <prose> Very great extensive is the doctrine,
[2538] <prose> Eighty-four thousand inconceivable dharma doors.
