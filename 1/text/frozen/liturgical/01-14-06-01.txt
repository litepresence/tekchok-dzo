[19303] <prose> First, regarding the outer Clear Light: the primordially pure dimension of spontaneous presence holds the Five Lights.
[19304] <prose> Within the crystalline sphere of self-arisen awareness abiding in the primordial ground, the union of sun and moon produces
[19305] <prose> Uncontrived wisdom, pure in its ground, beyond the realm of color—stainless white light dwelling in its own pure place, where appearance is undivided anywhere.
[19306] <prose> Unsought yellow light dwelling in its own pure place, where manifold objects do not appear as such.
[19307] <prose> Unattached red light dwelling in its own pure place, where consciousness does not appear as objects of knowledge.
[19308] <prose> Effortless green light dwelling in its own pure place, transcending all action and actor.
[19309] <prose> Immutable vast blue light dwelling in its own pure place, where awareness abides without establishing any essence whatsoever.
[19310] <prose> These very lights serve as both the arising ground and the dissolution place of appearances. || 19310 ||
[19311] <prose> This applies equally to the ground appearance of the primordial dimension,
[19312] <prose> To the path appearance of the present moment,
[19313] <prose> And to the self-appearance of the bardo—the Five Lights arise outwardly in this very life, and at the time of setting, whether in the present, the bardo, or the ground appearance, these five dissolve into their own dimensional space.
[19314] <prose> In brief, the inner body and wisdom that abide pure,
[19315] <prose> And the outer appearances of body and wisdom—these two serve as both the arising ground and the dissolution place of all appearances.
[19316] <prose> Second, regarding the Five Lights that hold color,
[19317] <prose> From self-arising,
[19318] <prose> Wisdom light arises.
[19319] <prose> Blue light arises, for wisdom is immutable.
[19320] <prose> White light arises, for wisdom is pure. || 19320 ||
[19321] <prose> Yellow light arises, for wisdom manifests qualities.
[19322] <prose> Red light arises, for wisdom holds complete power.
[19323] <prose> Green light arises, for wisdom fulfills enlightened activity.
[19324] <prose> All sentient beings likewise abide in this manner.
[19325] <prose> From the previous section,
[19326] <prose> The Five Lights of self-manifesting clarity that hold color are these:
[19327] <prose> White,
[19328] <prose> Yellow,
[19329] <prose> Red,
[19330] <prose> Green, || 19330 ||
[19331] <prose> And blue.
[19332] <prose> Fourth, regarding the three Bindus.
[19333] <prose> From the union of sun and moon come three Bindus:
[19334] <prose> The Bindu that holds the ground,
[19335] <prose> The Bindu of the appearance path,
[19336] <prose> And the Bindu of self-ripened result.
[19337] <prose> First, the heart-center holds the Five Lights of spontaneous presence as Bindus abiding within the essence of the clear light channels.
[19338] <prose> Appearing as the surrounding rim of the Five Lights, these are named the Bindu of Natural Light.
[19339] <prose> Adorned by primordially pure awareness, these are named the Bindu of Samantabhadra, the All-Good.
[19340] <prose> Regarding these, || 19340 ||
[19341] <prose> The two Bindus that hold the ground are the Bindu of Natural Light and the Bindu of Samantabhadra.
[19342] <prose> In the Guhyasamaja Tantra, this very essence is called the unbreakable Bindu.
[19343] <prose> In the Hevajra Tantra, it is named the immutable Bindu of great bliss,
[19344] <prose> Abiding perpetually within the heart,
[19345] <prose> This single Bindu is without change.
[19346] <prose> For those who meditate upon it,
[19347] <prose> Wisdom will certainly arise.
[19348] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[19349] <prose> Second, regarding the Bindus of the path, there are two.
[19350] <prose> From the union of sun and moon, || 19350 ||
[19351] <prose> The two Bindus of the appearance path are the relative causal Bindu and the ultimate abiding Bindu.
[19352] <prose> First, as extensively shown before, to explain briefly:
[19353] <prose> From this very source,
[19354] <prose> The relative causal Bindu abides within the channels of all embodied beings,
[19355] <prose> Appearing as father's cause and mother's condition.
[19356] <prose> The gathering of elemental essences becomes the red maternal Bindu.
[19357] <prose> The gathering of all Bodhicitta sediment becomes the white paternal Bindu.
[19358] <prose> Therefore, through the gathering of elements, form ripens.
[19359] <prose> Through the gathering of Bodhicitta, mindfulness, thought, feeling, and awareness coalesce.
[19360] <prose> This applies equally to miraculously born beings, || 19360 ||
[19361] <prose> To womb-born beings,
[19362] <prose> And to warmth-moisture-born beings—the gathering of elements serves as the seed.
[19363] <prose> The gathering of Bodhicitta as seed—these two seeds constitute the self-essence from which birth is taken.
[19364] <prose> Thus, in all embodied beings, the white and red Bindus that gather the body abide as self-constituents.
[19365] <prose> In males, the elemental seed gathers within its own scope and does not manifest visibly.
[19366] <prose> In females, the Bodhicitta seed abides unchanging in the ground and does not emerge visibly.
[19367] <prose> Therefore, those without seed can meditate upon bliss,
[19368] <prose> Yet even meditating upon Bindu and wind, they remain unliberated.
[19369] <prose> Thus, through these two seeds serving as the support for the aggregates,
[19370] <prose> These two also perform the life-conditioning of persons. || 19370 ||
[19371] <break> <prose> The elements temporarily condition self-awareness as enemy.
[19372] <break> <prose> When the elements are exhausted, these two abide and transfer.
[19373] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[19374] <prose> Furthermore, the Bindu of males and the elemental seeds are separate.
[19375] <prose> The seed serves as the support for the initial view of the channels,
[19376] <prose> Yet does not appear visibly.
[19377] <prose> In females, the pure elemental essence abides at the lower tip.
[19378] <prose> In the center of the wheel of the space-protector at the secret place, the form of AH abides without visible manifestation.
[19379] <prose> This serves as the support for the Bindu's actual flow.
[19380] <prose> These two perform the action. || 19380 ||
[19381] <prose> The seed of the Bindu is named the gathering of elemental essences.
[19382] <prose> Distinguishing the difference between these two is essential.
[19383] <prose> Second, regarding the ultimate abiding Bindu.
[19384] <prose> From the union of sun and moon,
[19385] <prose> The two ultimate abiding Bindus are the self-abiding causal Bindu and the Bindu arisen from masculine habituation.
[19386] <prose> The self-abiding causal Bindu is the gathering of light essence within the heart of all embodied beings,
[19387] <prose> Gathering the five-colored pellets like fish eyes,
[19388] <prose> Like the eyes of those sleeping within nests,
[19389] <prose> Like the mind-moving eyes of dakinis,
[19390] <prose> At times moving within and abiding within the channels. || 19390 ||
[19391] <prose> That arisen from masculine habituation
[19392] <prose> Is the Bindu dwelling in the right channel's upper tip at the crown, the pure essence of HAM.
[19393] <prose> Though not visibly manifest,
[19394] <prose> In females, the pure elemental essence abides at the lower tip.
[19395] <prose> Within the secret place's space-protector wheel, the form of AH abides unseen.
[19396] <prose> This serves as the support for the Bindu's actual flow.
[19397] <prose> These two perform the action.
[19398] <prose> The Bindu's seed is named the gathering of elemental essences.
[19399] <prose> The Bindu's seed is the gathering of Bodhicitta.
[19400] <prose> These two seeds together constitute the self-essence. || 19400 ||
[19401] <prose> Distinguishing the difference between these two is essential.
[19402] <prose>
[19403] <prose> Arisen from masculine habituation is
