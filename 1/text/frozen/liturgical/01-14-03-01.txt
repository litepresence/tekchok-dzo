[17884] <ornament> First, the Essence.
[17885] <prose> The mind wherein object and subject arise as grasper and grasped—what is this non-knowing awareness that exists as the all-pervading ground?
[17886] <prose> The definition is as follows. || 10 ||
[17887] <prose> That which arises as the duality of grasper and grasped through object and subject is thus called "mind".
[17888] <prose> Even the mind of the above two is the grasping and grasped attached to one-pointed samadhi.
[17889] <prose> Within desire, all conceptions are coarse.
[17890] <prose> If distinctions are made:
[17891] <prose> There are two: pure and impure.
[17892] <prose> As for purity: the purity of mind-itself and
[17893] <prose> The purity of mind—two. || 20 ||
[17894] <prose> The purity of mind-itself is:
[17895] <prose> The Dharma-nature of emptiness, thusness, wherein mind and mental-factors and things are free from grasping marks—the self-Awareness of each in itself.
[17896] <prose> From the praise of Rahu's object:
[17897] <verse> The Prajnaparamita beyond speech, thought, and expression;
[17898] <verse> Unborn, unceasing, the nature of space;
[17899] <verse> The domain of self-knowing primordial-wisdom; || 30 ||
[17900] <verse> To the Mother of the Buddhas of the three times, homage!
[17901] <prose> Thus it is said.
[17902] <prose> The purity of mind is:
[17903] <prose> The samadhi arisen from path-time mind uncorrupted by conceptions—suitable as a cause of liberation, and
[17904] <prose> Realization-possessing compassion, arousal of mind, and so forth—suitable as causes of liberation.
[17905] <tantra> From the *Precious Garland*:
[17906] <verse> Possessing the essence of emptiness and compassion; || 40 ||
[17907] <verse> For some, enlightenment is accomplished.
[17908] <prose> Thus it is said.
[17909] <verse> Without attachment, without hatred, without delusion—
[17910] <verse> That which arises from these is virtue.
[17911] <prose> Such are these.
[17912] <prose> These all also: though they generally grasp the ultimate meaning of the self-arisen, they cannot directly objectify it;
[17913] <prose> Therefore they are gathered as mind belonging to the aspect of samsara.
[17914] <tantra> From the *Uttaratantra*:
[17915] <verse> The ultimate of the self-arisen itself. || 50 ||
[17916] <verse> The object of realization through faith itself.
[17917] <verse> Though the sun mandala is luminous,
[17918] <verse> Without eyes, there is no seeing.
[17919] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[17920] <prose> If distinctions are made regarding impure mind, there are two:
[17921] <prose> Briefly-shown and
[17922] <prose> Extensively-explained.
[17923] <prose> First: although there is no impurity in the expanse itself,
[17924] <prose> When that moves, the ground-appearance is not cut, and whatever arises appears. || 60 ||
[17925] <prose> From the play of non-Awareness arises mind.
[17926] <prose> From the ornament of mind arises intellect.
[17927] <prose> From intellect arise afflictions.
[17928] <prose> That play is capacity, power, or radiance—the mere tone arising from that.
[17929] <prose> Like a sprout from a seed, and
[17930] <prose> Like a reflection appearing in a mirror from the form of a face.
[17931] <prose> The ornament is the grain-portion ripening and arising from that—like the seed, flower, and mark. || 70 ||
[17932] <prose> Thus also from self-arising:
[17933] <prose> In the completely pure primordially-pure appearance, non-Awareness does not exist;
[17934] <prose> Mind does not exist;
[17935] <prose> Intellect does not exist.
[17936] <prose> From the power of spontaneous-accomplishment,
[17937] <prose> Non-Awareness arises.
[17938] <prose> From the play of non-Awareness, mind arises.
[17939] <prose> From the ornament of mind, intellect arises. || 80 ||
[17940] <prose> From the object of intellect, the five poisons arise.
[17941] <prose> From the five poisons, sixteen afflictions arise.
[17942] <prose> From the sixteen, twenty-five arise.
[17943] <prose> From that, fifty-one arise.
[17944] <prose> From that, eighty-four thousand arise—thus it is said. || 90 ||
[17945] <ornament> Second, the extensively-explained has three.
[17946] <prose> The division of root ignorance.
[17947] <prose> The division of mind arisen from that.
[17948] <prose> The extensively-explained division of afflictions arisen from that.
[17949] <ornament> First is again from that itself:
[17950] <prose> This ignorance is as follows.
[17951] <list> Root-mind ignorance and
[17952] <list> Object-confusion ignorance and
[17953] <list> Confusion-ground ignorance and || 100 ||
[17954] <list> Grasping-thought ignorance and
[17955] <list> Artificial-path ignorance and
[17956] <list> Not-knowing-delusion ignorance.
[17957] <prose> Thus ignorance arises as six forms—and "do not see self-appearance" is said.
[17958] <prose> That also, according to sequence:
[17959] <prose> First, through not-knowing one's own face of rigpa, the delusion of confusing self as other, and
[17960] <prose> The delusion of not-knowing that the essence of appearing objects is without nature. || 110 ||
[17961] <prose> The delusion of confusion from conditions—like confusing a scarecrow for a man—and
[17962] <prose> Though there is no self in the essence of rigpa, the delusion of self in the form—like calling it "my house"—and
[17963] <prose> Artificial like a path, and
[17964] <prose> The delusion of the antidote becoming poison, not granting liberation, and
[17965] <prose> Through not-knowing the naturally light-clear meaning, always deluded in samsara.
[17966] <ornament> Second, the division of mind arisen from that is:
[17967] <tantra> From *Self-Shine*:
[17968] <verse> The division of mind is as follows. || 120 ||
[17969] <verse> The division of mind is as follows.
[17970] <verse> The water-like mind gathering the various, and
[17971] <verse> The pig-like mind without pure-impure, and
[17972] <verse> The tiger-like mind of great bravery and timidity, and
[17973] <verse> The feather-like light mind, and
[17974] <verse> The wind-like moving mind, and || 130 ||
[17975] <verse> The mud-puddle-like greatly intoxicated mind, and
[17976] <verse> The fire-spark-like spreading mind, and
[17977] <verse> The bird-like desiring mind, and
[17978] <verse> The branch-like expanding mind, and
[17979] <verse> The garuda-like mind difficult to stop, and
[17980] <verse> The madman-like mind without planetary-tether—eleven, thus it is said.
[17981] <prose> Those also, according to sequence: object and latencies variously gathered—water; || 140 ||
[17982] <prose> Deluded in acceptance and rejection—pig;
[17983] <prose> Anger and pride coarse—tiger;
[17984] <prose> Entering many objects, not deciding focus—feather;
[17985] <prose> Moving without obstacle—wind;
[17986] <prose> Intoxicated by desire for objects—mire;
[17987] <prose> Spreading from one to many conceptions—fire;
[17988] <prose> Desiring to accept objects—bird;
[17989] <prose> Expanding knowledge power, examining meaning—branch;
[17990] <prose> Awareness grasped by objects, gone into their power—garuda; || 150 ||
[17991] <prose> The not-diverging object-knowledge without direction, wavering—madman-like mind.
[17992] <prose> These all also: object and condition gather as three minds—virtuous, non-virtuous, and unspecified.
[17993] <prose> From mind arises intellect.
[17994] <prose> All-searching intellect, etc.—six.
[17995] <ornament> Third, the division of afflictions arisen from that has three. || 160 ||
[17996] <prose> Six root afflictions.
[17997] <prose> Sixteen proximate afflictions.
[17998] <prose> Subtle-arisen clear limitless afflictions.
[17999] <ornament> First is from *Sun-Moon Union*:
[18000] <verse> Afflictions are six.
[18001] <verse> Non-awareness is called the grasping of the delusion-conception part of the ground. || 170 ||
[18002] <verse> Delusion is delusion from the wisdom part.
[18003] <verse> Anger is delusion from the sequence of arising.
[18004] <verse> Pride is delusion from the view part.
[18005] <verse> Desire is delusion from the appearance part.
[18006] <verse> Jealousy is delusion from the not-realized part—thus.
[18007] <prose> That also, according to sequence: object-subject delusion-conception part delusion, and
[18008] <prose> Not-knowing the reverse from wisdom-awareness, and || 180 ||
[18009] <prose> Hating objects, and
[18010] <prose> The pride of "I am", and
[18011] <prose> Desiring objects, and
[18012] <prose> Anger at others through not realizing meaning.
[18013] <ornament> Second, the sixteen proximate afflictions are:
[18014] <tantra> From *Self-Arisen*:
[18015] <verse> The sixteen—what are they? || 190 ||
[18016] <verse> Non-awareness and
[18017] <verse> Mind and
[18018] <verse> Intellect and
[18019] <verse> Grasping and
[18020] <verse> Conception and
[18021] <verse> Not-knowing and
[18022] <verse> Not-seeing and
[18023] <verse> Not-realizing and || 200 ||
[18024] <verse> Not-understanding and
[18025] <verse> That self impure and
[18026] <verse> Grasping as "I" and
[18027] <verse> Doing jealousy toward others and
[18028] <verse> Desire and
[18029] <verse> Attachment and
[18030] <verse> Pride and
[18031] <verse> Spreading—sixteen, thus.
[18032] <prose> These all also, according to sequence:
[18033] <prose> Through not-knowing that alone, delusion makes all afflicted; || 210 ||
[18034] <prose> Grasping mind on objects, and
[18035] <prose> Grasping intellect on subject, and
[18036] <prose> Grasping self in both, and
[18037] <prose> All conceptions, and
[18038] <prose> Non-awareness of meaning, and
[18039] <prose> Not seeing the aim of nature, and || 220 ||
[18040] <prose> Not realizing word-meaning, and
[18041] <prose> Not understanding general-specific, and
[18042] <prose> Knowing delusion, the former promise wrong form, and
[18043] <prose> Grasping objects as "mine", and
[18044] <prose> Not rejoicing in others' excellence, and
[18045] <prose> Taking objects, and
[18046] <prose> Special desire for objects, and
[18047] <prose> Puffing and pride from the slightest, and
[18048] <prose> Spreading anger at objects.
[18049] <ornament> Third, subtle-arisen clear limitless afflictions has three. || 230 ||
[18050] <prose> Twenty-five.
[18051] <prose> Fifty-one.
[18052] <prose> Eighty-four thousand.
[18053] <prose> First: since root non-Awareness exists as pervader, not counted separately.
[18054] <prose> Dividing the pervaded five-poisons into five—twenty-five.
[18055] <tantra> From *Self-Arisen*:
[18056] <verse> Five in delusion.
[18057] <verse> Greatly-dull delusion, and || 240 ||
[18058] <verse> Not-knowing delusion, and
[18059] <verse> Not-seeing delusion, and
[18060] <verse> Very-dark delusion, and
[18061] <verse> Greatly-intoxicated delusion—five.
[18062] <prose> Desire also five:
[18063] <verse> Face-desire, and
[18064] <verse> Greatly-tormented desire, and
[18065] <verse> Desire not-caring for life, and || 250 ||
[18066] <verse> Desire possessing anger, and
[18067] <verse> Desire moving in space—five.
[18068] <prose> Anger also five:
[18069] <verse> Anger with much desire, and
[18070] <verse> Anger possessing rage, and
[18071] <verse> Very-coarse anger, and
[18072] <verse> Anger possessing delusion, and
[18073] <verse> Anger like time's thunder-rain—five. || 260 ||
[18074] <prose> Pride also five:
[18075] <verse> Lion-like suppressing pride, and
[18076] <verse> Sky-like above-nonexistent pride, and
[18077] <verse> Tiger-like great bravery pride, and
[18078] <verse> Vulture-like "I am" thinking pride, and
[18079] <verse> Elephant-like unequal-equal pride—five.
[18080] <prose> Jealousy also five: || 270 ||
[18081] <verse> Subtle jealousy, and
[18082] <verse> Jealousy arising from "I", and
[18083] <verse> Very-harsh jealousy, and
[18084] <verse> Coarse jealousy, and
[18085] <verse> View jealousy—five.
[18086] <prose> That is the twenty-five afflictions, thus.
[18087] <prose> Second, fifty-one: on the twenty-five, object-grasping afflictions twenty-five;
[18088] <prose> Subject-grasping afflictions twenty-five—fifty; || 280 ||
[18089] <prose> Root non-awareness and root one arise.
[18090] <ornament> Third, eighty-four thousand is:
[18091] <prose> From desire become twenty-one thousand.
[18092] <prose> From anger become twenty-one thousand.
[18093] <prose> From delusion become twenty-one thousand.
[18094] <prose> From equal-parts become twenty-one thousand. || 290 ||
[18095] <prose> Summed: thousand eight and four.
[18096] <prose> Eighty-four thousand afflictions also: if distinguished clearly and limitlessly, measureless, mind-incomprehensible.
[18097] <tantra> That also from arising:
[18098] <verse> From that, mind-incomprehensible, speech-unutterable.
[18099] <verse> Count-not-possible arise—thus. || 300 ||
[18100] <prose> These all also: mind and
[18101] <prose> Intellect and
[18102] <prose> Recollection and
[18103] <prose> Latency and
[18104] <prose> Doubt produce and all arise, and through affliction influence imprint samsara-afflicting actions.
[18105] <tantra> From *Sun-Moon Union*:
[18106] <verse> These, etc.—afflictions: mind following and holding all thoughts, and || 310 ||
[18107] <verse> Intellect following and holding all recollections, and
[18108] <verse> Latency connecting intervals, and
[18109] <verse> Conception becoming the ground of all doubt, and
[18110] <verse> Object and thing grasping parts, etc.—measureless, thus.
[18111] <prose> Thus all karma and afflictions depend on the mind and mental-factors of the three realms.
[18112] <prose> That also: the eight groups of consciousness.
[18113] <prose> The ground-all consciousness, not thinking objects, appearing cause—clear conception-free consciousness, and || 320 ||
[18114] <prose> From that spreading: five doors of knowledge.
[18115] <prose> Eye consciousness grasping form, conception-free.
[18116] <prose> Ear consciousness grasping sound, conception-free.
[18117] <prose> Nose consciousness grasping smell, conception-free.
[18118] <prose> Tongue consciousness grasping taste, realization-free.
[18119] <prose> Body consciousness grasping touch, conception-free.
[18120] <prose> From that: two grasping-holder intellect-consciousnesses.
[18121] <prose> Intellect-consciousness first generally grasping objects, and || 330 ||
[18122] <prose> After, particular grasping affliction-intellect.
[18123] <prose> Grasped and grasper.
[18124] <prose> On these two intellect-consciousnesses:
[18125] <prose> Three exist—virtuous, non-virtuous, and unspecified, and
[18126] <prose> Conception-possessing and conception-free exist as suitable.
[18127] <prose> The five doors and basis-all consciousness are conception-free.
[18128] <prose> Thus all fifty-one mind and mental-factors of the three realms are only to-be-abandoned superimpositions. || 340 ||
[18129] <tantra> From *Two Truths*:
[18130] <verse> Mind and mental-factors of the three realms.
[18131] <verse> Superimposition-form-possessing conceptions.
[18132] <verse> Thus.
[18133] <prose> These are to-be-abandoned objects.
[18134] <prose> Because they are the nature of non-awareness.
[18135] <prose> Here, making mind the path, desiring Buddha, even through the tradition of the great texts of Madhyamaka, etc.,
[18136] <prose> Distinguishing mind and mind-itself as two, gathering the nature of mind group eight or seven or six as to-be-abandoned, || 350 ||
[18137] <prose> Realizing mind-itself as naturally pure as to-be-accepted, entering the cultivation of the path.
[18138] <prose> This also is similar to that in part.
[18139] <prose> Awareness and the mind-itself arisen from awareness, and
[18140] <prose> Mind grasping self-characteristics—thus explained. || 360 ||
[18141] <tantra> From *Six-Expanse*:
[18142] <verse> Hey, great mind-hero!
[18143] <verse> The mind-itself arisen from awareness is beyond all stains and conceptions.
[18144] <verse> Briefly: all causes and fruits of nirvana.
[18145] <verse> The object-field of beings who see awareness's self-appearance.
[18146] <prose> Mind grasping self-characteristics is: thus all superimposed appearances, and
[18147] <prose> Exist-appearances, and
[18148] <prose> Not-exist-appearances, and || 370 ||
[18149] <prose> Appearances, and
[18150] <prose> Renown, and
[18151] <prose> Views, and
[18152] <prose> Meditation, and
[18153] <prose> All conduct-appearances, and
[18154] <prose> Grasping, and
[18155] <prose> Conceptions, and
[18156] <prose> Afflictions.
[18157] <prose> All appearing thought-objects.
[18158] <prose> Briefly: all samsara Dharmas are mind grasping self-characteristics. || 380 ||
[18159] <prose> All self-same appearances of the six classes of beings—thus it is spoken.
[18160] <prose> If asked whether these two are the same:
[18161] <prose> There is great difference.
[18162] <prose> Whatever view-meditation-conduct is done through the common vehicle cannot transcend mind, and
[18163] <prose> Here, through directly realizing awareness not-mixed with mind, much is more superior, etc.
[18164] <ornament> Fourth, regarding each meaning: ground of mind, and || 390 ||
[18165] <prose> Abode, and
[18166] <prose> Path, and
[18167] <prose> Door, and
[18168] <prose> Essence, and
[18169] <prose> Power, and
[18170] <prose> Action, and
[18171] <prose> Fruit—eight.
[18172] <prose> The ground is the form aggregate, the upper torso and chest.
[18173] <prose> The abode: from the heart, connected to the lungs, in the interval, from the navel aorta tube, awareness-tone rides on the wind-horse, abiding. || 400 ||
[18174] <prose> The wind is like a blind horse with legs.
[18175] <prose> The awareness-tone is like a non-spreading person with eyes.
[18176] <prose> If these two do not mix as one, nine-movement non-movement conceptions do not arise;
[18177] <prose> Through awareness-tone abiding in self-aspect,
[18178] <prose> Though objects appear, not thinking of them—knowledge clear-dawn half arises.
[18179] <prose> Through the essential-point of wind:
[18180] <prose> That is the continuum-mark distinguishing wind and awareness. || 410 ||
[18181] <prose> Through mixing these two, conception unclear nine-clear arises.
[18182] <prose> The moving part is wind.
[18183] <prose> The awareness part is awareness-tone.
[18184] <prose> That also: the actual awareness inside the heart is like water.
[18185] <prose> From that, power-tone enters the navel channel, mixing with wind—that mind is like a water-bubble.
[18186] <prose> That mind is the awareness channel-path tone.
[18187] <prose> That also: mind follows awareness exist-not-exist. || 420 ||
[18188] <prose> Awareness does not follow mind exist-not-exist go-return.
[18189] <prose> In essence, awareness does not become subject to mind's power;
[18190] <prose> Since it is power, mind becomes subject to awareness's power.
[18191] <prose> If awareness moves, mind's conception is impossible—
[18192] <prose> Like waves cannot arise if water does not move.
[18193] <tantra> From *Self-Arisen*:
[18194] <verse> The example of mind and awareness is the manner of water and bubble. || 430 ||
[18195] <verse> Mind does not become subject to power—thus.
[18196] <prose> The path: from the life-channel, it moves.
[18197] <prose> Because from there the mind-horse, life-wind moves.
[18198] <prose> The door is:
[18199] <prose> Mouth and nose two—for wind exits from there.
[18200] <prose> The essence: samsara's nature of grasping-holder.
[18201] <prose> The power: grasping objects and clinging to self.
[18202] <prose> The action: doing various samsara pleasures-pains. || 440 ||
[18203] <prose> The fruit: endless samsara and lower realms.
[18204] <prose> That word also from *Self-Arisen*:
[18205] <verse> Impure nature is
[18206] <verse> On all beings' self-continuum,
[18207] <verse> Impure three-layer abiding.
[18208] <verse> That also, nature this like.
[18209] <verse> Between heart and lungs,
[18210] <verse> Three-layer abiding.
[18211] <verse> From there, navel from moving. || 450 ||
[18212] <verse> Life, navel from path arises.
[18213] <verse> Door: mouth and nose from arising.
[18214] <verse> From that, thousand eight-ten.
[18215] <verse> That, etc., afflictions,
[18216] <verse> Various many arising.
[18217] <verse> Thus and.
[18218] <tantra> From *Vajrasattva Heart Mirror Tantra*:
[18219] <verse> On all beings gathered by life, much ignorance-called affliction abides. || 460 ||
[18220] <verse> That also, depending on the form aggregate basis, abides between heart and lungs.
[18221] <verse> That also, non-awareness alone does not exist.
[18222] <verse> "Mind," thus called, adorned with all gathered latencies, abides.
[18223] <verse> On that, "intellect," thus called, together with object-thinking, abides.
[18224] <verse> From these three gathered as one, non-awareness—thus, in samsara.
[18225] <verse> From that, five-poisons and anger-hatred—six arise.
[18226] <verse> From that, eighty-four thousand afflictions arise.
[18227] <verse> What path do these arise from? || 470 ||
[18228] <verse> Between lung and heart connected, the red life-channel thus called.
[18229] <verse> Upward moves inside the navel tube just.
[18230] <verse> That also, upward moves on the spine's wing.
[18231] <verse> That also, connects with the small left tip.
[18232] <verse> Those ride on the breath-horse, moving.
[18233] <verse> That also, moves from mouth and nose.
[18234] <verse> From that, various actions and afflictions arise—thus it is said.
[18235] <prose> The channel between heart and lung is:
[18236] <prose> From the lung, wind's horse-channel enters there, and || 480 ||
[18237] <prose> From the heart, rigpa-resonance channel enters there—two meeting.
[18238] <prose> From mixing wind and rigpa-resonance:
[18239] <prose> The latencies-gathering-agent mind.
[18240] <prose> The ignorance depending on rigpa, object-thinking mind—empty essence one, returning differently, three-tiered, dwelling on the wind-horse.

[18257] <verse> It causes falling into the ocean of samsara.
[18258] <verse> Through being free from that conceptual-thought:
[18259] <verse> You are always in nirvana.
[18260] <verse> Thus. || 510 ||
