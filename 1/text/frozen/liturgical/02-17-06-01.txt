[2921] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[2922] <prose> Two types of transfer-action.
[2923] <prose> Actual itself, emptiness.
[2924] <prose> Actual included by form.
[2925] <tantra> From mastering elements thus.
[2926] <prose> And made depending upon familiarized wind.
[2927] <prose> Upon whatever actual-form.
[2928] <prose> Able to move by placed awareness.
[2929] <prose> Then begin actual-transfer.
[2930] <prose> Chief is familiarized emptiness-mind. || 2930 ||
[2931] <prose> Dharma-space, Dharmakaya.
[2932] <prose> Know by non-dual practice-emptiness.
[2933] <prose> Upon emptiness-clear nature.
[2934] <prose> Mind also within that's state.
[2935] <prose> By complete dependent-arising ritual.
[2936] <prose> Method of releasing point-transfer, and.
[2937] <prose> Know from voice-recitation.
[2938] <prose> By each element-body meeting.
[2939] <prose> Do transfer by seeing only.
[2940] <prose> By skilled wind-joined. || 2940 ||
[2941] <prose> However, if reached upon actual-accomplishment.
[2942] <prose> Accomplish all actions by invisible-form.
[2943] <prose> If see substance of actual-attachment.
[2944] <prose> Take by transfer because offer to guru.

[2949] <prose> By possessing attract-mind.
[2950] <prose> Do transfer by yogi. || 2950 ||
[2951] <prose> Thus it is.
[2952] <prose> Accomplish transfer by mastering wind of all four elements in nature, and.
[2953] <prose> Accomplish by especially mastering karma-wind.
[2954] <prose> Transfer is also appearance-mind mixed, power obtained over elements.
[2955] <prose> Not only transfer sickness alone, bliss-suffering fixation, and.
[2956] <prose> Area and—
[2957] <prose> Transfer forests etc. not exists.

[2959] <prose> Attract transfer here that exists within other area.
[2960] <prose> Project transfer to other that exists here. || 2960 ||
[2961] <prose> Transfer like sentient-beings coming to inanimate-actual's self-place.
[2962] <prose> Draw mount, girl, etc. by wind to sky, transfer to self-place.
[2963] <prose> For example: great master Padma transferred Mangyul mountains, and—
[2964] <prose> Transferred Ne'u-thang and tree-forest within Samye, like exists until now.
[2965] <prose> This is supreme for accomplishing yogi's wishes.
[2966] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[2967] <prose> Yogi of great fortune wishes transfer.
[2968] <prose> Upon included rigpa-with mind.
[2969] <prose> Upon living that appears as form.

[2976] <prose> By numbers, code, sounds.
[2977] <prose> Transfer sickness etc. by transforming focus.
[2978] <prose> Wood, stones, pieces, and—
[2979] <prose> Grass, sticks, twists, etc.
[2980] <prose> Thus water, earth, sky also. || 2980 ||
[2981] <prose> Hold certainly transfer-action.
[2982] <prose> Transform by yoga-mind-power.
[2983] <prose> Thus it is.
[2984] <ornament> Second: Dream—two:
[2985] <prose> Preliminary and—
[2986] <prose> Actual.
[2987] <prose> First, from three:
[2988] <prose> Training—day prostrations, circumambulations, recitation, mind's projection-gathering by force—purified body-speech-mind three—many flickering-flickering dreams arise—is measure of mastered.
[2989] <prose> Thus, then from those dreams—examine latency subtle-thick—then day very relaxed, slightly trembling release—think hold and examine dream—made without distraction from one-pointed.
[2990] <prose> If much dream of before-fixation objects etc. || 2990 ||
[2991] <prose> Because great before-fixation latency—difficult, easy, medium transform.
[2992] <prose> If much dream now—very easy—mastered in about three-four days.
[2993] <prose> And place not reached before.
[2994] <prose> If dream human etc. not-experienced meet—difficult to cut.
[2995] <prose> If three all mixed-mixed dream—three latencies combined—very difficult to cut.
[2996] <prose> Suppress is dream-hold.
[2997] <prose> Upon this—aspiration one-pointed only—oral-instruction point is.
[2998] <prose> By made sudden stable aspiration, certainty, thinking day-dream is here arose.
[2999] <prose> Night held certainly.
[3000] <prose> This time—cheat people, transform. || 3000 ||
[3001] <prose> Emanate, transform, and—
[3002] <prose> By train capacity of area, realms, view, etc.
[3003] <prose> Is suppress appearance.
[3004] <prose> By made first great guru-devotion, aspiration upon that.
