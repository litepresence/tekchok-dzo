[16360] <prose> The first is path-appearance, for the great treasury of spontaneous presence's primordial purity—meaningful fruition like a house— || 16360 ||
[16361] <prose> One enters there and emerges again; from primordial purity one must manifest as external display.
[16362] <prose> The manner of arising is manifestation from essence abiding as kāya.
[16363] <prose> Path-appearance has two types:
[16364] <list> The path of making oneself a Buddha, preceding fruition;
[16365] <list> Hence, the path of guiding those to be trained, having made oneself a Buddha, kāyas manifesting for benefit.
[16366] <prose> Thus here it is considered the path-appearance of no-more-learning—the meaning wherein two are non-contradictory and connected: three kāyas as path-appearance and as fruition.
[16367] <ornament> The meaning wherein result is two, contradictory, — yet relationship is established.
[16368] <prose> The liberated Dharma-kāya's three kāyas manifesting externally as path from the inner Expanse—these emanations of kāyas and wisdoms—
[16369] <prose> Dharma-kāya as wisdom-mind,
[16370] <prose> Saṃbhoga-kāya as that very kāya, || 16370 ||
[16371] <prose> Emanation-kāya appearing as deeds—for benefit arises.
[16372] <prose> Moreover, the inner clear manifestation-ground of kāyas and wisdoms without gathering or separation, and Vajrasattva's Dharmatā,
[16373] <prose> And from that, the externally clear three kāyas' path-appearance self-manifesting, though similar in awareness's state,
[16374] <prose> External and internal distinction is distinguished;
[16375] <prose> Therefore, <tantra> From the aspect of self-appearance, saṃbhoga and emanation manifest in the appearance-perception of those to be trained for their benefit.
[16376] <prose> Though a single awareness-display,
[16377] <prose> Self-appearance is not seen by those to be trained,
[16378] <prose> Yet that which manifests from it is seen—thus distinguishing between the two similars.
[16379] <tantra> From Lion's Perfect Power:
[16380] <tantra> "Vajrasattva's Dharmatā and || 16380 ||
[16381] <tantra> Self-appearance's pure maṇḍala—two,
[16382] <tantra> Similar in ground, — yet greatly divergent."
[16383] <tantra> Thus it is explained.
[16384] <prose> Thus inner Expanse and
[16385] <prose> External clear path-appearance aspect, without division,
[16386] <prose> If three kāyas are considered self-appearance's fruition,
[16387] <prose> Emanation-kāya appears to those to be trained like a reflection,
[16388] <prose> So liberation-ground's primordially pure Dharma-kāya would appear to those to be trained,
[16389] <prose> For three kāyas are of single essence.
[16390] <prose> Dharma-kāya would appear as radiance-gathering and color, || 16390 ||
[16391] <prose> For saṃbhoga and emanation of the same essence as you appear.
[16392] <prose> Or else, emanation-kāya would not appear to those to be trained,
[16393] <prose> For Dharma-kāya does not appear.
[16394] <break> <prose> Therefore, though three kāyas are known as single essence,
[16395] <break> <prose> That single-essence variety is not to be adopted;
[16396] <prose> Emanation-kāya is compassion-aspect,
[16397] <prose> Yet its emanated appearance is merely reflected emanation,
[16398] <prose> Not true emanation-kāya,
[16399] <prose> For it is not compassion.
[16400] <break> <prose> This distinction of philosophical systems is extremely subtle; intelligent ones should investigate and understand. || 16400 ||
[16401] <break> <prose> These are crucial essential points.
[16402] <prose> The second, explanation of the topic at hand, comprises three aspects:
[16403] <list> General presentation of three kāyas' fields;
[16404] <list> Detailed explanation of wisdoms' fields;
[16405] <list> Summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities' five fields' meaning.
[16406] <ornament> The first: from Dharma-kāya,
[16407] <prose> Saṃbhoga-kāya,
[16408] <prose> Emanation-kāya—
