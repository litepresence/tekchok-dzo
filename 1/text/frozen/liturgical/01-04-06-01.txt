[2873] <ornament> First: through reasoning that examines and dissects, when nothing is established as dharma-nature, wisdom that realizes all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature.
[2874] <prose> As the Two Truths states:
[2875] <tantra> "Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate,
[2876] <tantra> And thinking also accordant purpose."
[2877] <prose> When all elaborations of arising cease and peace is attained,
[2878] <prose> This is termed "the ultimate."
[2879] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[2880] <ornament> Second:
[2881] <prose> Phenomena, primordial from the very beginning, transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence; their sphere is pure by its very nature.
[2882] <prose> As the Root Wisdom states: || 10 ||
[2883] <tantra> "Peace that is not known from elsewhere,
[2884] <tantra> Conceptuality is nothing, meaning is not differentiated.
[2885] <tantra> Non-elaboration through all elaborations."
[2886] <prose> This is its essential characteristic.
[2887] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[2888] <ornament> Second: the stages of knowing and practicing.
[2889] <prose> Whether the bodhisattva householder has taken the vow of the lay practitioner or not, it is suitable to enter the path.
[2890] <prose> If fully ordained, one enters the ten places of novice discipline.
[2891] <prose> The bhikṣu discipline consists of two hundred and fifty precepts.
[2892] <prose> Based upon the bhikṣuṇī discipline of three hundred and sixty-three precepts, || 20 ||
[2893] <prose> Generating the mind of Great Vehicle aspiration and entering,
[2894] <prose> Abiding in the eighty-five training sutras,
[2895] <prose> The four establishments of mindfulness in the small path of accumulation,
[2896] <prose> The four correct abandonments in the medium path,
[2897] <prose> The four miraculous feet in the great path,
[2898] <prose> The five faculties of heat and peak in the path of preparation,
[2899] <prose> The five strengths of patience and supreme dharma in the peak path,
[2900] <prose> The seven limbs of the path of enlightenment in the path of seeing,
[2901] <prose> The eight aspects of the superior paths in the nine grounds of meditation,
[2902] <prose> Completing with complete signs of heat in the great joy of the ground-paths. || 30 ||
[2903] <prose> Manifesting the path of the non-learner.
[2904] <ornament> Third: the fruit of complete perfection.
[2905] <prose> Upon the ground of all-illumination, for self-purpose, the dharma-body is obtained,
[2906] <prose> Having obtained the two supreme form-bodies for the benefit of others,
[2907] <prose> Beholding all that is and the extent of all with the two wisdoms,
[2908] <prose> Working for the benefit of beings until saṃsāra is emptied.
[2909] <prose> As the Entrance to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states:
[2910] <tantra> "The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
[2911] <break> <tantra> Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, free from all thought,
[2912] <tantra> Working for the benefit of the world until liberation is attained. || 40 ||
[2913] <break> <tantra> This is appearance free from elaboration."
[2914] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[2915] <prose> The manner of these, extensively:
[2916] <tantra> From self-appearing awareness.
[2917] <prose> The bodhisattva vehicle:
[2918] <prose> The doors of entry are the two truths: the ultimate and the conventional.
[2919] <prose> The manner of protection: the limbs of discipline—
[2920] <prose> Eighty-four vows,
[2921] <prose> View and wisdom of emptiness.
[2922] <prose> The ultimate and conventional are thus: || 50 ||
[2923] <prose> The conventional is conceived in two aspects: the false and the truly correct.
[2924] <prose> The false conventional is thus: all imputed appearances.
[2925] <break> <prose> They appear in accord but possess the power to function.
[2926] <break> <prose> When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence;
[2927] <prose> Meaning appears as if non-existent.
[2928] <prose> This is the false conventional.
[2929] <prose> The truly conventional is thus: the actions of the ten virtues,
[2930] <prose> The thoughts that become white or virtuous,
[2931] <prose> The thoughts of faith to whatever extent—
[2932] <prose> Conceived as the truly conventional great: || 60 ||
[2933] <prose> Generosity, discipline, and so forth,
[2934] <prose> And concentration and so forth.
[2935] <prose> The truly conventional great.
[2936] <prose> The ultimate also has two aspects:
[2937] <prose> The nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate,
[2938] <prose> The truly mental ultimate.
[2939] <prose> By the nominal ultimate, all are refuted and debated.
[2940] <prose> That also is the reasoning of valid cognition:
[2941] <prose> Whatever that nature is, it appears as such.
[2942] <prose> The great emptiness of words— || 70 ||
[2943] <prose> The meaning is empty, — yet not realized.
[2944] <prose> The nominal ultimate.
[2945] <prose> The truly mental ultimate:
[2946] <prose> Emptiness utterly without anything, one thinks to meditate—
[2947] <prose> Like the empty sky,
[2948] <prose> The meaning of emptiness is just suchness itself.
[2949] <prose> Emptiness is unceasing, limitless.
[2950] <prose> Thus one acts and attaches.
[2951] <prose> The path is thus conceived,
[2952] <prose> One thinks to purify upon the ground. || 80 ||
[2953] <prose> That also has heat, patience arises—
[2954] <prose> Peak, world, supreme dharma.
[2955] <prose> Ultimate meaning signs are made.
[2956] <prose> Thus it is.
[2957] <ornament> Second:
[2958] <prose> Phenomena, primordially beyond existence and non-existence elaborations, the expanse primordially pure by nature—
[2959] <break> <tantra> From the Root of Wisdom:
[2960] <break> <prose> Through three aspects of heat, it is taught.
[2961] <prose> The outer, the inner, and both together.
[2962] <prose> The outer heat arises thus: || 90 ||
[2963] <ornament> The second: from the stainless ground.
[2964] <prose> Entities appear as empty.
[2965] <prose> That is the practice of concentration.
[2966] <prose> It is taught to arise in the two pure grounds.
[2967] <prose> The inner heat is the sixth ground.
[2968] <prose> Understanding the pure knowable as empty.
[2969] <prose> The heat of both is thus.
[2970] <prose> Seventh: it is taught to arise from the pure.
[2971] <prose> Eighth: patience is attained.
[2972] <prose> Ninth: the peak is reached. || 100 ||
[2973] <break> <prose> Tenth: supreme dharma of the world.
[2974] <break> <prose> Similarly, the ten grounds are obtained.
[2975] <prose> This is the vehicle of enlightenment.
[2976] <prose> Emptiness beyond words and letters.
[2977] <prose> Utterly without, one thinks emptiness.
[2978] <prose> Thus it is said.
[2979] <ornament> Second: The explanation of established tenet views, divided into two.
[2980] <prose> The explanation of the mind-only and middle-way traditions.
[2981] <ornament> First: All these appearing as white and red various appearances with consciousness, asserted by the mind-only school as truly real in the aspect of one's own mind—the true aspect of mind-only.
[2982] <prose> The false aspect of consciousness asserted by mind-only as false—these two. || 110 ||
