[6062] <tantra> From the Rinpoche spungs pa Tantra: || 100 ||
[6063] <prose> The nature of great perfection:
[6064] <prose> All meanings enter the center of mind;
[6065] <prose> Non-vision, objectless, without conceptuality,

[6127] <prose> How thoughts and memories move,
[6128] <prose> Like a river's flow, without interval,
[6129] <prose> Always attracting self-mind.

[6132] <prose> This vision hearing existing container-contents, || 170 ||
[6133] <prose> Although natureless through examination,
[6134] <prose> Like cutting the continuum of village-city,
[6135] <prose> Not seeing primordial abiding.
[6136] <prose> Doors of powers closed?
[6137] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:

[6140] <prose> Not seen before as wisdom,
[6141] <tantra> From basis of delusion with concept not existing,
[6142] <prose> Realizing Kunzhi as great Dharmakāya, || 180 ||
[6143] <prose> Delusion's self-concept continuum ceases.
[6144] <prose> Thus, non-deluded vision

[6336] <prose> General explanation through examining three goings of arising-places, and
[6337] <prose> Particular certainty through examining one and different.
[6338] <ornament> First:

[6347] <prose> Examining arising-place and arising-agent;
[6348] <prose> Examining abiding-place and abiding-agent;
[6349] <prose> Examining going-place and going-agent.
[6350] <prose> First, from the two:
[6351] <prose> Arising place: outer various objects appearing,
[6352] <prose> Inner: aggregates appearing as form. || 390 ||
[6353] <prose> 
[6354] <prose> 
[6355] <prose> 
[6356] <prose> 
[6357] <prose> When either of those two minds dawns:
[6358] <prose> Dawned outward: outer object;
[6359] <prose> Dawned inward: inner body.
[6360] <prose> Examining dust-particles without parts, dividing layer by layer,
[6361] <prose> Seeing arising-place's vision-object non-existent, recognizing mind did not arise from that—cutting connection to great root-free basis of concept holding grasped object.
[6362] <prose> If arising-agent sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mental-events arise from themselves, momentary knowing becomes two substances; || 400 ||
[6363] <prose> Examining complete: not arising from self or other.
[6364] <prose> Now, thinking that arising-place arises self-arisen:
[6365] <prose> Color,
[6366] <prose> Shape,
[6367] <prose> Sign,
[6368] <prose> Characteristic,
[6369] <prose> Big-small,
[6370] <prose> Direction-part, etc.—examining what exists, not abiding anywhere.
[6371] <prose> Merely mind-examined, basisless, gone everywhere primordially pure,
[6372] <prose> Inner holding-concept, basisless like sky, realized by self, || 410 ||
[6373] <prose> Wherein, all grasping-holding appearing as dharma and dharmatā, realized at that time as great support-free without object.
[6374] <prose> Realizing today mind's primordial non-arising at first—understanding meaning of great elaboration-free Dharmakāya.
[6375] <ornament> Second: Middle abiding-place and abiding-agent.
[6376] <ornament> Third: Likewise destroying and examining end going-place and going-agent two,
[6377] <prose> Touching intention of great self-luminous Sambhogakāya and
[6378] <prose> Self-free self-dawning emanation body.
[6379] <prose> Outer-inner objectless, unsupported awareness;
[6380] <prose> Grasping-holding basisless;
[6381] <prose> Understanding meaning of equal intention without interval.
[6382] <prose> Self-Buddha great equality dawning interiorly as unmeditated river-flow samadhi. || 420 ||
[6383] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[6384] <prose> Mind: first arising place,
[6385] <prose> Middle abiding place, end going place.
[6386] <prose> Thus examining and analyzing the three,
[6387] <prose> Purify mind, know mind's abiding manner.
[6388] <prose> At that time, all outer object-vision non-existent, suddenly basisless vision;
[6389] <prose> All inner mind-concepts dawn-free, without trace.
[6390] <prose> 
[6391] <prose> Called "dawning in mind-exhaustion the intention of dharma-exhaustion" through seeing great copper-shining without connection between vision and mind.
[6392] <prose> These are said in the Arya Ratnakuta: || 430 ||
[6393] <prose> Kashyapa, herein bodhisattvas mahasattvas begin the diligence of fully searching mind.
[6394] <prose> That mind is not observed outwardly,
[6395] <prose> Not observed inwardly,
[6396] <prose> Not existing and not observed in the interval of both.
[6397] <prose> Not blue,
[6398] <prose> Not yellow, and so forth.
[6399] <prose> Supreme among all diligences to that is the diligence of fully searching mind—thus said.
[6400] <ornament> Second: Examining one and different—
[6401] <prose> The instruction of destroying mind's house.
[6402] <prose> Moreover: if this called "mind" exists, from what cause does it arise? || 440 ||
[6403] <prose> If non-existent, what are this movement and memory-knowing wheel?
[6404] <prose> Upon what condition do these memory-knowing aspects depend to arise?
[6405] <break> <prose> Without condition, these sudden memory-knowings are unsuitable.
[6406] <break> <prose> If this mind exists as one with body, it would also be destroyed when body is destroyed;
[6407] <prose> If non-existent, with uncertain following-return, body-sickness would come to mind.
[6408] <prose> Unsuitable for before-after birth wheel to come.
[6409] <prose> If "mind" here is one, through one realm's powers ceasing, other realms should also die;
[6410] <prose> If not one, realm minds should differ like realm forms differ; if different, all those insects and beings inside one body
[6411] <prose> Should live when one person's life-time is done.
[6412] <prose> If one, what is this coming of numberless outer-inner beings to one body? || 450 ||
[6413] <prose> If this mind has a returning place,
