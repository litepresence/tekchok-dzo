[13104] <prose> First, for the mind of the gandharva entering nearby, seeking a body—the manner of coming.
[13105] <prose> Father and Mother, joining and dissolving in wisdom-space, from the mother's birth passage entering.
[13106] <prose> The father's white essence, the size of a mustard seed, clear small eye—like quicksilver.
[13107] <prose> Absorbed into the red essence of the mother's lineage channel.
[13108] <prose> In the mother's womb, like blood and milk mixed, becoming one from that.
[13109] <prose> The manner of the body's formation explained: first, the support of the body's formation is:
[13110] <prose> From the four elements empty, space like the sky abiding.
[13111] <prose> From those parents' self-nature afflictions and the channels' leaves' wind, desire-mind moved.
[13112] <prose> From the channel-abode's letter wind's self-sound YAM, from that state the fire desire actually blazing.
[13113] <prose> RAM—like that sound moves, blazing and changing—appearance. || 10 ||

[13119] <prose> From embracing and sense-faculties joined.
[13120] <prose> From the earth stability of the body, bliss experienced.
[13121] <prose> SAM self-sound arises.
[13122] <prose> The mother's lineage five channels twisted, that moon-time and seven-day period becoming.
[13123] <prose> Red, like an iron hook drawing, the wind power possessing that. || 20 ||
[13124] <prose> The father's essence, the cause's self-nature from crown drawn.
[13125] <prose> Like iron gathering in the magnet.
[13126] <prose> From the father's twenty-eight vertebrae passed through, the white channel-path emerged from the white shell-like cavity.
[13127] <prose> For seven days, four times in the mother's womb, the body's basis held and son bodhicitta white arising—the essential point.
[13128] <prose> Then at the vajra channel-base, great bliss path opened.
[13129] <prose> At the navel, bliss poured into the sheep-like.
[13130] <prose> At the tip, bliss ripened.
[13131] <prose> Directly emerging to the mouth, into the mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone absorbed.
[13132] <prose> In the womb like blood and milk mixed, one absorbed into one, two lineages possessing.
[13133] <prose> From the lineage five's power, the father's consciousness also drawn inside like. || 30 ||
[13134] <prose> Later, free from attachment, going by vomit.
[13135] <prose> The mother whatever lineage pulling-possessing, to bliss contentment not-knowing is.
[13136] <prose> From desire-attachment cause-condition arisen.
[13137] <prose> Desire and attachment two.
