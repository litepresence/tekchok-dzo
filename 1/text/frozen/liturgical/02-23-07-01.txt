[14278] <ornament> First:
[14279] <prose> Although natural expression appears as light,
[14280] <break> <prose> Recognizing that one's own face is awareness-resonance inseparable from the single expanse, the primordially pure clarity-emptiness crystal-clear nature—this decisive cutting is introduction to the ultimate liberation ground, directly revealing naked View.
[14281] <break> <ornament> Second:
[14282] <prose> Within that very nature, without deliberate placement or abandonment, decisively cutting through natural meditative stability, neither distracted nor grasping—this is meditation.
[14283] <ornament> Third:
[14284] <prose> At that time, awareness naturally lucent, beyond meditation object and meditator, liberated as it arises, having confidence in self-liberation without rejecting good or bad conceptual constructs, to be repeated—
[14285] <prose> the first crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[14286] <prose> Although the natural realm appears variously, beyond mere appearance,
[14287] <prose> Gathering self-lucid naked pristine cognition into unified vastness, reciting it as self-lucid self-arisen pristine cognition and meditating thus, || 10 ||
[14288] <prose> even grasping at that is liberated.
[14289] <prose> Furthermore, there is nothing else:
[14290] <prose> This is the quintessential instruction for liberating light-appearance into Dharma-nature,
[14291] <prose> Introducing the nature of awareness instantly naked, outwardly looking yet inwardly lucid—
[14292] <prose> Looking at appearances, they are infinite, — yet.
[14293] <prose> Looking at awareness, not even one exists, naturally lucent self-arisen;
[14294] <break> <prose> the pith instruction of striking liberation ground directly.
[14295] <break> <prose> The second crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[14296] <ornament> Regarding compassion's vital point:
[14297] <prose> When awareness as means to guide manifold outward disciples radiates in various forms inwardly, || 20 ||
[14298] <prose> Do not cut the trail of outward radiation;
[14299] <break> <prose> Do not examine your own face;
[14300] <break> <prose> Without inward rejection, leave whatever arises resting just there;
[14301] <prose> By recognizing that uninterrupted knowing nakedly naturally lucent,
[14302] <prose> Liberation ground is directly revealed;
[14303] <prose> Wherein, by recognizing this very instantaneous naturally resolved awareness, continuously naked without transition, together with bardo consciousness manifesting unceasingly,
[14304] <prose> Primordially pure compassionate awareness is recognized and liberated—
[14305] <prose> the third crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[14306] <prose> These three are secret heart-nectar, supremely refined essence, utterly secret,
[14307] <prose> Greatly decisive in oral transmission, || 30 ||
[14308] <tantra> Greatly binding in Sutra and Tantra,
[14309] <prose> Vitally important in profound crucial points,
[14310] <break> <prose> The quintessential instruction of heart-sons supreme, sealing secrecy from others.
[14311] <break> <tantra> This is self-attained from the Vajra Realm of the Tantra;
[14312] <break> <prose> Although self-realizing many such points, explaining to others they will not understand;
[14313] <break> <prose> Showing, they will not realize;
[14314] <prose> Returning and dissolving into oneself, like rivers flowing into the ocean then dissolving therein.
[14315] <prose> Aligning the three vital points with scripture:
[14316] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[14317] <prose> Furthermore, the entity of Dharma-nature, || 40 ||
[14318] <break> <prose> Established as entity from self-nature itself,
[14319] <break> <prose> Since manner of appearance is uncertainly one,
[14320] <prose> Paths of entry are also different.
[14321] <prose> Through face, knowing, and liberation sight,
[14322] <prose> Entry, seeing, and familiarity,
[14323] <prose> Knowing the face is one's own face;
[14324] <prose> Confidence is the heart ground.
[14325] <prose> Decisive cutting enters into confidence;
[14326] <prose> Thus through these three, the certain deed:
[14327] <prose> Entity complete, cause ceases. || 50 ||
[14328] <prose> Furthermore, explaining Dharma-nature's nature:
[14329] <prose> Here, since not one but uncertain,
[14330] <prose> However imputed, thus appearing;
[14331] <tantra> From various naming bases,
[14332] <prose> Words and terms manifoldly proliferate;
[14333] <tantra> From uncertain various names,
[14334] <prose> Meanings too are empty of mere imputation;
[14335] <prose> Since emptiness is nowhere established,
[14336] <prose> Naturally pure thus appears.
[14337] <prose> Furthermore, explaining Dharma-nature compassion: || 60 ||
[14338] <prose> Since disciples' objects are manifold,
[14339] <prose> Guiding Bodies are also just so;
[14340] <tantra> From dispositions and faculties' displays,
[14341] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa cognitions differ;
[14342] <prose> When that itself is placed as respective objects,
[14343] <prose> The uncorrected meaning-intention.
[14344] <prose> Thus it is.
[14345] <prose> Second, fixing attention through crucial points of the three times:
[14346] <tantra> From the two—the realm of three times and the pith instruction of method—
[14347] <ornament> Regarding crucial points there are three: || 70 ||
[14348] <prose> The crucial point of knowing entry,
[14349] <prose> The crucial point of one's own face liberation,
[14350] <prose> The crucial point of recognizing face completion.
[14351] <ornament> First:
[14352] <prose> When awareness enters outward into luminosity-appearance, knowing resonance as self-appearance; and.
[14353] <prose> When light-appearance enters inward into awareness, knowing that nature inseparable from primordially pure ground, unmoving.
[14354] <ornament> Second:
[14355] <prose> At the time of applying the four pristine cognitions, knowing the crucial instruction of recognizing one's own face through liberation of outer, inner, and secret abiding in one's own face,
[14356] <break> <prose> Also, aggregates' self-grasping cleared, body liberated into luminosity, abiding in Dharma-nature own face,
[14357] <break> <prose> Liberated from elements' coarse subtle solidity, || 80 ||
[14358] <prose> Appearance abides in luminosity, great bliss,
[14359] <prose> Awareness, liberated from afflictions coarse subtle, dissolves into mother abiding.
[14360] <prose> Also, outer delusion purified, awareness meets Dharma-nature mother and knows, conditions manifoldly appearing as objects, things coarse subtle liberated, mother-child non-dual liberation.
[14361] <prose> How is liberation?
[14362] <prose> Earth element's characteristic self-purified, body freed from flesh-bondage;
[14363] <break> <prose> Water purified, blood;
[14364] <break> <prose> Fire purified, warmth;
[14365] <prose> Wind purified, freed from breath-bondage—
[14366] <prose> Without conceptual horse,
[14367] <prose> Flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated; || 90 ||
[14368] <prose> Inner awareness without affliction stain, five pristine cognitions self-appear;
[14369] <prose> Without knowable stain, phenomena and Dharma-nature non-dual,
[14370] <prose> Knowing one's own face thus abiding,
[14371] <prose> Now awareness cannot produce afflictions,
[14372] <prose> Liberated from saṃsāra karmic ripening;
[14373] <prose> Since afflictions cannot abide in awareness own face,
[14374] <prose> Secret awareness Dharma-nature, neither existent nor non-existent, neither eternal nor nihilistic, thing nor emptiness—falling into neither extreme,
[14375] <prose> Outer phenomena object and subject,
[14376] <prose> Inner phenomena variously grasping conceptual discrimination,
[14377] <prose> Secret phenomena awareness itself—without even slightest grasping, knowing one's own face. || 100 ||
[14378] <prose> Third, the crucial point of recognizing face completion:
[14379] <prose> Bodhicitta cannot actually descend.
[14380] <prose> Awareness arriving at the spontaneous precious jewel's own object, abiding inseparable from primordial purity and spontaneous presence, recognizing that,
[14381] <prose> All samsaric phenomena purified at that time, decisively cutting prior delusion never experienced,
[14382] <prose> Now obtaining the Body of no-return delusion impossible, awareness itself without turning back,
[14383] <prose> saṃsāra's delusory appearance,
[14384] <prose> nirvāṇa's pure appearance dissolving into Expanse, when neither existence nor non-existence, eternal nor nihilistic established anywhere, alternating saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, ground liberation attained—at the time of spontaneous dissolution, recognize.
[14385] <prose> This is awareness own face's vital importance.
[14386] <ornament> Second, regarding method's pith instruction, from two:
[14387] <prose> The previous pith instruction's crucial points familiarized and introduced in this life, recognizing outwardly inwardly as previously known, at that time liberated without doubt; || 110 ||
[14388] <break> <prose> Hence, this time's pith instruction: sharp awareness transcending ground from the start, like a shooting star racing through space, recognizing own face instantly and liberated;
[14389] <break> <prose> Dull awareness not recognizing various appearances' distinctions, through the power of previously practiced profundity,
[14390] <prose> Lion-cub freed from womb-enclosure, purifying solidity, liberated in whichever of twenty-one faculties' five or more instants.
[14391] <prose> These from Sun Moon Union:
[14392] <prose> This time has three:
[14393] <prose> Time of entry,
[14394] <prose> Time of liberation,
[14395] <prose> Time of completion.
[14396] <prose> Time of entry has two:
[14397] <break> <prose> Awareness entering outward into light, || 120 ||
[14398] <break> <prose> Light entering inward into awareness.
[14399] <prose> Liberation has three:
[14400] <prose> Awareness freed from elements through separation from conditions;
[14401] <prose> Awareness without stain,
[14402] <prose> Liberated from afflictions;
[14403] <prose> Awareness itself not falling into any extreme, liberated from outer and inner phenomena.
[14404] <prose> Completion is shown as awareness itself, all phenomena's appearance, liberated simultaneously.
[14405] <prose> Methods are two:
[14406] <prose> Previous pith instruction's crucial point,
[14407] <prose> This time's sharp and dull awareness distinction, thus. || 130 ||
[14408] <prose> Third, gathering meaning through self-appearance faculties' liberation mode, threefold:
[14409] <prose> Faculties' divisions generally shown,
[14410] <prose> Liberation-delusion stages specifically explained,
[14411] <prose> Individual faculties' liberation mode extensively spoken.
[14412] <ornament> First: Faculties sharp, dull, medium, combined lowest,
[14413] <prose> medium,
[14414] <prose> excellent,
[14415] <prose> peak,
[14416] <prose> supreme,
[14417] <prose> utmost, || 140 ||
[14418] <prose> complete—seven each, making twenty-one,
[14419] <prose> Each pristine cognition appearance mode,
[14420] <prose> Each delusion basis of aspect,
[14421] <prose> Each realization measure,
[14422] <prose> Each knowledge examination mode,
[14423] <prose> Each self-appearance liberation mode—separately arising,
[14424] <prose> Thus faculties explained as twenty-one,
[14425] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[14426] <break> <verse> Listen, devoted assembly!
[14427] <break> <verse> To dispel sentient beings' ignorance, || 150 ||
[14428] <verse> Since twenty-one appearance modes exist,
[14429] <break> <verse> These I teach—attend with care.
[14430] <break> <prose> Faculties shown through three aspects:
[14431] <list> Excellent,
[14432] <list> Medium,
[14433] <list> Excellent has seven:
[14434] <list> Excellent lowest,
[14435] <list> Excellent medium,
[14436] <list> Excellent excellent,
[14437] <list> Excellent supreme, || 160 ||
[14438] <list> Excellent utmost,
[14439] <list> Excellent peak,
[14440] <list> Excellent complete.
[14441] <prose> These are excellent's divisions.
[14442] <prose> These too have view-reversal each,
[14443] <prose> Pristine cognition appearance arising mode each,
[14444] <prose> Realization measure each,
[14445] <prose> Understanding time each,
[14446] <prose> Knowledge examination mode each arising, stability obtained in respective appearance.
[14447] <prose> Medium also has seven: || 170 ||
[14448] <list> Medium lowest,
[14449] <list> Medium medium,
[14450] <list> Medium excellent,
[14451] <list> Medium supreme,
[14452] <list> Medium utmost,
[14453] <list> Medium peak,
[14454] <list> Medium complete;
[14455] <prose> Each also pristine cognition arising measure arises.
[14456] <prose> These are medium's.
[14457] <prose> Lowest also seven: || 180 ||
[14458] <list> Lowest lowest,
[14459] <list> Lowest medium,
[14460] <list> Lowest excellent,
[14461] <list> Lowest supreme,
[14462] <list> Lowest utmost,
[14463] <list> Lowest peak,
[14464] <list> Lowest complete, thus.
[14465] <prose> Second, specifically explaining liberation-delusion stages:
[14466] <tantra> From Sun Moon Union:
[14467] <prose> Some obtain stability distinctly in the twenty-one faculties; || 190 ||
[14468] <prose> Therefore, those not comprehending their own knowledge, again without guru's oral transmission, become bewildered at that appearance,
[14469] <prose> Astonished,
[14470] <prose> Frightened,
[14471] <prose> Terrified,
[14472] <prose> Losing recognition, and so forth—
[14473] <prose> Again grasping saṃsāra's near appropriation,
[14474] <prose> Also twenty-one faculties distinctly deluded exist.
[14475] <prose> Thus the three faculties:
[14476] <prose> Excellent liberate in three instants;
[14477] <prose> Medium may obtain stability in five days; || 200 ||
[14478] <prose> Twenty-one instants obtain stability.
[14479] <prose> Lowest, expiring into natural Emanation-Body pure land, without bardo attain buddhahood, thus.
[14480] <break> <prose> Here three:
[14481] <break> <list> Twenty-one faculties delusion mode,
[14482] <list> Liberation mode,
[14483] <list> Dispelling delusion regarding distinction mode.
[14484] <ornament> First:
[14485] <prose> Those not seeing this teaching's door through previous guru's great secret certain oral transmission, and.
[14486] <prose> Those seen yet lacking confidence,
[14487] <prose> Laziness, || 210 ||
[14488] <prose> Distracted—lowest of lowest faculties, not obtaining power over Dharma-nature bardo self-appearance, greatly bewildered,
[14489] <prose> Not finding certainty, greatly appearing,
[14490] <verse> "From what ancestry did this arise?" thinking,
[14491] <break> <prose> Face not meeting, innermost frightened, thinking,
[14492] <break> <prose> Not previously practicing even an instant directly, "What is this appearance? Is it faculty delusion?" recognition perversely arising, and so forth—
[14493] <prose> Not recognizing self-appearance, again grasping saṃsāra's near appropriation existence-bardo,
[14494] <prose> Twenty-one faculties delusion exist.
[14495] <prose> How deluded?
[14496] <prose> When seeing great appearance,
[14497] <prose> Lowest lowest, outwardly grasping all as object-aspect, deluded; || 220 ||
[14498] <prose> Lowest medium, attachment's fault deluded;
[14499] <prose> Lowest excellent, self-grasping immediately as condition, deluded;
[14500] <prose> Lowest supreme, grasping self-characteristic as mark, deluded;
[14501] <prose> Lowest utmost, not knowing anywhere, deluded by bewildered ignorance;
[14502] <prose> Lowest peak, "What is this?" thinking, doubt entering, deluded;
[14503] <prose> Lowest complete, grasping that itself as object's portion self, deluded;
[14504] <prose> Medium lowest, seeing lucidity as empty of thing, deluded;
[14505] <prose> Medium medium, grasping thing attachment-grasping as heart essence, deluded;
[14506] <prose> Medium excellent, distracted in object, not knowing anywhere, deluded by child-seeing-appearance ignorance;
[14507] <prose> Medium supreme, making knowledge grasping condition, deluded; || 230 ||
[14508] <prose> Medium utmost, examined as grasped object, deluded;
[14509] <prose> Medium peak, grasping "Such appearance arose to me" as hope-fear, deluded;
[14510] <prose> Medium complete, placing in certainty, not knowing self-appearance, deluded;
[14511] <prose> Excellent lowest, grasping as beautiful, deluded;
[14512] <prose> Excellent medium, grasping attachment to beauty, deluded;
[14513] <prose> Excellent excellent, not grasping anywhere yet distracted, without recognition, deluded;
[14514] <prose> Excellent supreme, appearance's object making cause-self one grasping, deluded;
[14515] <prose> Excellent utmost, not knowing instantaneous change aspect, deluded;
[14516] <prose> Excellent peak, grasping signs and marks as formed, deluded;
[14517] <prose> Excellent complete, not knowing anywhere, deluded by appearance force or bewilderment. || 240 ||
[14518] <prose> All delusion modes, twenty-one included here,
[14519] <prose> Not deluding in bardo is extremely precious.
[14520] <ornament> Also regarding this, now outer ordinary appearance and.
[14521] <prose> Luminosity portion self-appearance, instant by instant nakedly each recognizing—extremely precious.
[14522] <prose> Also from Self-Arisen:
[14523] <break> <verse> Listen, nearby assembly!
[14524] <break> <verse> Sentient beings in bardo delude thus:
[14525] <verse> Some delude from aspect,
[14526] <verse> Some delude from experience,
[14527] <verse> Some delude from immediacy, || 250 ||
[14528] <verse> Some delude from fixation,
[14529] <break> <verse> Some delude from "what is this?" thinking,
[14530] <break> <verse> Some delude from thought-construct,
[14531] <verse> Some delude from object; some delude from no-object;
[14532] <verse> Some delude from heart essence,
[14533] <verse> Some delude from ignorance,
[14534] <verse> Some delude from conditions,
[14535] <verse> Some delude from examination,
[14536] <verse> Some delude from self,
[14537] <verse> Some delude from not recognizing face, || 260 ||
[14538] <verse> Some delude from grasping,
[14539] <verse> Some delude from no-grasping,
[14540] <verse> Some delude from recognition,
[14541] <verse> Some delude from cause,
[14542] <verse> Some delude from instant,
[14543] <verse> Some delude from signs,
[14544] <verse> Some delude from force.
[14545] <prose> Since bardo sentient beings' minds are twenty-one,
[14546] <prose> One delusion mode completes appearance,
[14547] <prose> Thus for each delusion mode, appearance arises; || 270 ||
[14548] <prose> Thus extensively shown, bardo delusion modes, thus.
[14549] <prose> Second, liberation mode does not transcend twenty-one faculty stages,
[14550] <prose> Not transcending excellent, medium, lowest three.
[14551] <prose> Here excellent three instants,
[14552] <prose> Medium five,
[14553] <prose> Lowest seven to twenty-one liberated.
[14554] <prose> Their lowest cannot liberate from birth in natural Emanation pure land.
[14555] <prose> Excellent complete liberates in primordial purity in three instants.
[14556] <tantra> From Blazing Relic Body:
[14557] <verse> Shooting stars through space, || 280 ||
[14558] <verse> Racing mode, three instants,
[14559] <verse> Even with Emanation itself,
[14560] <verse> Into own-entity self-dissolved.
[14561] <prose> Thus.
[14562] <prose> Excellent remaining six actions complete in three instants, complete.
[14563] <prose> Faculty distinction: instant duration long-short exists,
[14564] <prose> Some take from one to six days of meditative stability.
[14565] <prose> Completion does not depend on days from three liberation instants.
[14566] <prose> This arises from realization's potency.
[14567] <prose> Liberation instant: when knowledge arises at appearance, abiding there, object-known duration counted as one instant, three instants liberated. || 290 ||
[14568] <prose> Medium and.
[14569] <prose> Lowest instants longer than that,
[14570] <prose> Calculating action-complete instant, now explained.
[14571] <prose> Third, dispelling delusion regarding distinction:
[14572] <prose> Delusion and.
[14573] <prose> Its dispelling, from two:
[14574] <ornament> Delusion regarding portion: many tantras and pith instructions, some three instants,
[14575] <list> Five,
[14576] <list> Some three days,
[14577] <list> Twenty-one and so forth explained, not distinguishing meditative stability days and || 300 ||
[14578] <prose> Liberation instants, grasping two as one, explained.
[14579] <prose> Dispelling from two:
[14580] <prose> Reasoning:
[14581] <prose> If those two were one, excellent peak subject would be liberated in one instant,
[14582] <prose> Because liberated in one day of meditative stability;
[14583] <prose> If accepting, excellent three instants liberated is clear.
[14584] <prose> Likewise excellent lowest would be liberated in six instants,
[14585] <prose> Because liberated in six days.
[14586] <prose> If accepting, excellent whichever, three instants liberated is clear.
[14587] <prose> Also liberating in interval passage time's primordial purity, — yet three instants certain, || 310 ||
