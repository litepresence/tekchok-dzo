[635] <tantra> From the south-eastern direction of this world system,
[636] <prose> Beyond the six transcendent realms,
[637] <prose> The realm called Thal-ba resounds:
[638] <prose> Protectors and benefactors completely surround it,
[639] <prose> Victory banners, parasols, and royal insignia raised on high,
[640] <prose> Flowers of many kinds, fragrant rains, and perfumes descend,
[641] <prose> Upon the Teacher himself and upon his teachings,
[642] <prose> The assembly of beautifying goddesses and their reflections encircle them,
[643] <prose> And the play of bliss naturally arises.
[644] <tantra> From the south-western direction of this world, || 10 ||
[645] <tantra> From below the six transcendent realms, the wind of Thal-ba,
[646] <prose> Moves and stirs throughout the intermediate space,
[647] <prose> Moving in mutual embrace, hovering,
[648] <prose> And from this movement all sounds arise.
[649] <prose> The Teacher's teachings are moved by this wind,
[650] <prose> Through the three gateways of those possessing the five elements.
[651] <prose> Upon that summit, thirteen are stacked together—
[652] <prose> The Jewel Thal-ba, as it is called,
[653] <prose> Adorned with auspicious rays of the sun,
[654] <prose> And ornamented with the qualities of desire. || 20 ||
[655] <prose> Miraculous letters and beautiful script,
[656] <prose> The Teacher's teachings—complete in reflection.
[657] <prose> Beautiful through the lotus eyes of Lda-ldi,
[658] <tantra> From this, the summit of the western-northern threshold.
[659] <prose> The sixth world-system,
[660] <prose> The Taming Thal-ba, as it is called.
[661] <prose> Together with goddesses making complete offerings,
[662] <prose> Filled with light and the fragrance of sandalwood,
[663] <prose> The Teacher's teachings—equal in every portion.
[664] <prose> Possessing beautiful forms of sixteen years, || 30 ||
[665] <prose> Surrounded by those in the bloom of youth.
[666] <prose> Below that, in the ninth world,
[667] <prose> The deity called Dung-ldan Thal-ba,
[668] <prose> Intoxicated by the fragrance of faith and protection,
[669] <prose> Turbulent, with extremely blazing light,
[670] <prose> Agitated, glowing with fierce intensity.
[671] <prose> The Teacher himself, his teachings,
[672] <prose> And his retinue—complete enjoyment.
[673] <tantra> From this, the sixth world,
[674] <prose> The Star Thal-ba, as it is called. || 40 ||
[675] <prose> The nature of the stacked wheel,
[676] <prose> Completely stacked by fives and nines.
[677] <prose> Adorned with the water-spouts of dawn,
[678] <prose> Thunder, lightning, and red tongues emerge.
[679] <prose> The Teacher's teachings are surrounded by scripture,
[680] <prose> The light-arising garland—lineage of the nāgas.
[681] <prose> Illuminating all directions and thresholds.
[682] <prose> Thus.
[683] <prose> And in all those upper and lower thresholds of the twenty-five stacked lotus-abiding ones, countless fields pervade all upper and lower directions and thresholds.
[684] <prose> Like scattered stars. || 50 ||
[685] <prose> Thus from immeasurable fields,
[686] <prose> The sequence of this Sahā world is explained:
[687] <tantra> From that itself:
[688] <prose> External elements arise from wind as well,
[689] <prose> Connected with the space element,
[690] <prose> Upon which rests water, and above that earth.
[691] <prose> In extent, breadth, and thickness equal,
[692] <break> <prose> One hundred-thousand and four countless,
[693] <break> <prose> One of which is four portions empty.
[694] <prose> The arrangement of continents and Mount Meru, || 60 ||
[695] <prose> Together with the wish-fulfilling tree and the jewel,
[696] <prose> The individual gods of sun and moon,
[697] <prose> Surrounded by the great ocean's method.
[698] <prose> Mountain ranges and water ranges,
[699] <prose> All definitely surrounded by seven jewels.
[700] <prose> Internally, thus from the first formless realm,
[701] <prose> The form realm is luminosity:
[702] <prose> In the distance, the desire realm as well,
[703] <prose> The stainless moon and
[704] <prose> The greatly illuminating sun, || 70 ||
[705] <prose> The world-systems expanded,
[706] <prose> Paranirmitavaśavartin and so forth in upper sequence.
[707] <prose> Then the abodes of asuras,
[708] <prose> The sequence of humans in the four continents.
[709] <prose> By kleśas together with self,
[710] <prose> The abodes of lower realms arise in sequence.
[711] <prose> Thus.
[712] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland Tantra:
[713] <tantra> In space, wind supports that water,
[714] <tantra> By eleven hundred-thousands, || 80 ||
[715] <tantra> Round and coiled, itself arisen.
[716] <tantra> Like cream arising from milk,
[717] <tantra> Earth is twelve hundred-thousands.
[718] <tantra> Wind's number is one hundred-thousand.
[719] <tantra> The wind gathers and contracts,
[720] <tantra> Pulls and lifts.
[721] <tantra> Water pervades and holds,
[722] <tantra> Ripens—these three.
[723] <tantra> Earth rubs subtle and
[724] <tantra> Coarse itself—these three. || 90 ||
[725] <tantra> Like that which is churned down below,
[726] <tantra> Among mountains, the king of mountains is:
[727] <tantra> Four terraces and great peaks,
[728] <tantra> Seven sporting lakes and seven mountains,
[729] <tantra> Continents and the surrounding rim arisen.
[730] <tantra> The three-thousand and so forth world-systems.
[731] <tantra> By desire, form, and formless,
[732] <tantra> These three realms are supported there.
[733] <tantra> The formless realm, without any existence,
[734] <tantra> Without even slight consciousness, || 100 ||
[735] <tantra> Arisen from that.
[736] <tantra> The pure abodes and so forth embodied,
[737] <tantra> From upper to lower in drops manner.
[738] <tantra> Akanistha and so forth of desire.
[739] <tantra> Gods, asuras, and humans:
[740] <tantra> High, then from that the three abodes,
[741] <tantra> Animals, pretas, and hell—
[742] <tantra> These four kinds of birth for beings.
[743] <tantra> That also, the humans of the first fortunate eon,
[744] <tantra> Possessing form, youth, and marks of beauty, || 110 ||
[745] <tantra> Their bodies pervaded by their own light's radiance,
[746] <tantra> Desire-food and so forth as merit-food.
[747] <tantra> The life of beings also eighty-thousand,
[748] <tantra> Without male and female faculties.
[749] <tantra> Then from the two causes of delusion,
[750] <tantra> Kleśas of desire and so forth,
[751] <tantra> Gradually became coarse.
[752] <tantra> The faculties and so forth gates,
[753] <tantra> Light and so forth decrease, for merit is exhausted.
[754] <tantra> Then in sequence, earth oil and || 120 ||
[755] <tantra> Sālu rice and so forth as food.
[756] <tantra> Thus and so forth taught.
[757] <prose> Here that meaning is slightly shown definitively:
[758] <prose> Known from common sūtras and treatises, and
[759] <tantra> Although much taught from uncommon Tantra-sections regarding measure and arrangement,
[760] <prose> Here it is explained like the unsurpassed Vajra-peak vehicle.
[761] <tantra> From the Great Array of Ati, arising like that, the meaning of entity-abiding established without mistake:
[762] <tantra> In the space included within the category of Brahma-great's field,
[763] <tantra> The fields abiding as twenty-five stacked three-thousand; upon the center's layers of Gang-chen-tsho's hand-lotus,
[764] <tantra> Are called the field ornamented by basis and essence with flowers, || 130 ||
[765] <tantra> From inside that, to the arrangement of this Sahā world-system, the thirteenth secret-mantra vajra-vehicle field abiding at the glorious center's heart,
[766] <tantra> The arising of the first fortunate eon,
[767] <tantra> The abiding in the middle,
[768] <tantra> The destruction at the end,
[769] <tantra> The final emptying—these four should be known.
[770] <prose> First, arising: the container and
[771] <prose> The sequence of the essence, the sequence of the first arising of the container is:
[772] <tantra> From the side of this, below from the passed twenty intermediate fortunate eons after the previously arisen world became empty,
[773] <prose> In empty space where five-colored seeds of elements not clear, — yet capable of arising,
[774] <prose> In the upper direction, the formless realm called object-possessor of grasping consciousness; possessing portions of arising element seeds; arisen like essences upper-arisen in drops manner. || 140 ||
[775] <prose> In the lower direction, the manner of arising below like the terrace of a caitya is:
[776] <prose> The time of the first arising of container-contained,
[777] <prose> The lower basis called completely mind-joy, space possessing white color and white light,
[778] <prose> In the appearance of extremely white terraces,
[779] <prose> The seed E triangle, clear space supporting this three-thousand world, arisen.
[780] <tantra> From that space; from the wind pervading, entering, and protecting called seed A; from the sound called Uṃ proclaimed three times:
[781] <prose> Namely, the wind of variously-stopping,
[782] <prose> Merely rises as the breath of a striped mouse,
[783] <tantra> From gathered like mist or cloud-mass in sky,
[784] <prose> Marked by yaṃ at the navel, similar to the shape of various vajra-crosses, || 150 ||
[785] <prose> Four wind goddesses holding wind banners,
[786] <prose> Blazing various colored lights,
[787] <prose> Similar to the form of Indra-nila, green wind element,
[788] <prose> Formed vast and thick in height,
[789] <prose> Demonstrating power of raising and not rising until the eon,
[790] <prose> Four iron sows flung from four tips of vajra-cross,
[791] <prose> Depth of that wind: one hundred-thousand eight thousand leagues,
[792] <prose> Width: sixty hundred-thousand four hundred-thousand formed.
[793] <prose> Then forms called water's water thoroughly established:
[794] <tantra> From gathered gold-essence clouds in upper sky, || 160 ||
[795] <tantra> From fell stream of rain for seven years,
[796] <prose> To clear, unmoving, unturbid water, round shape similar to full moon,
[797] <prose> Formed with countless dancing water goddesses, depth eleven hundred-thousand twenty thousand leagues,
[798] <prose> Width three hundred-thousand five thousand leagues formed.
[799] <prose> Then at one intermediate eon, from below wind mandala,
[800] <tantra> From arose possessing thoroughly pressing sound, called stopping-doing wind,
[801] <prose> Arose roaring sound floating upward from lower sky,
[802] <tantra> From all mixed as one, wind and water etc. moved upward,
[803] <prose> Formed five thousand leagues gold ground like cream formed on milk, above water.
[804] <prose> Above that, called forming-doing earth's earth, formed five thousand measure from spread countless atoms. || 170 ||
[805] <prose> Above that, called time earth's fire, formed two hundred-thousand leagues from spread countless atoms.
[806] <prose> Then called separating-doing wind.
[807] <tantra> From arisen like waves from ocean,
[808] <prose> Fell countless wind atoms from upper sky,
[809] <prose> Like example of snow fell in space.
[810] <prose> That itself formed one hundred-thousand leagues.
[811] <prose> Above that, called hollow-making earth's sky, blue like turquoise radiance,
[812] <prose> By fell countless sky atoms from sky,
[813] <prose> Those gathered as one,
[814] <prose> By action of doing nature, || 180 ||
[815] <prose> Like silk formed on ocean,
[816] <prose> Expanded and evenly flat,
[817] <prose> Four-cornered shape,
[818] <prose> Held by four earth goddesses holding four gold vases from four corners,
[819] <prose> Held by four powerful naga sons from four sides.
[820] <break> <prose> That also height four hundred-thousand ten-thousand leagues.
[821] <break> <prose> These element mandalas also
[822] <prose> Formed supported one on one like stupa tiers.
[823] <tantra> From sutra, these between-between sky also explained demarcated intervals each that much measure of upper leagues.
[824] <tantra> From Vajra-peak world arrangement, || 190 ||
[825] <prose> Between water and earth also called sky mind-protecting,
[826] <prose> Fire mandala depth one thousand leagues, raised by five thousand leagues, in center,
[827] <prose> Width five hundred-thousand,
[828] <prose> Possessing red light,
[829] <prose> Said to exist as action of ripening common elements.
[830] <prose> That also did action pervaded by earth's water,
[831] <prose> Showing distinction of beings' action.
[832] <prose> Ripened by earth's fire,
[833] <prose> Beings' body's color clear.
[834] <prose> Made atom by earth's wind, || 200 ||
[835] <prose> Make beings' sense-powers complete.
[836] <prose> Did action opened aperture by earth's sky,
[837] <prose> Make beings' mind abide.
[838] <prose> Pressed by earth's earth,
[839] <prose> Make beings' action and merit show.
[840] <prose> These called vessel benefits essence.
[841] <prose> Then again from below called ripening action wind.
[842] <prose> Shape and color like gold wheel's thousand empty spokes,
[843] <prose> Arose possessing power moved by nature,
[844] <tantra> From stirred all earth and water mandalas, || 210 ||
[845] <prose> Like example of butter arisen from churned milk or curd,
[846] <prose> Dust impurity went to gold, went to depth by heavy, formed ground base,
[847] <prose> Center Meru elevated upward hundred-thousand sixty ten-thousand leagues, floated clear above,
[848] <prose> Also inserted that much downward to gold ground,
[849] <prose> Combined three hundred-thousand twenty-thousand leagues.
[850] <tantra> From some Tantra,
[851] <prose> Also explained inserted downward ten-thousand four thousand leagues.
[852] <prose> That Meru's east formed from silver,
[853] <prose> South baiḍūrya,
[854] <break> <prose> West padma rāga, || 220 ||
[855] <break> <prose> North formed from gold, direction sky's radiance harmonious with these.
[856] <prose> That Meru from gold ground elevated, half eighty-thousand leagues below water submerged,
[857] <prose> Below half above, four stacked tiers remain, lower wind tier called turquoise vajra-possessing, turquoise vajra inserted,
[858] <prose> That also width eighty-thousand leagues, equal distance with water,
[859] <prose> Elevated outward sixteen thousand from Meru,
[860] <prose> Height three-times all equal,
[861] <prose> Summit one upward ten ten-thousand leagues exist.
[862] <prose> Second tier is:
[863] <prose> Above that, formed from water, called tier lotus variously-stacked,
[864] <prose> Crystal nature blazing light, || 230 ||
[865] <prose> Elevated outward eight thousand leagues from Meru.
[866] <prose> Above that in third tier, formed from gold, called wheel variously-stacked,
[867] <prose> Elevated outward four thousand leagues from Meru.
[868] <prose> Above that in fourth tier, called jewel light-blazing,
[869] <prose> Formed from coral, radiating red like fire light,
[870] <prose> Make showing limit of rain fall and not-fall by beings' action.
[871] <prose> Elevated outward two-thousand leagues from Meru.
[872] <prose> These seven sporting lakes outer, seven gold mountains, circling four corners all directions, seven mountains.
[873] <prose> Inside from sequence:
[874] <prose> Yoke-holder, || 240 ||
[875] <prose> Plow-arrow-holder,
[876] <prose> Acacia-possessing,
[877] <prose> Beautiful-to-see,
[878] <prose> Horse-ear,
[879] <prose> Prostrate,
[880] <prose> Rim-holder—these from water-interval upward surpassing's portion:
[881] <prose> Yojana forty-thousand,
[882] <prose> Twenty-thousand,
[883] <prose> Five-thousand,
[884] <prose> Two-thousand five-hundred, || 250 ||
[885] <prose> Thousand and half and three-hundred,
[886] <prose> Six-hundred twenty-five.
[887] <prose> Width:
[888] <prose> Individual portion from how-much surpassing, that-much each exists.
[889] <prose> These interval in eight lakes surrounding exist,
[890] <prose> Great nāgas eight eon-playing outer-playing's lake called.
[891] <prose> Play-lake first's width: yojana thousand eighty,
