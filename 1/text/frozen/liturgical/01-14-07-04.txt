[19421] <ornament> Second: Regarding appearances as continuums of light-rays:
[19422] <prose> From these appearances arise the subtle,
[19423] <prose> The moving,
[19424] <prose> The wriggling,
[19425] <prose> The flickering,
[19426] <prose> And blazing manifestations.
[19427] <ornament> Third: They dawn within the circle of the bindu.
[19428] <prose> From that: upright standing appearances,
[19429] <prose> And spokes eastward and so forth also arise.
[19430] <ornament> Third: The bindus of self-ripened result are three: || 19430 ||
[19431] <prose> From the sun-moon mouth-union,
[19432] <prose> The bindus of self-ripened result are three:
[19433] <list> The bindu of ripened lights,
[19434] <list> The bindu of ripened pristine cognition,
[19435] <list> And the bindu of ripened awareness—thus it is proclaimed.
[19436] <prose> From that nature:
[19437] <prose> The bindu of ripened lights abides standing upright,
[19438] <prose> Extremely clear and unmixed like a rainbow.
[19439] <prose> When accustomed to this, appearances are also seen.
[19440] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 19440 ||
