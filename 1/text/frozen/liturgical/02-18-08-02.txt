[5035] <prose> Second: extend the session, extending duration;
[5036] <prose> Third: without day or night, take experience,
[5037] <prose> Place awareness in dhātu's fence, make unmoving.
[5038] <tantra> From Blazing Lamp:
[5039] <verse> Dhātu makes awareness's self-field;
[5040] <verse> Vajra itself is hanging-cord;
[5041] <verse> Make place this inside.
[5042] <verse> Thus it was said.
[5043] <prose> Fruit is:
[5044] <prose> When outer dhātu-vision, eye unmoving, self time; || 10 ||
[5045] <prose> Inner: awareness abiding in base, cause resonance to dissolve from self, circling;
[5046] <prose> Separated from lung wind horse cause;
[5047] <prose> Wisdom sky dissolves into dhātu sky, cause equal limitless liberation;
[5048] <prose> Pure awareness, unmoving in dhātu, abides in nature of luminous-clear intent, heart-in mode.
[5049] <prose> That yogin: called capturing original Dharmatā luminous-clear, from Saṃsāra name empty,
[5050] <prose> Three-realms corpse cut is. || 20 ||
[5051] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[5052] <verse> That Dharmatā direct main-point:
[5053] <verse> Know by seeing only,
[5054] <verse> And realize by that knowing,
[5055] <verse> Become liberated by realizing only.
[5056] <verse> Liberate called: not untie.
[5057] <verse> Sky in sky,
[5058] <verse> Dissolve nature not-aim cause,
[5059] <verse> Equal limitless, not possessing part. || 30 ||
[5060] <verse> Capacity-possess find direct:
[5061] <verse> Three-realms Saṃsāra name empty cause,
[5062] <verse> Three-realms corpse cut.
[5063] <verse> Thus it was said.
[5064] <prose> Second: from two—experience increasing above vision:
[5065] <prose> Briefly show:
[5066] <prose> Above, above purify dhātu awareness cause;
[5067] <prose> Outer: like non-dual abiding of awareness hanging-cord in dhātu-vision;
[5068] <prose> Inner: non-dual abiding of awareness dhātu, self-resonance in pure empty dhātu, || 40 ||
[5069] <prose> Cause luminous-clear mother-son mix; experience vision increases various.
[5070] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[5071] <verse> Experience vision increasing above is:
[5072] <verse> From wisdom color outer emerge,
[5073] <verse> Up-stand and wing dawn,
[5074] <verse> Various points, body itself,
[5075] <verse> Clear in coarse vision field. || 50 ||
[5076] <verse> Thus it was said.
[5077] <prose> Extensively explain: two are experience called experience increasing above—
[5078] <list> —Knowing experience,
[5079] <list> And vision experience.
[5080] <prose> Knowing experience: worldly knowing experience, samādhi-obtained pleasure happiness, mind desiring song, dance, and so forth, heart desire;
[5081] <prose> Transcend knowing experience—empty, clear, extreme separate, realize measure with discriminating-awareness potency.
[5082] <prose> This same: from habituation of first, middle, end—
[5083] <list> —Knowing pleasure happiness experience,
[5084] <list> End change experience, and vision experience, three arise.
