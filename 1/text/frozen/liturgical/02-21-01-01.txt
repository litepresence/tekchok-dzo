[9713] <ornament> First: These various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements of container-contents,
[9714] <break> <prose> Except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing,
[9715] <prose> And inner mind's thing, both not established,
[9716] <prose> Should understand as like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance, nature of clear-appear without base-without empty miracle.
[9717] <tantra> From Six Expanses:
[9718] <prose> All appearance is illusion,
[9719] <prose> Like dream and reflection.
[9720] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9721] <tantra> From Root Wisdom:
[9722] <prose> Like dream, like illusion, || 10 ||
[9723] <prose> Like gandharva city,
[9724] <break> <prose> Like-that arising and like-that abiding,
[9725] <break> <prose> Like-that also not destroyed. Thus it is spoken.
[9726] <prose> Appearing to mind whatever appears,
[9727] <prose> Like appearance to impure sense-power of eye-defect's hair-shadow.
[9728] <tantra> From that same source:
[9729] <prose> To mind itself existing as object,
[9730] <prose> Various appearances self-arise.
[9731] <prose> Name and color individually
[9732] <prose> Complete as two aspects of form. || 20 ||
[9733] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9734] <prose> Though appearing to mind, these outer-clear appearance manners are not self's mind,
[9735] <prose> Existing also without self,
[9736] <break> <prose> Abiding as field,
[9737] <break> <prose> Color,
[9738] <prose> Because seeing as shape etc.
[9739] <prose> Not mind because those do not exist in mind.
[9740] <prose> Here, giving introduction like dream delusion of clear-appear, not existing: these appearances of outer appearance fields like form etc.,
[9741] <verse> "This is form,"
[9742] <prose> Thinking color etc., arising-arising, first the appearance-field of arising, holding that is called "mind of appearance," || 30 ||
[9743] <prose> Called "mind of grasping,"
[9744] <prose> Having seized essence, called "mind of field."
[9745] <prose> Questioning if that mind of appearance exists: not true by holding clear-appear without field,
[9746] <prose> Also not existing by color not established as essence seize,
[9747] <prose> Also not existing by examining in three: arise, cease, abide.
[9748] <prose> Called "giving introduction of mind itself as empty,"
[9749] <prose> Give introduction as wisdom Buddha without self-dissolving place.
[9750] <prose> Therefore ordinary Dharma and
[9751] <prose> Great perfect ordinary's appearance,
[9752] <prose> Not separating appearance field, || 40 ||
[9753] <prose> Desiring outer appearance field self-characteristic as mind
[9754] <prose> Is mistake into odor-with various-true mind-only.
[9755] <prose> Here, at time of giving introduction of appearance as mind, mind holding as appear-not-appear,
[9756] <prose> Mind of appearance to mind first meeting field,
[9757] <break> <prose> After, examining that distinction as mental event, desiring called "mind of holding,"
[9758] <break> <prose> Called "saṃsāra: delusion-hold, delusion-appear, purify, abandon."
[9759] <prose> 
[9760] <prose> In two truths,
[9761] <prose> Of mind and mental-event, three realms',
[9762] <prose> Superimposing aspect is concept. || 50 ||
[9763] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9764] <tantra> From Treasury:
[9765] <verse> "Concept and examine coarse-subtle."
[9766] <prose> Thus explained as abandonment, entering together all meaning—this great essential point should be realized by those possessing supreme holy wisdom intelligence.
[9767] <prose> Also, need one like this for meeting baseless outer-inner.
[9768] <prose> Second, establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point:
[9769] <prose> When not seizing essence by examining mind,
[9770] <prose> Not becoming like inert,
[9771] <prose> Though declaring not knowing spread-spread clear without essence seize,
[9772] <prose> Give introduction as inner Dharma-space of Dharma-ceasing, arising primordially pure, stain-free space of self-clear empty self-tone manner, || 60 ||
[9773] <prose> Realization of limit-free, stain-free arises from within.
[9774] <prose> Seeing also secondary appearance of luminosity space-appear by familiarizing in that manner.
[9775] <tantra> From Introduction Ornament:
[9776] <prose> By empty not-existing from-beginning,
[9777] <prose> Element self-ceasing, light-appearance ray.
[9778] <prose> By empty free of action-agent,
[9779] <prose> Obtain light-appearance indicating three bodies.
[9780] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9781] <prose> Third, establishing supreme awareness by secret space's essential point:
[9782] <prose> That mind-pure empty in space is not mere empty extreme, || 70 ||
[9783] <prose> Clear — snap,
[9784] <prose> Give introduction to Dharmakaya free from stain, wisdom of awareness by individual self-clear self-clear.
[9785] <prose> Not going to extreme from awareness portion,
[9786] <prose> Not going to eternal by thing not-existing,
[9787] <prose> Placed in decided manner in great vast limit-free expanse of not-two-both and not-two-both by nowhere declaring.
[9788] <prose> Self-appear awareness self-tone nadi-thread with bindu.
[9789] <tantra> From that same source:
[9790] <prose> By awareness abiding in base,
[9791] <prose> Meet space of gathered Dharma-nature.
[9792] <prose> By awareness holding characteristic, || 80 ||
[9793] <prose> Meet pure complete space.
[9794] <prose> By nadi-thread awareness,
[9795] <prose> Meet light space of nature.
[9796] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9797] <prose> Thus giving introduction to baseless appearance field.
[9798] <prose> Transcend saṃsāra of appearance field's container-contents.
[9799] <prose> Giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9800] <prose> Knowing object of self-dissolving arise-liberate.
[9801] <prose> Giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9802] <prose> Cut root of grasp-hold delusion. || 90 ||
[9803] <prose> Giving introduction of empty as space-awareness,
[9804] <prose> Rolling experience of three bodies into one,
[9805] <prose> For obtaining perfect Buddha in one life,
[9806] <prose> Demonstrating introduction of delusion reversing manner from mind as very important.
[9807] <prose> By example introduction:
[9808] <prose> Meaning of wisdom of awareness existing in self,
[9809] <prose> Demonstrating sign confidence by awakening mind's lamp.
[9810] <tantra> From that same source:
[9811] <prose> Holding measure of all Buddhas,
[9812] <prose> Examine example wisdoms. || 100 ||
[9813] <prose> Holding measure of sign wisdom,
[9814] <break> <prose> Examine lamp of empty bindu.
[9815] <break> <prose> Holding measure of meaning wisdom,
[9816] <break> <prose> Examine clear manifest appearance.
[9817] <break> <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9818] <prose> Briefly summarized:
[9819] <prose> Outer appearance field baseless,
[9820] <prose> Giving introduction of mind of holding that appearance as empty,
[9821] <prose> Knowing saṃsāra delusion as one groundless,
[9822] <prose> Not sufficient by that, || 110 ||
[9823] <prose> Giving introduction manifestly to meaning of root awareness, giving introduction without gathering-separation of space-awareness,
[9824] <prose> Instruction to supreme excellent intelligences: should deliver to primordially pure Dharmakaya.
[9825] <break> <prose> Second meaning: introduction of self-appear wisdom has two aspects:
[9826] <break> <prose> Distinction of sense-power of instruction object,
[9827] <prose> And sequence of instruction introduction.
[9828] <ornament> First:
[9829] <prose> Dividing best, middle, and last three sense-powers into sevens makes twenty-one.
[9830] <prose> Those all also: wisdom,
[9831] <prose> Purification,
[9832] <prose> Different liberation. || 120 ||
[9833] <prose> First, called "best":
[9834] <prose> Portion of wisdom and realization.
[9835] <prose> Also dividing that, seven:
[9836] <prose> Best's last and
[9837] <prose> Best's middle and
[9838] <prose> Best's best and
[9839] <break> <prose> Best's advanced and
[9840] <break> <prose> Best's supreme and
[9841] <break> <prose> Best's peak and
[9842] <break> <prose> Best's end reaching. || 130 ||
[9843] <prose> Placing those all from portion of easily realizing self-appear.
[9844] <prose> Also seven for middle:
[9845] <prose> Middle's last and
[9846] <break> <prose> Middle's middle and
[9847] <break> <prose> Middle's best and
[9848] <prose> Middle's advanced and
[9849] <prose> Middle's supreme and
[9850] <prose> Middle's peak and
[9851] <prose> Middle's end reaching.
[9852] <prose> Likewise, also seven for last: || 140 ||
[9853] <prose> Last's last and
[9854] <prose> Last's middle and
[9855] <prose> Last's best and
[9856] <prose> Last's supreme and
[9857] <prose> Last's advanced and
[9858] <prose> Last's peak and
[9859] <prose> Last's peak complete.
[9860] <break> <ornament> Second:
[9861] <break> <prose> Thus twenty-one sense-powers arise, twenty-one introductions also arise.
[9862] <prose> That also, from individually giving introduction, two: || 150 ||
[9863] <prose> Common distinction,
[9864] <prose> Distinct indicative manner.
[9865] <ornament> First:
[9866] <prose> To three: light, wisdom, awareness,
[9867] <prose> Giving introduction as seven groups.
[9868] <tantra> From Vajra-Mind Heart Mirror Tantra:
[9869] <prose> Awareness transcends from base,
[9870] <prose> Should know twenty-one introductions—example meaning introduction etc.—for making known entering path.
[9871] <prose> Snow or
[9872] <prose> Conch or || 160 ||
[9873] <break> <prose> One crystal without stain arising from ocean:
[9874] <break> <prose> Extend to window's appearance,
[9875] <prose> Five colors of light spontaneously arise.
[9876] <prose> Also, what are those?
[9877] <prose> Blue color and
[9878] <prose> White and
[9879] <prose> Yellow and
[9880] <prose> Red and
[9881] <prose> Green.
[9882] <prose> That person following one crystal: hold right eye with right hand, || 170 ||
[9883] <prose> Place on eye's top, appearance will be seen; block left eye with left hand.
[9884] <prose> That is example introduction.
[9885] <prose> Meaning thus abides in self's heart center.
[9886] <prose> That is meaning introduction.
[9887] <prose> Press eye with self's thumb, sign: bindu of light arises like fish eye.
[9888] <prose> That is sign introduction.
[9889] <prose> Dharmakaya introduction:

[9896] <break> <prose> 
[9897] <break> <prose> Giving introduction to emanation body:
[9898] <break> <prose> Make know essence: dharma-possessor appearing as sign is miracle of self-awareness.
[9899] <prose> Make know as mass of self's light rays on Dharma day.
[9900] <prose> Make know essence without abandoning this interior of concept habit-continuum.
[9901] <break> <prose> That is emanation body's introduction.
[9902] <prose> That root bind method introduction of appearance arising in self-manner. || 190 ||
[9903] <prose> Thus seven aspects called "light introduction."
[9904] <prose> What is wisdom's introduction?
[9905] <prose> Examining essence of copper vessel: introduction of Dharma space's wisdom.
[9906] <prose> Fill copper vessel well with water,
[9907] <prose> Place clear-making mirror on eye's top, look:
[9908] <prose> Bindu and
[9909] <prose> Arising as bindu particle manner,
[9910] <prose> Also from that, light and
[9911] <prose> Emanate like weapon point.
[9912] <prose> That is Dharma space's wisdom introduction. || 200 ||
[9913] <prose> What is mirror-like wisdom's introduction?
[9914] <prose> Draw dust-color mandala between two silver mirrors,
[9915] <prose> Place mirror each on two near sides comparing interval,
[9916] <tantra> From that, two appearances arise.
[9917] <prose> Introduction of equality wisdom:
[9918] <prose> Seize essence on water moon.
[9919] <prose> Introduction of discriminating wisdom:
[9920] <prose> Seize essence on lamp.

[9925] <prose> Introduction of completely complete wisdom:
[9926] <prose> Seize essence by cloudless sky.
[9927] <prose> Those seven are wisdom's introduction.
[9928] <prose> Now demonstrating awareness's introduction:
[9929] <prose> Introduction of awareness youth vase body:
[9930] <prose> Place one wearing white clothes before self,
[9931] <prose> Place jewel on eye's top,
[9932] <prose> Extend eye to sky and look. || 220 ||
[9933] <prose> Will see Thus-come's peaceful body.
[9934] <prose> That is introduction of awareness vase body.
[9935] <prose> Introduction of awareness youth hero power-possessing body:

[9947] <prose> Introduction of awareness not abiding in anything:
[9948] <prose> Should know by looking eye to space-between.
[9949] <prose> Thus seven are awareness's introduction.
[9950] <prose> Having completed twenty-one thus,
[9951] <prose> At the time when that Buddha-family son passes from nirvāṇa,
[9952] <prose> Awareness arises from eye path, enters intermediate appearance. Thus it is spoken. || 240 ||
[9953] <prose> Second, two aspects of distinctive indicative manner:

[9955] <prose> And extensively separating that nature.
[9956] <ornament> First:

[10133] <prose> At wisdom, three—essence, nature, compassion.
[10134] <prose> At body: self-single, father-mother.
[10135] <prose> Three collections.
[10136] <prose> At bindu: three—base, path, fruit.
[10137] <prose> At awareness: three—base-abiding, characteristic-holding, field-appearance.
[10138] <prose> At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.
[10139] <prose> To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.
[10140] <prose> To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance.
[10141] <tantra> From that same source:
[10142] <prose> For purpose of all great ones, || 430 ||
[10143] <prose> By twenty-one introductions,
[10144] <prose> Gather that from outer to inner.
[10145] <break> <prose> Also gathered: these all.
[10146] <break> <prose> At light, two; at wisdom, three.
[10147] <prose> At body, three demonstrated; at bindu, three.
[10148] <prose> Awareness, three; at space, two.
[10149] <prose> For meaning of gathering those all.
[10150] <break> <prose> Very gathered: these all.
[10151] <break> <prose> By three: example, sign, meaning,
[10152] <prose> Obtain fruit of abiding self-nature. || 440 ||
[10153] <break> <prose> Enter god's yogin mudra,
[10154] <break> <prose> For meaning of sign-possessing.
[10155] <prose> Intention of single elaboration-free:
[10156] <prose> Free holding of all those.
[10157] <prose> Make ripening having ripened as path.
[10158] <prose> To abiding by manifest continuum,
[10159] <prose> By self seeing self heart-essence,
[10160] <prose> What do by all other efforts?
[10161] <prose> Should familiarize with this itself.
[10162] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 450 ||
[10163] <prose> Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:
[10164] <tantra> From Jewel Intricate Display:
[10165] <prose> Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvāṇa,
[10166] <prose> At the time of five hundred degenerations,
[10167] <prose> By those possessing deceiving child's nature,
[10168] <prose> The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.
[10169] <prose> At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.
[10170] <prose> True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example.
[10171] <prose> To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,
[10172] <prose> Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha. || 460 ||
[10173] <prose> Question: Is example introduction not blocked?
[10174] <prose> That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;
[10175] <prose> Some say different elements;
[10176] <prose> Some say light;
[10177] <prose> Demonstrate by god's body.
[10178] <prose> Common vehicle general,
[10179] <prose> Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,
[10180] <prose> To negate base of primordially pure awareness,
[10181] <prose> Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.
[10182] <prose> At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence, || 470 ||
[10183] <prose> However much demonstrating example, no deviation,
[10184] <prose> No grasping place.
[10185] <prose> Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,
[10186] <prose> Again essence,
[10187] <prose> Expansion,
[10188] <prose> By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,
[10189] <prose> With suitability.
[10190] <prose> That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus.
[10191] <tantra> From that same source:
[10192] <prose> Indicative example of Vajra-Mind: || 480 ||
[10193] <break> <prose> White color, moon's color,
[10194] <break> <prose> Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,
[10195] <prose> Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.
[10196] <prose> Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:
[10197] <prose> With experience-taking hand-guidance,
[10198] <prose> Without deviation place, without stagnate place,
[10199] <prose> Ear lineage and hand gesture together,
[10200] <prose> Confidence,
[10201] <prose> Cutting superimposition,
[10202] <prose> Connecting word and meaning. || 490 ||
[10203] <prose> Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.
[10204] <prose> ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[10205] <prose> Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,
[10206] <prose> Thus concludes the twenty-first chapter.
[10207] <prose> Thus having extensively demonstrated sequence of taking experience,
[10208] <prose> Now, demonstrating sequence of determining signs of yogin experience-taker has three aspects:
[10209] <prose> Generally demonstrating meaning of how purifying signs in former life now abide in body, speech, mind;
[10210] <prose> Explaining distinction of arising manner to three-door appearance possessing signs of now entering path.
