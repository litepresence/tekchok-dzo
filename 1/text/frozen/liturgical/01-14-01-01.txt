[17361] <prose> Mind is the abode,
[17362] <prose> And Dharmakāya is the abode of primordial wisdom.
[17363] <prose> From the Kunzang Klongdru Tantra:
[17364] <tantra> "Hey, great mind-hero!
[17365] <tantra> The abode of mind
[17366] <tantra> Is the Kunzhi.
[17367] <tantra> Why is this?
[17368] <tantra> Because the Kunzhi gathers all objects of thought</tantra>
[17369] <tantra> And is known as mind."
[17370] <prose> The abode of primordial wisdom is the Dharmakāya. || 10 ||
[17371] <prose> Why is this?
[17372] <prose> Because the Dharmakāya does not possess any memory or thought,
[17373] <prose> And has no knowledge that grasps objects as different.
[17374] <prose> Thus it is.
[17375] <prose> Here, some with manifest arrogance
[17376] <prose> Think that Kunzhi is Dharmakāya.
[17377] <prose> This is also from common treatises:
[17378] <prose> Kunzhi is considered the support of all pure and impure,
[17379] <prose> And Dharmakāya is considered the stainless suchness within the pure.
[17380] <prose> Also from some mantras: || 20 ||
[17381] <prose> Kunzhi transformed in abode is considered the wisdom of the dharmadhatu and the svabhavikakaya,
[17382] <prose> For Kunzhi is the ground of all.
[17383] <prose> "It is also the mother-ground of nirvāṇa,"
[17384] <prose> It is said.
[17385] <prose> Kunzhi transformed in abode
[17386] <prose> Is said to be the wisdom of the dharmadhatu, the svabhavikakaya, and though explained as different, they are said to be contradictory in substance even within.
[17387] <prose> There is harm in this.
[17388] <prose> If Kunzhi were Dharmakāya, it would follow that Dharmakāya possesses stains,
[17389] <prose> And that Kunzhi producing the delusion of container and contained would mean Dharmakāya produces delusion.
[17390] <prose> If one thinks thus, || 30 ||
[17391] <prose> It would follow that Buddhas again become deluded as sentient beings, and so on, harmed by reasoning,
[17392] <prose> And also not harmed by unsurpassable scripture.
[17393] <prose> From the Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind:
[17394] <tantra> "Those who think Kunzhi is Dharmakāya deviate from me."
[17395] <prose> Thus it is said.
[17396] <prose> From Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[17397] <prose> Some think Kunzhi is Dharmakāya.
[17398] <prose> To teach the reply to them:
[17399] <prose> The characteristics of Kunzhi are as follows.
[17400] <prose> Then he spoke the reply: || 40 ||
[17401] <tantra> "Because all is complete, it is Kunzhi.
[17402] <break> <tantra> Then the asking words are reversed.
[17403] <break> <tantra> It is reasonable that Buddhas become.
[17404] <tantra> Because Kunzhi appears as various,
[17405] <tantra> Because from that all is complete,
[17406] <tantra> Sentient beings are reasonable as Buddhas.
[17407] <tantra> Why? Because all is complete.
[17408] <tantra> Or else they become occasional.
[17409] <tantra> Why? Because they appear as various.
[17410] <tantra> Occasionally they become Buddhas, || 50 ||
[17411] <tantra> Occasionally they become sentient beings.
[17412] <tantra> Why? Because of definite establishment.
[17413] <tantra> Then the asking is reversed and spoken:
[17414] <tantra> Then does Kunzhi not exist?
[17415] <tantra> Then the reply to the asking is given:
[17416] <tantra> To Kunzhi grasping thought,
[17417] <tantra> The awareness of various delusions is deceived.
[17418] <tantra> The actual non-awareness of all is.
[17419] <tantra> Thus it is."
[17420] <prose> Therefore distinguishing Kunzhi and Dharmakāya is precious. || 60 ||
[17421] <prose> From the Six Expanses:
[17422] <prose> Therefore if Kunzhi and Dharmakāya are not distinguished, it is like the awareness that grasps one form as different,
[17423] <prose> The meaning cannot appear individually.
[17424] <prose> The examples for these two
[17425] <prose> Are like the ocean and a boat.
[17426] <prose> Dharmakāya, the awareness of primordial purity without defilements ever experienced, is like the clear ocean expanse,
[17427] <prose> Not established anywhere, with unobstructed potential to appear anywhere.
[17428] <prose> The first field, completely pure by nature,
[17429] <prose> Free of adventitious defilements, having gained stability in that expanse, is the aspect possessing the two purities.
[17430] <prose> Kunzhi is like not entering a boat on top of the ocean. || 70 ||
[17431] <prose> At the time of delusion from the first expanse, the ground non-awareness of the ground is the support of all,
[17432] <prose> The pervader,
[17433] <prose> The essence abiding, like a boat,
[17434] <prose> Filled with many persons of mind, mental factors, karma, habits, and delusions.
[17435] <prose> From Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[17436] <prose> The example of Kunzhi and Dharmakāya
[17437] <prose> Is the manner of ocean and boat, the arising of the path.
[17438] <prose> The manner of falling asleep and waking,
[17439] <prose> Thus because faculties possess distinctions.
[17440] <prose> That also, awareness without defilement, the essence of Dharmakāya at all times, is not something to be reversed and exists as the ground of final liberation, || 80 ||
[17441] <prose> While Kunzhi, like sleep, becomes the ground from which all dream-like deluded appearances arise, and the distinction of needing to awaken is very great.
[17442] <prose> That also, though sleep and dreams need to be reversed,
[17443] <prose> One's own awareness does not need to be reversed.
[17444] <prose> Dharmakāya is to be examined as the ground,
[17445] <prose> And through familiarization with its state,
[17446] <prose> The result is identified as the place of liberation.
[17447] <prose> One should know that Kunzhi and the dharmas depending on it are to be purified as stains.
[17448] <prose> Second, the extensive explanation has two parts:
[17449] <list> Kunzhi and
[17450] <list> Extensive explanation of Dharmakāya. || 90 ||
[17451] <prose> First:
[17452] <prose> From the Thalgyur:
[17453] <verse> "The essential point of Kunzhi and Dharmakāya,
[17454] <verse> First Kunzhi is explained there:
[17455] <verse> The ground of all dharma and non-dharma,
[17456] <verse> With divisions of essence, words, and meanings,
[17457] <verse> The container of all habitual tendencies,
[17458] <verse> Divisions of body, connection,
[17459] <verse> Various and primordial ground.
[17460] <verse> Definitive meaning is gathered in all, || 100 ||
[17461] <verse> ground is complete, and so on."
[17462] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[17463] <prose> The nature of Kunzhi,
[17464] <break> <ornament> Definitive meaning,
[17465] <break> <ornament> Divisions,
[17466] <prose> Cause of sound entry, and from five:
[17467] <prose> First, the nature:
[17468] <prose> It becomes the container of compounded virtuous forms and all samsaric dharmas complete with habitual tendencies.
[17469] <prose> The definitive meaning:
[17470] <prose> Among all-many, || 110 ||
[17471] <prose> The ground gathered, abiding as the ground or support-ground at the time of many.
[17472] <prose> If divided:
[17473] <list> Kunzhi of original meaning,
[17474] <list> Kunzhi of connection meaning,
[17475] <list> Kunzhi of body habitual tendencies,
[17476] <list> And Kunzhi of various habitual tendencies—four.
[17477] <prose> First:
[17478] <prose> The first ground, the dimension of all samsaric dharmas,
[17479] <prose> Spoken from the reverse of the first movement of the investigator, the co-existent ignorance dependent on awareness.
[17480] <prose> Second: || 120 ||
[17481] <prose> From that consciousness itself, if self-ignorance, it connects to saṃsāra,
[17482] <prose> If realized, it connects to nirvāṇa—spoken from that aspect.
[17483] <prose> Third:
[17484] <prose> On that root consciousness itself,
[17485] <prose> Because body habitual tendencies exist,
[17486] <list> Flesh,
[17487] <break> <list> Blood,
[17488] <break> <list> Light,
[17489] <prose> Spoken from the aspect of mind-body appearing.
[17490] <prose> Fourth: || 130 ||
[17491] <prose> Spoken from the aspect of that consciousness itself making the ground of the source of impure karma and habitual tendencies.
[17492] <prose> Thus though spoken as four names,
[17493] <prose> It is labeled on the aspect of one consciousness having four distinctions.
[17494] <prose> Thus from the time of the first movement grasped until now, the support of all consciousnesses is Kunzhi, and depending on it, the eight consciousnesses abiding also, if divided individually, the root saṃsāra door-opening appearing ground of original meaning, and the connection meaning by connecting saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and by body appearing, and by mind habitual tendencies supporting, Kunzhi is placed as basis, and at that time, because consciousness form exists without ceasing outer-inner, it is labeled as Kunzhi consciousness.
[17495] <prose> From that, the five sense consciousnesses, from the aspect of grasping the five objects with self-consciousness without thought, are labeled as the five door consciousnesses.
[17496] <prose> At that time, by realization of the inward-looking investigation mouth, by meeting first there, by mind-knowledge investigating, grasping distinctions individually as the meaning itself is thought.
[17497] <prose> One should know mind as one with different reversals.
[17498] <prose> The function:
[17499] <list> It makes the ground of original delusion,
[17500] <list> By connecting, it connects body-mind and makes the connection of bliss and suffering, || 140 ||
[17501] <list> By body, it makes the many conditions of body and its gatherings,
[17502] <list> It makes the accumulation of karma and afflictions of habitual tendencies, and makes causes and conditions.
[17503] <prose> The cause of sound entry:
[17504] <prose> By making the connecting-before-and-after of habitual tendencies,
[17505] <prose> And the outer connection of five karmic results,
[17506] <prose> And the fitting-together of cause and effect,
[17507] <prose> By making the binding of universal connection,
[17508] <prose> The sound of Kunzhi enters.
[17509] <prose> Second, extensive explanation of Dharmakāya:
[17510] <prose> From the Thalgyur: || 150 ||
[17511] <verse> "Dharmakāya is free from elaboration,
[17512] <verse> No signs of grasping self-as,
[17513] <verse> Nature empty-luminous without difference,
[17514] <verse> Divisions of Dharma, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya,
[17515] <break> <verse> Distinguished by three, distinction enters.
[17516] <break> <verse> Definitive meaning: Dharma is the correct path,
[17517] <verse> Body is accomplished from that.
[17518] <verse> Thus it is taught."
[17519] <prose> The nature of Dharmakāya,
[17520] <break> <ornament> Definitive meaning, || 160 ||
[17521] <break> <ornament> Divisions,
[17522] <ornament> Function,
[17523] <prose> Cause of sound entry, and from five:
