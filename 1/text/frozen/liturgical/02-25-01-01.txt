[15635] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[15636] <prose> The very ground of liberation is primordially pure—thus the Victorious Ones declare. || 1 ||
[15637] <prose> Through knowing rigpa's self-nature as primordially pure, one does not return to the cause of samsara. When the ground of delusion is exhausted, the result is merely a change of name.
[15638] <prose> As explained previously in the section on the ground, understand this specifically. Through separation from impurity and the recognition of innate purity.
[15639] <prose> The second topic has three aspects: the actual sphere of liberation — the nature of abiding within the sphere — and how the sphere of dharmatā's meaning rolls into the expanse of primordial purity. || 5 ||
[15640] <prose> First, whether faculties are sharp, dull, or middling, when the three are liberated, there is no difference in the result.
[15641] <prose> All Buddhas of the three times, their meaning exhausted in the Dharmakāya, are expressionless and one. Equal, without difference in nature, they are a single bindu, a single Buddha.
[15642] <prose> Whether in this life with signs, or in the bardo through self-appearance, or in the emanation realm when breath is released, the body of path-appearance and the appearance of wisdom follow the sequence. They follow the dissolution of spontaneous presence.
[15643] <prose> The sphere sinks as crystal light gathers inward — wisdom sinks into the sphere — and the form body dissolves into the Dharmakāya's expanse beyond sorrow.
[15644] <prose> Phenomena without signs, dharmatā space-like, of one taste—like space sinking into space. || 10 ||
[15645] <prose> As an example, when rigpa is cut separate from the sphere yet abides in the body, it is like space inside a vase.
[15646] <prose> When the opening connects, the four lamps join with primordial purity. When the vase breaks, the outer, inner, and middle—the three spaces without difference—abide as one essence.
[15647] <prose> When body and mind separate, the five rigpas, without outer greatness, abide as the inner sphere of great primordial purity.
[15648] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15649] <verse> Samantabhadra's nature, all elaboration ceased, is the peerless Buddha.
[15650] <verse> All phenomena without eye-dust—when endless realms appear without outer or inner distinction, the completely pure expanse's meaning is obtained.
[15651] <verse> Then cyclic existence itself is called ended from the primordial. || 20 ||
[15652] <prose> Thus space mixes, or outer appearance's self-light rays sink into the sphere, like the sun setting as rays gather into themselves.
[15653] <prose> Water sinking into water, butter into butter—similar to relic burning from the essence of primordial purity.
[15654] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15655] <verse> Like rays gathered from the sun, self-appearance and emanation included,
[15656] <verse> One's own nature sinking into itself, becoming without difference, without division.
[15657] <verse> Just as water sinks into water, and likewise butter sinks into butter,
[15658] <verse> And space sinks into space—becoming without duality, without certain grasping. || 30 ||
[15659] <prose> Then, sinking into the inner sphere of primordial purity, rigpa abides in its own place.
[15660] <prose> The Conqueror becomes the Unchanging Light Buddha, the Teacher of Complete Dominion—Samantabhadra, the Lord of Spontaneous Presence Wisdom, the Vajra Holder.
[15661] <prose> Path phenomena are obtained as the result and exhausted, and result phenomena, like the full moon's increase and exhaustion, are completely perfected.
[15662] <prose> Beyond going, the exhaustion ground is reached.
[15663] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15664] <verse> Realized persons—intelligent, capable—sink into the unchanging, equal nature. || 40 ||
[15665] <verse> Thought-free wisdom self-arises in Sukhavati's great ground.
[15666] <verse> Uncontrived, like a heap of jewels—various arisings sink into the nature.
[15667] <verse> The ancestor of all Buddhas, the Unchanging Light, is renowned throughout.
[15668] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15669] <verse> Recollections and knowings at the time of nirvana—expressions' ends all self-exhausted.
[15670] <verse> Aggregates, elements, and sense-bases beyond sorrow—all appearance manifests as the bliss realm.
[15671] <verse> Faculties and objects beyond sorrow—the great enjoyment mudra self-appears.
[15672] <verse> Sounds and words beyond sorrow—all appearance gone beyond. || 50 ||
[15673] <verse> View, meditation, conduct, and result beyond sorrow—effort included, recollections self-exhausted.
[15674] <verse> Experience beyond sorrow at exhaustion time—feelings' doors self-ceased.
[15675] <verse> Warmth and signs self-exhausted, afflictions self-exhausted and emptied.
[15676] <verse> Exhaustion phenomena—conduct persons produced, self-perfected.
[15677] <prose> The essence abiding in this—fortunate persons who see—all Buddhas' result, Samantabhadra's nature, self-abides.
[15678] <prose> Whoever becomes accustomed to the Buddhas' result becomes the glorious Vajra Holder, the primordial lord, stainless and pure.
[15679] <prose> Light interior self-arisen and clear, the self-nature of all Buddhas' activity obtains the great secret body.
[15680] <tantra> From that not returning: the yogi, intelligent, capable, powerful, and fortunate, who reaches the measure of all results is equal to Samantabhadra. || 60 ||
[15681] <prose> Such primordial purity in its own place, beyond the end of existence and non-existence, transcends body, wisdom, appearance, existence, and non-existence.
[15682] <prose> The arising ground unceasing is merely the crystal top in its own place—light and color nowhere established.
[15683] <prose> That nature, the unceased arising ground of the five lights, serves as the example.
[15684] <tantra> From the Thal Gyur:
[15685] <verse> Although the result cannot be expressed, phenomena reach the exhaustion ground.
[15686] <verse> One's own established view also ceases—this time, the guru's instruction sinks. || 70 ||
[15687] <verse> View, meditation, and conduct's end emptied—phenomena appearance neither exist nor not exist.
[15688] <verse> Body and wisdom stream ceased—without Buddha, without beings.
[15689] <verse> Briefly, anything abiding without, gone without, coming without.
[15690] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15691] <verse> Thus Dharmatā primordial purity—without wisdom, also without body.
[15692] <verse> Without light, without color—whose essence is without establishment.
[15693] <verse> Non-recognition and affliction—what use, existence, non-existence? || 80 ||
[15694] <prose> Thus the inner sphere of primordial purity, whose nature is merely the arising ground, is actually without establishment anywhere.
[15695] <tantra> From that source:
[15696] <verse> Natural appearance—sign apprehension primordially without.
[15697] <verse> Color non-own, self-clear—knowing and knowing, only parts.
[15698] <verse> Apprehension without object, conception without apprehension part.
[15699] <verse> Beyond light, self-radiance—primordially distinction abiding.
[15700] <verse> Beyond body, self-radiance—the completely pure great mudra abiding. || 90 ||
[15701] <prose> Second, the nature of rigpa abiding in the sphere has five aspects: elements latent in the mother, wisdom sinking into the sphere, wisdom supported in space, clear light rolling into the sphere, and rigpa holding its own place.
[15702] <prose> First, when the three interiors are rolled into one, the five elements are liberated in the mother—the pure wisdom eye without obstruction.
[15703] <prose> When impure deluded appearance sinks into pure dharmatā, the flesh and blood body sinks into the clear light illusion body.
[15704] <prose> That itself sinking into the Dharmakāya, the precious secret body—the wisdom eye sinks into the wisdom eye, that itself sinking into the Dharmatā eye.
[15705] <prose> Object, knowing, and conduct parts purified, the precious secret interior's wisdom inner clear meaning is without change. || 100 ||
[15706] <tantra> From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror:
[15707] <verse> Impure deluded appearance obscures wisdom appearance.
[15708] <verse> When deluded appearance ceases, pure appearance dawns clear.
[15709] <verse> Habitual patterns in the interior obscure wisdom illusion body.
[15710] <verse> When this body is abandoned, light appearance dawns clear.
[15711] <verse> Then the precious interior reaches the end. || 110 ||
[15712] <prose> When the three interiors are rolled into one, emanation is enacted in the ten directions.
[15713] <prose> Now the impure parts of the body's five elements are purified into the clear light inner sphere of primordial purity, the sphere of the great five elements.
[15714] <prose> The impure five elements transform into the pure force of the five wisdom pure great elements, relying on appearance.
[15715] <prose> Wind arranged well in the vajra cross, the samaya goddess rolling into space, unmoving wind sinks into the sphere.
[15716] <prose> Earth, the five precious stupas evenly in essence, sinks into the earth sphere without hardness.
[15717] <prose> Water, crystal wheel arranged well, liberated from action and affliction, sinks into the water sphere without moistness. || 120 ||
[15718] <prose> Fire, lotus net blazing light, ripening the unripened, sinks into the fire sphere without heat.
[15719] <prose> Space, completely pure dharmatā expanse vast, primordially pure, opening delusion impure, sinks into the space sphere.
[15720] <prose> Outer objects, inner body, aggregates, elements, sense-bases—all phenomena parts purified into the wisdom precious essence mandala of emptiness all-arising.
[15721] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15722] <verse> Precious five colors' ground all even,
[15723] <verse> Precious secret sun without arising or setting,
[15724] <verse> Precious water lotus without stain,
[15725] <verse> Precious fire mandala arranged well,
[15726] <verse> Precious wind wisdom without conception. || 130 ||
[15727] <verse> Precious earth mandala great vehicle,
[15728] <verse> Precious space without end or center,
[15729] <verse> Precious empty mandala drawn well,
[15730] <verse> Precious relic burning stupa arranged well—introduction adorned.
[15731] <prose> Eye and eye consciousness, ear and ear consciousness, nose and smell consciousness, tongue and tongue consciousness, body and body consciousness—knowing suchness.
[15732] <prose> Body completely beyond sorrow, form aggregate purified. Space completely beyond sorrow, consciousness aggregate purified.
[15733] <prose> Earth completely beyond sorrow, feeling aggregate purified. Fire completely beyond sorrow, aggregate purified. || 140 ||
[15734] <prose> Wind completely beyond sorrow, aggregate purified—thus it is.
[15735] <prose> Second, wisdom sinking into the sphere: the five afflictions purified as the five wisdoms, the five self-radiances sinking into the inner sphere clear light.
[15736] <prose> Deep radiance abiding as the ground of the five colors.
[15737] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15738] <verse> White part of moved self-radiance, deep clear great abiding.
[15739] <verse> Yellow part of self-exhausted appearance, unmanifest deep self-nature clear.
[15740] <verse> Red part of self-exhausted attachment-aversion, deep radiance unmixed great abiding. || 150 ||
[15741] <verse> Green of effort moved self-separated, exhaustion without, primordial rays also.
[15742] <verse> Blue of unchanging perfected, unmanifest deep clear part, primordially perfected without abiding.
[15743] <prose> Third, wisdom supported in space: the five wisdom winds of the inner sphere abiding unmoving in their own place without change.
[15744] <prose> The powerful, force-holding, lifting, stable, appearance-making five—water pure nature down clearing powerful.
[15745] <prose> Wisdom wind chief without retinue joined, meaning differenceless.
[15746] <prose> Wind pure nature up going force-holding, chief and retinue five instantly moved into Dharmakāya. || 160 ||
[15747] <prose> Earth pure nature pervading arising ground abiding, lifting support and supported without, Dharmakāya form body abiding.
[15748] <prose> Appearance-making space pure nature without equal, arising four Dharmakāya wisdom actually without, deep clear arising ground inner clear abiding.
[15749] <prose> Stable earth pure nature life wind arising ground, Rigpa wisdom non-conceptual meaning unmoving made.
[15750] <tantra> From that source:
[15751] <verse> Primordially self-pure great, perfected peak abiding.
[15752] <verse> With signs self-purified, deep clear great ground abiding. || 170 ||
[15753] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15754] <verse> Precious arrangement net even called.
[15755] <prose> Fourth, clear light sphere rolled four: sunk non-dulled, clear without conception, existing without self, individual unmixed without division.
[15756] <prose> First, sunk non-dulled: elements latent in mother, wisdom sphere sunk, three bodies gathering and separation without, subtle wisdom inner clear abiding.
[15757] <prose> Second, Dharmakāya stainless without front or back, up or down, directions or corners, clear light.
[15758] <prose> Body and wisdom arising ground abiding, mind and breath without, samsara phenomena unstained.
[15759] <prose> Third, existing view self-arisen king without habitual patterns' self. || 180 ||
[15760] <prose> Fourth, Dharmakāya expanse precious light blazing, five bodies deep clear abiding.
[15761] <prose> Primordial ground own place abiding, without conception of ground, without division of samsara delusion now.
[15762] <prose> Wisdom body ripened, five bodies moved into sphere arising.
[15763] <prose> Fifth, rigpa holding its own place four: Dharmakāya without change vajra-like body, wisdom without change eternity-like life, meaning without gathering or separation river-like continuum, rigpa without clear or dull sun-like rays.
[15764] <prose> First, rigpa form body Dharmakāya sunk, essence became one, without change.
[15765] <prose> Second, essence-apprehending wisdom, nature characteristics-apprehending wisdom, compassion beings-taming wisdom arising ground part own place differenceless permanent abiding all-time wisdom. || 190 ||
[15766] <prose> Third, continuum meditation without gathering or separation, Dharmatā inconceivable meditation without change.
[15767] <prose> Fourth, individual self-arisen rigpa inner clear spontaneous presence great abiding, precious interior without change abiding.
[15768] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15769] <verse> Precious vajra seat without change,
[15770] <verse> Precious empty path without end—meaning self-abiding instruction shown called.
[15771] <prose> Third, how the sphere of dharmatā meaning rolls into the expanse: essence briefly shown, parts extensively explained, meaning conclusion gathered. || 200 ||
[15772] <prose> First, the essence of clear light wisdom rigpa in the sphere of primordial purity spontaneous presence deep clear is the root of all Buddha phenomena, called the great scripture.
[15773] <prose> Endless and vast, the Buddha powerful, the view's end carrying place, unchanging vajra—beyond this side's seen mind examined object, the all-knowing mirror, path's peak traveled, liberation object secret king, phenomena treasury great, without letter.
[15774] <tantra> From that source:
[15775] <verse> Furthermore, rigpa wisdom not mistaken shown, unchanging root great scripture,
[15776] <verse> Vast Dharma appearance great, meaning Dharmatā powerful great view self-arisen liberation place,
[15777] <verse> Great unchanging vajra letter, permanent difficult expanse, difficult view mirror, difficult path, difficult abiding object, difficult gone ground,
[15778] <verse> Great without existence appearance, end without difficult, pervading without self-radiance great, knowing great without examination object. || 210 ||
[15779] <verse> Knowing without meaning great mind without appearance great, unchanging completely spread great, subtle difficult grasp great, great seeing without great, round form without great, shaking breath without great, clear color black great without, softness great appearance difficult examine great, empty appearance great, one extent not cut great, two appearance completely perfected great, beautiful ornament without great, full empty great, ripened unperfected great, body appearance coming going without great called.
[15780] <prose> Thus the sphere and wisdom appearing as two are Dharmakāya nature deep clear body arising ground appearance.
[15781] <prose> Second, extensively explained parts: essence emptiness as primordial purity space-like, anywhere unestablished, extreme separated Great Perfection Dharmakāya expanse vast.
[15782] <prose> Therefore parts clear measure, Dharmakāya expanse depth inner clear spontaneous presence wisdom body speech mind inexhaustible ornament wheel source subtle part deep clear abiding.
[15783] <prose> That side separated, five wisdoms mandala primordially clear—wisdom above without other high, wisdom palace spontaneously accomplished wide. || 220 ||
[15784] <tantra> From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror:
[15785] <verse> Precious arrangement mandala not drawn clear,
[15786] <verse> Wisdom stable mountain king not built high,
[15787] <verse> Wisdom spread palace not made wide,
[15788] <verse> Wisdom expanse ocean not disturbed self-radiance,
[15789] <verse> Wisdom clear sun not made without arising or setting.
[15790] <verse> Emptiness spread ground not arranged even,
[15791] <verse> Wisdom unchanging path not trained without near or far. || 230 ||
[15792] <verse> Rigpa unchanging horse running without cut,
[15793] <verse> Rigpa aimless water stream without cease,
[15794] <verse> Rigpa wisdom seed without increase or decrease,
[15795] <verse> Rigpa empty clear wisdom without difference,
[15796] <verse> Rigpa non-apprehending wisdom without extreme.
[15797] <verse> Rigpa non-conceptual wisdom unceased completely clear,
[15798] <verse> Rigpa all-clear wisdom unmixed completely perfected,
[15799] <verse> Rigpa all-appearance wisdom clear without apprehension,
[15800] <verse> Rigpa all-clear wisdom clear spontaneous called. || 240 ||
[15801] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15802] <verse> Precious arranged palace arranged well,
[15803] <verse> Precious adorned queen ornament beautiful,
[15804] <verse> Precious beautiful horse fast quick,
[15805] <verse> Precious various ground exhaustion without called.
[15806] <prose> Third, meaning conclusion: sphere and wisdom without difference, Buddha qualities accumulation without measure.
[15807] <tantra> From the Precious Light Arrangement:
[15808] <verse> Perfectly perfected Buddha miracle without measure,
[15809] <verse> Immeasurable, ungraspable, immeasurable, incomparable. || 250 ||
[15810] <verse> Buddha appearance beyond great small end, space-like.
[15811] <verse> Buddha power beyond is-is-not end, elephant-like.
[15812] <verse> Buddha capacity beyond abandonment-obtainment end, lion-like.
[15813] <verse> Buddha qualities beyond empty end, wish-fulfilling jewel precious like.
[15814] <verse> Buddha essence beyond self-thought end, all-pervading wisdom itself.
[15815] <verse> Buddha abiding beyond faculties-objects, self-appearance itself.
[15816] <verse> Self-arisen meaning itself speech called.
[15817] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen Rigpa:
[15818] <verse> Perfectly perfected Buddha meaning without end. || 260 ||
[15819] <verse> Buddha realization without measure, wisdom without calculation, abiding without good bad, view without is-is-not, ground without extent cut, path without change, result without returning to cause, wisdom without clear dull, wisdom without mind called.
[15820] <prose> Thus Buddha actual ground result end reached completed, self-traveled path without.
[15821] <prose> Buddhas Bhagavans path cut entry cut elaboration samsara leading cut object explained.
[15822] <prose> Disciples leading compassion path body wisdom activity outer appearance enacted reliance explained—non-learning path explained.
[15823] <prose> Third, certainty of body and wisdom arising ground: arising ground recognition and nature extensively explained. || 270 ||
[15824] <prose> First, wrong conception refutation: abandonment realization end Dharmakāya primordial purity spontaneous presence precious interior body wisdom arising ground.
[15825] <prose> Thus essence empty clear self-arisen wisdom anywhere unestablished, anywhere not divided, not dividing, without division, beyond expression thought, liberated from samsara end, space-like anywhere unestablished, qualities without measure like sun moon planets stars all-arising arising ground, wisdom perfected body called.
[15826] <tantra> From the Thal Gyur:
[15827] <verse> Buddhas' Dharmatā not divided not dividing equal—sounds words names how could exist?
[15828] <verse> Relied ground self-pure delusion pure, samsara liberation name not known.
[15829] <verse> Not arisen not born cessation without, all-arising wisdom which non. || 280 ||
[15830] <verse> Self-place exhausted Dharmatā, elements exhausted with signs ceased, atoms smallest end ceased, parts even abiding non.
[15831] <verse> Afflictions exhausted delusion, thought-free attachment abiding non, habitual patterns all rising, dust part even abiding non—thus coarse subtle exhausted.
[15832] <verse> Aggregates five also end gradually subtle, elements four body exhausted, all wisdom perfected body, thought-free meditation self-abiding, contrived phenomena beyond, phenomena word abiding non.
[15833] <prose> Second, three: desire assertion, those refutation, correct tradition establishment. || 290 ||
[15834] <prose> First, early some say when perfectly Buddha time primordial purity unestablished, body wisdom phenomena without, arising ground also non.
[15835] <prose> Some say body wisdom actual abiding without, result Dharmakāya wisdom obtained without, — therefore obtained decline therefore—thus asserted.
[15836] <prose> Those refutation two: reasoning and scripture.
[15837] <prose> First position: Buddha without wisdom, self-meaning other-meaning not arising therefore, like space empty without difference.
[15838] <prose> Second position: phenomena speakers Dharmakāya phenomena signs established thing coarse existence therefore, form self-characteristics established, characteristics wisdom actual established, conception without difference therefore.
[15839] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15840] <verse> Without known wisdom difference, thing characteristics difference what existence? || 300 ||
[15841] <verse> Or empty partial this change only.
[15842] <tantra> From the Illuminating Lamp:
[15843] <verse> Thus wisdom without part, outer space empty, difference itself existence.
[15844] <verse> Therefore ground wisdom pervading, without wisdom nihilist, difference what existence non.
[15845] <verse> Coarse wisdom existence becomes, or examination itself equal.
[15846] <prose> Third, correct tradition: primordial purity own place anywhere unestablished, beyond existence non-existence end, body wisdom established like crystal top.
[15847] <prose> That nature sphere part arising ground part very subtle wisdom three abiding, crystal inner light actually seeing object without, like arising ground abiding. || 310 ||
[15848] <prose> Moreover, three wisdoms existence body wisdom all source became, Dharmakāya unmoving form body activity disciples appearance capable capacity ground arising.
[15849] <prose> Thus non-Buddha Dharmakāya taste one, without wisdom beings meaning Buddha phenomena without measure completely without becomes therefore.
[15850] <tantra> From the Collection:
[15851] <verse> Without wisdom qualities increase without enlightenment, ocean-like Buddha phenomena without becomes.
[15852] <prose> Thus wisdom without expression anywhere unestablished refutation, wisdom existence expression nature spontaneous presence part expression, contradiction without primordial purity spontaneous presence two without.
[15853] <prose> Second, nature extensively explained: sphere primordial purity Dharmakāya nature, wisdom spontaneous presence subtle nature abiding, ground apprehending wisdom actual subtle abiding.
[15854] <prose> That part characteristics apprehending wisdom five, known knowing wisdom arising ground part actual clear only existence. || 320 ||
[15855] <tantra> From the Thal Gyur:
[15856] <verse> Thus also mind ripened time, Dharmakāya ground abiding, primordially pure stain exhausted, essence primordially delusion without, arising unceased spontaneous presence.
[15857] <prose> Thus primordial purity sphere spontaneous presence abiding, essence nature compassion part subtle actual appearance.
[15858] <prose> Ground abiding wisdom three other two arising ground made.
[15859] <tantra> From that source:
[15860] <verse> Thus liberation mind, without compassion non. || 330 ||
[15861] <verse> Ground abiding wisdom nature force arising ground made, characteristics apprehending wisdom conditions pure ripened made, known knowing wisdom devotion capable siddhi given.
[15862] <prose> Thus ground abiding three arising ground made manner.
[15863] <prose> Essence three bodies arising ground made, three bodies difference appearance part unestablished.
[15864] <prose> Nature five lights arising ground made, color self-characteristics unestablished, compassion wisdom two arising ground made, object parts actual measure without.
[15865] <tantra> From the Thal Gyur:
[15866] <verse> Thus essence body abiding, Dharmakāya enjoyment emanation part, not divided dividing without manner, descended established from, body color etc mind object without. || 340 ||
[15867] <verse> Nature arising light manner: white red yellow green blue, signs characteristics without, without class known descended established.
[15868] <verse> Compassion appearance various from, this one certainty without, various appearance ground called.
[15869] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15870] <verse> With signs signs self-purified, deep clear great ground abiding. || 350 ||
[15871] <verse> Pervading pervaded itself empty, partial from cut without appearance.
[15872] <verse> Clear appearance part unceased, essence all essence gathered, stain without self-pure.
[15873] <verse> Buddhas secret great nature part abiding, compassion appearance part various from, empty part cessation without itself.
[15874] <verse> Known wisdom two appearance part appearance, without appearance self-pure from, nature force compassion.
[15875] <verse> Activity effort without, without appearance manner pure. || 360 ||
[15876] <verse> Primordially dividing without appearance, sun light like, own made non, own nature thus appearance.
[15877] <verse> Known how itself knowing, compassion part wisdom own phenomena abiding manner knowing.
[15878] <verse> Wisdom that part without, elements form difference what existence, known how much knowing.
[15879] <verse> Compassion wisdom disciples intention knowing, without space like equal, — therefore all-knowing.
[15880] <verse> Wisdom compassion part appearance, all recollection held non, nature itself abiding from. || 370 ||
[15881] <verse> Apprehending apprehending coarse abiding non, deep clear subtle part appearance, this beings path, above seed like increase, this appearance unceased.
[15882] <verse> Own suitable medicine capacity like, six realms suitable appearance, — therefore compassion.
[15883] <prose> Thus arising ground part emanation clear, wisdom two actual disciples six realms meaning enacted, primordial purity time actual without seed manner abiding.
[15884] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[15885] <verse> Essence nature compassion appearance pure, essence anywhere unestablished, nature appearance part clear appearance. || 380 ||
[15886] <verse> Compassion part wisdom two enacted enactor without clear, clear appearance mind level two therefore, wisdom activity thus, effort accomplishment without appearance.
[15887] <verse> Buddhas' wisdom ground thus appearance called.
[15888] <prose> Thus sphere wisdom without Dharmakāya end primordial purity spontaneous presence without liberation ground primordial purity great called.
[15889] <prose> Nature arising ground abiding essence anywhere unestablished, ultimate truth single completely perfected great body wisdom beyond Dharmatā space-like.
[15890] <prose> End result inner sphere great liberation ground unsurpassed body speech mind without vajra secret spontaneous presence precious interior. || 390 ||
[15891] <tantra> From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror:
[15892] <verse> Thus-gone body arising abiding non—why? Thus-gone body actual without therefore.
[15893] <verse> Thus-gone speech turning non-turning non—why? Thus-gone speech empty therefore.
