[1754] <ornament> Now, regarding the explanation of the progressive manner of taking experience through the definite path:
[1755] <prose> Those with object-mind enter definitely through the supreme method that leads above, and
[1756] <prose> Those with the mind of rigpa's self-appearance take direct experience through the well-said pith instructions that are definite, traversing in this very life to the great liberation city through the secret supreme method.
[1757] <prose> The common approach: from the progressive entry of the definite mind, it is shown beginning with
[1758] <prose> The meaning of the first ground, in which there are three kinds of ties:
[1759] <prose> Who performs the experience-taking: the distinction of the yogin, and
[1760] <prose> How the experience-taking manner is made definite, and
[1761] <prose> The actual meaning of experience-taking is shown.
[1762] <prose> First, among these three:
[1763] <prose> The common distinction, || 10 ||
[1764] <prose> The explanation of individual meanings,
[1765] <prose> The definite supreme place.
[1766] <ornament> First:
[1767] <tantra> From the Rang-shar:
[1768] <tantra> Kye kye! Close assembly, listen!
[1769] <tantra> The characteristic word yogin, and
[1770] <tantra> The sign-mere-holding yogin, and
[1771] <tantra> The following yogin itself, and
[1772] <tantra> The nature-definite yogin, and
[1773] <tantra> The appearance-mind yogin, and || 20 ||
[1774] <tantra> The enter-action yogin, and
[1775] <tantra> The action-cause yogin, and
[1776] <tantra> The doer-condition yogin, and
[1777] <tantra> The end-arrive-fruit yogin, and
[1778] <tantra> The authentic-meaning yogin, and
[1779] <tantra> The end-arrive-liberation yogin, and
[1780] <tantra> The done-complete yogin.
[1781] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1782] <ornament> Second: regarding the explanation of individual meanings, from among the twelve yogins,
[1783] <prose> The first eight do not liberate, and || 30 ||
[1784] <prose> The manner of liberation of the later four is definitely shown.
[1785] <prose> Also from that itself:
[1786] <tantra> The characteristic word yogin:
[1787] <tantra> Attachs to words and engages with words,
[1788] <tantra> Relying upon not-knowing words.
[1789] <tantra> I do not speak that itself as liberated.
[1790] <tantra> The sign-relying yogin:
[1791] <tantra> From relying upon signs of self itself,
[1792] <tantra> Doing conduct that flatters others,
[1793] <tantra> Binding self with thoughts of self. || 40 ||
[1794] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[1795] <tantra> The following-enter yogin:
[1796] <tantra> Dwells in whatever ground of faith,
[1797] <tantra> Doing conduct of faith,
[1798] <break> <tantra> Placing hope in the first ground.
[1799] <break> <prose> I do not speak that itself as liberated.
[1800] <tantra> The nature-definite yogin:
[1801] <tantra> Meditates one-pointedly, variously not-thinking,
[1802] <tantra> Possesses the nature of not-thinking.
[1803] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated. || 50 ||
[1804] <tantra> The appearance-mind yogin:
[1805] <tantra> All arisen from my mind,
[1806] <tantra> Realizing mind-itself, what is there to do?
[1807] <tantra> Thus expressing all,
[1808] <tantra> I do not speak as liberated.
[1809] <tantra> The enter-action yogin:
[1810] <tantra> Regards accomplishing the action of meaning itself,
[1811] <tantra> Those bound by great action,
[1812] <tantra> Do action-generating the first mind,
[1813] <tantra> From that grasping action all, || 60 ||
[1814] <tantra> Accomplishing all doing.
[1815] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[1816] <tantra> The action-cause yogin:
[1817] <tantra> Raises the path of tantra itself,
[1818] <tantra> Hoping in cause, relying upon cause,
[1819] <tantra> Manifestly showing cause itself.
[1820] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[1821] <tantra> The doer-condition yogin:
[1822] <tantra> Seeks authentic meaning through conduct,
[1823] <tantra> Holds the not-same side of caste, || 70 ||
[1824] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[1825] <tantra> The end-arrive-fruit yogin:
[1826] <tantra> Carries the path of realization,
[1827] <tantra> Does not dwell in ground-path,
[1828] <tantra> From seeing self that-ness,
[1829] <tantra> Is regarded as great authentic liberation.
[1830] <tantra> The authentic meaning yogin:
[1831] <tantra> Also obtains self-realization,
[1832] <tantra> In pure bardo-appearance,
[1833] <tantra> From seeing authentic self, || 80 ||
[1834] <tantra> Is regarded as end-arrive liberated.
[1835] <tantra> The end-arrive liberation yogin:
[1836] <tantra> The certainty-obtaining yogin,
[1837] <tantra> In the ground itself of certainty-obtaining,
[1838] <tantra> From seeing obtain self that-ness,
[1839] <tantra> Is regarded as beyond authentic ground.
[1840] <tantra> The done-complete yogin:
[1841] <tantra> Is the primordially-pure great Buddha;
[1842] <tantra> From that gone, I do not speak.
[1843] <tantra> In the four great yogins, || 90 ||
[1844] <tantra> I do not speak ground-purify,
[1845] <tantra> I do not speak path-traverse.
[1846] <prose> Thus.
[1847] <prose> That also: by different manner of path-meditation,
[1848] <prose> Here direct light-clear doing, below newly-enter, although ground-path purify-traverse not-need speak
[1849] <prose> Self path: with gate-three defilement and with-attachment aggregate, and
[1850] <prose> Moving thought, and
[1851] <prose> By needing to purify coarse wind-mind mind,
[1852] <prose> When those are pure: below ground-path incidentally complete, signs dawn.
[1853] <prose> Above complete by below incidentally complete become—aim in one great-completion. || 100 ||
[1854] <prose> Purify-traverse not-need speak.
[1855] <tantra> Ground one: rigpa spontaneously-accomplished,
[1856] <tantra> In all-doing,
[1857] <tantra> Rigpa spontaneously-complete, not-transform not-purify.
[1858] <tantra> Thus like.
[1859] <ornament> Third: in the definite supreme place, generally showing the distinction of the yogin, and
[1860] <tantra> From two in individual explanation of vessel-possess.
