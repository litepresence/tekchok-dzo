[16769] <prose> First, the essence.
[16770] <prose><tantra> From blue.
[16771] <prose> The five colors spread, and the five lights' rim rounds the inner petal, together like an under-barrel house appearance.
[16772] <prose> Awareness, the snake-noose ray-shooting fence, arises.
[16773] <prose> This bindu of the light house moves through a slight small part.
[16774] <prose><tantra> From the blazing lamp.
[16775] <prose> Completely, and through the sphere of the lamp.
[16776] <prose> The essence of awareness gathers.
[16777] <prose> The snake-noose fence appears.
[16778] <prose> This, to whoever is familiar, is that very meaning itself. || 10 ||
[16779] <prose> Blue, unchanging, self-luminous.
[16780] <prose> The rim of the fence abides.
[16781] <prose> Self-luminous, the outer object appears.
[16782] <prose> The essence itself is unfabricated.
[16783] <prose> Thus it is.
[16784] <prose> Therefore, also, when focusing on the sky, first from the straight-drawn sky-blue of the treasury-brow, great light pervades and arises.
[16785] <prose><tantra> From that inner, the five colors arise.
[16786] <prose> Also, from the two corners of the eye, rainbows arise like errors.
[16787] <prose><tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[16788] <prose> <tantra> Like the rainbow of the sky. || 20 ||
[16789] <prose> <tantra> Pure, afflictions and stains exhausted.
[16790] <prose> <tantra> The sphere is vast, and the expanse uncut.
[16791] <prose> <tantra> Through completely pure reality, the object.
[16792] <prose> <tantra> Making arise from both objects.
[16793] <prose> <tantra> Pervading great blue, change nonexistent.
[16794] <prose> <tantra> Meeting the condition of pure appearance.
[16795] <prose> <tantra> Becoming together with the five colors.
[16796] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[16797] <prose> Second, the definition.
[16798] <prose> Through Rigpa, the self-object and appearance, through display-ground-doing, through the expanse. || 30 ||
[16799] <prose> Through completely pure nonexistent defilement, as object-appearance.
[16800] <prose> Through the chain-circle going-space grasp, from appearance-awareness, through clarifying, through the lamp.
[16801] <prose> <tantra> From the former.
[16802] <prose> <tantra> Through the expanse, through Rigpa, the self-object does.
[16803] <prose> <tantra> The vajra itself, chain-circle.
[16804] <prose> <tantra> Through entering inside this itself, doing.
[16805] <prose> <tantra> Through self, essence as thought-not.
[16806] <prose> <tantra> Also through inside, through the expanse, going-space.
[16807] <prose> <tantra> Indeed through not-grasping, nonabiding manner.
[16808] <prose> <tantra> Appearing as continuous as nonexistent separation. || 40 ||
[16809] <prose> To aspect-object as appearance.
[16810] <prose> Exhausted limit of number through pure defilement.
[16811] <prose> Through the lamp, the vajra chain-circle.
[16812] <prose> Indeed, stare-release to space itself.
[16813] <prose> Doing through appearing as nonexistent nature.
[16814] <prose> Through that meaning, grasping.
[16815] <prose> As definitive-term through nature itself.
[16816] <prose> Abiding as nonexistent gather-separate from-beginning.
[16817] <prose> Thus it is.
[16818] <prose> If divided through three, from three. || 50 ||
[16819] <prose> Therefore, through abiding at ground, through completely pure expanse, the lamp inside tsitta at pristine awareness and light, through body spontaneous-presence inside clear abiding.
[16820] <prose> Through appearing at path, through completely pure expanse, the lamp through the five rims' enclosure surrounding the center possessing lotus petal, through essence gathering of bindu.
[16821] <prose> Through appearing at fruit-object, through completely pure expanse, the lamp through bound chain-circle grasping, through the web and half-web of five lights.
[16822] <prose> Projection below design, etcetera.
[16823] <prose> Also from the blazing lamp.
[16824] <prose> Three divide-aspects exist.
[16825] <prose> Through abiding at ground, through pure expanse.
[16826] <prose> Through Rigpa, as pristine awareness body grasping.
[16827] <prose> Through appearing at path, through the expanse indeed.
[16828] <prose> Through Rigpa, essence gathering of bindu. || 60 ||
[16829] <prose> Through appearing at object, through the expanse indeed.
[16830] <prose> That chain-circle bound as grasping.
[16831] <prose> Through dividing all through that.
[16832] <prose> Thus it is.
[16833] <prose> Indeed four natures.
[16834] <prose> Moreover, through abiding as self-face primordially pure, through enclosure of expanse, as Rigpa inserts, through naked-straight equal intention, through great self-ease, through meditation state set-down.
[16835] <prose> Through spontaneous-presence primordial-resonance, from appearance, from space to projection below wall-house etcetera, through many appearances appearing indeed.
[16836] <prose> Intention, ka-pure and spontaneous-accomplish, two nonexistent, this nature.
[16837] <prose><tantra> From that.
[16838] <prose> Through unceasing nature-appearance. || 70 ||
[16839] <prose> All actual memory ceases.
[16840] <prose> Self-pure appearance into space.
[16841] <prose> Also to Awareness of nonexistent thought.
[16842] <prose> Through knowing nonmoving equality.
[16843] <prose> Also into space of all-ceasing.
[16844] <prose> Primordial thought-ceasing.
[16845] <prose> Abiding in completely pure nature space.
[16846] <prose> Through two nonexistent express and appearance-word.
[16847] <prose> Also into space of nonexistent outer and inner.
[16848] <prose> Abiding in the state of great self-ease. || 80 ||
[16849] <prose> Thus it is.
[16850] <prose> Five characteristics.
[16851] <prose> Empty clear open of outer light space.
[16852] <prose> Abiding primordially in ka-pure open of Self-Awareness space.
[16853] <prose><tantra> From that.
[16854] <prose> Through open through nonexistent outer-inner.
[16855] <prose> Unobscured, nonexistent stain.
[16856] <prose> Also in great primordial ka-pure.
[16857] <prose> Through completely pure space.
[16858] <prose> Abiding as primordial characteristics. || 90 ||
[16859] <prose> Through nonexistent this, nonexistent object of Awareness.
[16860] <prose> Nonexistent ceasing-appearance.
[16861] <prose> The lamp of aspect-sound.
[16862] <prose> Thus it is.
[16863] <prose> Six habituate-manner.
[16864] <prose><tantra> From cut distinction of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, put body-speech natural-place.
[16865] <prose> Manifest face-introduce, in space's fence, through making experience abiding ten Awareness day-night nonexistent.
