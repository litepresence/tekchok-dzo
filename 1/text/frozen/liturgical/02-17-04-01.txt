[2064] <ornament> First:
[2065] <prose> The conduct of the cause-characteristics vehicle.
[2066] <prose> Though entering the common path, merely engaging in conduct without swift liberation through that conduct alone.
[2067] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[2068] <verse> The conduct of non-clinging grasping,
[2069] <verse> Is the conduct of the characteristics vehicle;
[2070] <verse> Bound by great attachment through meaning, || 2070 ||
[2071] <verse> Without method, how could liberation come?
[2072] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2073] <ornament> Second:
[2074] <prose> The general conduct of Secret Mantra: though method exists, dwelling in effort and accomplishment, swift liberation does not come.
[2075] <prose> Also from that same source:
[2076] <verse> The conduct without negation or affirmation,
[2077] <verse> Is the outer-inner conduct of Secret Mantra;
[2078] <verse> Not desiring to stop afflictions,
[2079] <verse> Not desiring to accomplish primordial wisdom.
[2080] <verse> The conduct of word-meaning connection, || 2080 ||
[2081] <verse> Not non-attachment through meaning,
[2082] <verse> Distinction superior through existing method,
[2083] <verse> Great method grasping-conduct thus.
[2084] <verse> That conduct's yoga also,
[2085] <verse> Is not the conduct of true nature.
[2086] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2087] <ornament> Third:
[2088] <prose> The spontaneously accomplished conduct of Great Perfection.
[2089] <prose> In the nature, without acceptance or rejection, grasping or effort, abiding in accordance with that, transcending like space directions and divisions, abiding as great primordial liberation and primordial conduct.
[2090] <prose> Also from the Self-Arisen: || 2090 ||
[2091] <verse> Conduct without attachment to clinging,
[2092] <verse> Is the Ati conduct of Great Perfection;
[2093] <verse> Without doing to be done, without done, without ground of arising,
[2094] <verse> Without going, without coming, without dwelling,
[2095] <verse> Without clinging, without attachment.
[2096] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2097] <ornament> Second, extensively explaining the certain conduct of Great Secret—two aspects:
[2098] <prose> Extensively explaining the nature of twenty-one conducts,
[2099] <prose> And the sequence of performing vajra song and dance.
[2100] <ornament> First, from the Sun-Mouth-Joining Tantra: || 2100 ||
[2101] <verse> Through conduct like the bee,
[2102] <verse> Savor the taste of all dharmas.
[2103] <verse> Through conduct like the deer,
[2104] <verse> Abandon objects that become causes of delusion.
[2105] <verse> Through conduct like the mute,
[2106] <verse> Completely abandon the words of delusion.
[2107] <verse> Through conduct like the peacock,
[2108] <verse> Cut doubts regarding secret mantra.
[2109] <verse> Through conduct like the madman,
[2110] <verse> Abandon objects of singular dwelling. || 2110 ||
[2111] <verse> Through conduct like the lion,
[2112] <verse> Abandon fearful mind, go to charnel grounds.
[2113] <verse> Through conduct like the dog and pig,
[2114] <verse> Abandon concepts of pure and impure.
[2115] <verse> Through conduct like the owl,
[2116] <verse> Practice immediate mind-thought.
[2117] <verse> Through conduct like the child,
[2118] <verse> Abandon long attachment to delusion.
[2119] <verse> Through conduct like the elephant,
[2120] <verse> Guide with words agreeable to the world. || 2120 ||
[2121] <verse> Through conduct like the great elephant,
[2122] <verse> Turn from the depths of saṃsāra's battles.
[2123] <verse> Through conduct like the deer,
[2124] <verse> Abandon concepts of child and enemy.
[2125] <verse> Through conduct like the doe,
[2126] <verse> Determine the time for contentment with desires.
[2127] <verse> Through conduct like the she-bear,
[2128] <verse> Do not spread the seeds of saṃsāra.
[2129] <verse> Through conduct like the brahmin,
[2130] <verse> Abandon others' enjoyments as food. || 2130 ||
[2131] <verse> Through conduct like the heroine,
[2132] <verse> Distinguish the boundaries of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[2133] <verse> Through conduct like the fish,
[2134] <verse> Place the support of mindfulness in its own place.
[2135] <verse> Through conduct like the space-vajra,
[2136] <verse> Practice open presence toward all phenomena.
[2137] <verse> Through conduct like the intermediate-space wind,
[2138] <verse> Abandon the thought of grasping and holding.
[2139] <verse> Through conduct like the garuḍa,
[2140] <verse> Cut precipices with waves. || 2140 ||
[2141] <verse> Through conduct like the mountain,
[2142] <verse> Practice upward the unchanging self-purity.
[2143] <verse> Through conduct like the great vajra,
[2144] <verse> Practice without turning back appearance.
[2145] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2146] <prose> Though there are twenty-two enumerations, the two deer-like conducts are combined into one by division, thus explained as twenty-one.
[2147] <ornament> Second, the sequence of performing vajra song and dance—three aspects:
[2148] <prose> The time of song and dance,
[2149] <prose> Song and dance itself,
[2150] <prose> The benefits of song and dance. || 2150 ||
[2151] <ornament> First:
[2152] <prose> The time of conduct distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundaries, and
[2153] <prose> Feast gathering, and
[2154] <prose> Empowerment, and
[2155] <prose> The time of maṇḍala accomplishment, and
[2156] <prose> The time of elevating samādhi higher—these five, when pure, are hidden from ordinary perception, thus performed:
[2157] <tantra> From that same source:
[2158] <verse> Whatever yogin is fortunate,
[2159] <verse> When wandering in charnel grounds,
[2160] <verse> Again and again perform the vajra song, || 2160 ||
[2161] <verse> Companion of non-conceptual samādhi abiding.
[2162] <verse> Going before all conduct,
[2163] <verse> Therefore perform the vajra song itself.
[2164] <verse> Entering feast, empowerment, and maṇḍala,
[2165] <verse> At that time, strive in song.
[2166] <verse> When depending on the non-conceptual tantra,
[2167] <verse> This very one should be performed at that occasion.
[2168] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2169] <prose> Especially explained as supreme for settling the mind and clearing dullness:
[2170] <tantra> From that source: || 2170 ||
[2171] <verse> Whoever arrives at samādhi,
[2172] <verse> Through this one arrives at settling;
[2173] <verse> If the yogin becomes dull,
[2174] <verse> Through this, if excited, samādhi is good.
[2175] <verse> Self-aware great bliss strikes with expanse,
[2176] <verse> Joined with mahāmudrā itself.
[2177] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2178] <ornament> Second, song and dance itself—body ritual, mind meditation, and speech action, three aspects:
[2179] <prose> Body ritual: implements and dance, two aspects.
[2180] <prose> That also: when entering feast and maṇḍala, and when elevating samādhi, || 2180 ||
[2181] <prose> From whichever peaceful or wrathful implements:
[2182] <prose> Peaceful: adorned with silk and jewel ornaments, clothes rustling,
[2183] <prose> Peaceful crown ornament, and
[2184] <prose> Holding vajra and bell.
[2185] <prose> Wrathful implements:
[2186] <prose> Six bone ornaments, great ash smearing,
[2187] <prose> Corpse stripes,
[2188] <prose> Bandha, and
[2189] <prose> Holding phurba.
[2190] <prose> Dance: arranging the deity's mudrā. || 2190 ||
[2191] <prose> Speech: reciting mantra and essence.
[2192] <prose> Mind: meditating the deity's body.
[2193] <prose> Especially when distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundaries,
[2194] <prose> Body naked, abiding ordinarily,
[2195] <prose> Performing various mudrās and various dances,
[2196] <prose> Speech and mind also likewise.
[2197] <prose> In forests, lake-groves, and so forth, when elevating experience higher,
[2198] <prose> From yogin's body implements:
[2199] <prose> Ḍāmaru, and
[2200] <prose> Bell, and || 2200 ||
[2201] <prose> Flute, and so forth, blowing, adorned with flower head-ornaments, and so forth,
[2202] <prose> Mind meditating the deity's body, and
[2203] <prose> Training directly in rigpa face-introduction, and
[2204] <prose> Abiding in self-abiding samādhi, these three elevated,
[2205] <prose> From foot dance and right-extend left-draw,
[2206] <prose> To left-extend right-bend, and so forth, transforming,
[2207] <prose> Speech action: long and short vowels and consonants,
[2208] <prose> Spoken with pleasant sound, crooked,
[2209] <prose> Drawing nose-breath of Oṃ, Ā, Hūṃ, He, Lye, and so forth,
[2210] <prose> Performing the unsurpassable supreme secret vajra words: || 2210 ||
[2211] <prose> E ma ki ri ki ri,
[2212] <prose> Maṣṭa bāli bāli,
[2213] <prose> Sa mi ta pu ru pu ru,
[2214] <prose> Ku ta li ma su ma su,
[2215] <prose> I kā ra su li bha ta ye,
[2216] <prose> Tsa ki ra bhu li sa la ye,
[2217] <prose> Sa mun ta tsar ya su bha yai,
[2218] <prose> Bhe ta sa bha ya ku le yai,
[2219] <prose> Sa kā ri dhu kā na,
[2220] <prose> Ma ta rai bai ta na, || 2220 ||
[2221] <prose> Ba ra li hi sā na,
[2222] <prose> Ma khar ta ki la nāṃ,
[2223] <prose> Saṃ bha ra ta me ka tsaṅ taṃ pa,
[2224] <prose> Sur ya ta ra e pa śa na pa,
[2225] <prose> Ra na bhi ti sa bhu ra lā pa,
[2226] <prose> Ma smin sa gu li ta ya pa,
[2227] <prose> Gu ra gu rā sa ga kha ra na lī,
[2228] <prose> Na ra na rā i thar pa ṭā la,
[2229] <prose> Sir na sir ṇe bhe sa ras pa laṃ,
[2230] <prose> Bhun rda bhun rda tshi ṣa sa ke laṃ, || 2230 ||
[2231] <prose> Sa sā,
[2232] <prose> Ri rī,
[2233] <prose> Li lī,
[2234] <prose> Ā āī,
[2235] <prose> Mi mī,
[2236] <prose> Ra rā rā.
[2237] <prose> Thus from the Sun-Mouth-Joining, taking the dharmatā song, the intent of Samantabhadra father-mother:
[2238] <verse> Because unborn, not ceasing,
[2239] <verse> Pervading all without going or coming,
[2240] <verse> Great bliss, supreme dharma, unmoving, || 2240 ||
[2241] <verse> Equal to space, liberation without stain.
[2242] <verse> Without root, without support,
[2243] <verse> Without dwelling, without taking, great dharma,
[2244] <verse> Primordially liberated, spontaneously equal, vast and great,
[2245] <verse> Without binding, without complete untying.
[2246] <verse> Pervading-vast mansion, primordially existent essence,
[2247] <verse> Pervading without decline, completely transcending.
[2248] <verse> Vast and great, O space expanse,
[2249] <verse> Great dharma blazing, sun-moon maṇḍala.
[2250] <verse> Spontaneously accomplished, directly apparent, || 2250 ||
[2251] <verse> Vajra mountain, great lotus,
[2252] <verse> Sun lion, primordial wisdom song,
[2253] <verse> Great sound, music without equal,
[2254] <verse> Enjoying in the limit of space,
[2255] <verse> Buddha Buddha all equal,
[2256] <verse> Samantabhadra, vast dharma peak.
[2257] <verse> In the expanse-depth of the good space-expanse,
[2258] <verse> Clear expanse, spontaneously complete, primordially complete and great.
[2259] <prose> Thus the meaning.
[2260] <prose> Taking from the pervading-vast vast state of mind itself. || 2260 ||
[2261] <ornament> Third, the benefits of song and dance:
[2262] <tantra> From the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[2263] <verse> That also is the chief method of yoga,
[2264] <verse> Through soundless vajra song,
[2265] <verse> Satisfying the minds of all Buddhas,
[2266] <verse> Companion of yogins' experience,
[2267] <verse> Capturing the minds of ḍākinīs,
[2268] <verse> Turning the attachment of the six lineages of saṃsāra,
[2269] <verse> The ground of gathering for the fortunate,
[2270] <verse> Self-settling the mind-streams of all, || 2270 ||
[2271] <verse> Striking the clear aspects of self-aware bliss,
[2272] <verse> Making the army of singular awareness,
[2273] <verse> Clearing the faults of mind-possessors,
[2274] <verse> Purifying the obscurations of body-possessors,
[2275] <verse> Giving empowerment, samaya, and bliss,
[2276] <verse> Suppressing ignorance through purity,
[2277] <verse> The ground of rest for all vehicles,
[2278] <verse> The juncture of view and meditation connection,
[2279] <verse> The field for taming all essences,
[2280] <verse> The ground of self-arisen Akṣobhya appearance, || 2280 ||
[2281] <verse> Also holding the body of Vajrasattva.
[2282] <prose> Thus and:
[2283] <tantra> From the Vajra Secret Song:
[2284] <verse> To close the gates of lower realms through need,
[2285] <verse> Is the activity of Buddha itself.
[2286] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2287] <ornament> Third, conduct of definite sequence seizing the time—three aspects:
[2288] <prose> Conduct of those beginning the practice, and
[2289] <prose> Conduct distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundaries, and
[2290] <prose> Conduct raised upon the path of vows and conduct. || 2290 ||
[2291] <ornament> First: The ten of writing letters, worship, and so forth.
[2292] <tantra> From the Middle Extremes:
[2293] <verse> Writing letters, worship, giving, and
[2294] <verse> Hearing, reading, holding, and
[2295] <verse> Explaining, recitation, doing, and
[2296] <verse> Contemplating that, meditating—
[2297] <verse> These ten dharma-actions,
[2298] <verse> Merit's heap is immeasurable.
[2299] <prose> Thus progressively train.
[2300] <ornament> Second: Taking profound instructions into experience and as preliminary to the third empowerment, through body, speech, and mind conduct, distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, actualizing the conduct of settling rigpa. || 2300 ||
[2301] <ornament> Third: From the twenty-one explained, here mainly the first seven are practiced.
[2302] <prose> That also: first, gathering all dharma gates, directly orienting the tantra, seeking meaning in one direction of experience.
[2303] <prose> Like the bee seeking its house,
[2304] <prose> Hearing distinguishes dharma from non-dharma,
[2305] <prose> Contemplating realizes that meaning, suppressing afflictions,
[2306] <prose> Meditating places realization instantly, extracting afflictions from the root.
[2307] <tantra> From the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[2308] <verse> Wisdom of hearing cuts outer superimposition, and
[2309] <verse> Wisdom of contemplating cuts inner superimposition, and
[2310] <verse> Wisdom of meditating cuts secret superimposition. || 2310 ||
[2311] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2312] <prose> As companion to that, without doubt, like entering the peacock house before cutting superimposition, without confusion coming,
[2313] <prose> Cutting hearing and contemplating superimposition finished, taking into experience instructions of self-confident recognition.
[2314] <prose> As companion to that, not in the domain of all, conduct like the deer:
[2315] <prose> That yogin, fearing falling into saṃsāra, through shame, not going among people, dwelling alone in the mountains, taking into experience—like the deer hunted, hiding alone through shame.
[2316] <prose> As companion to that, conduct like the mute:
[2317] <prose> Ceasing speech, speaking with no one.
[2318] <prose> Thus doing, rigid memory, conduct like the madman:
[2319] <prose> Body, speech, and mind conduct without planetary attachment, arising spontaneously like a madman.
[2320] <prose> At this time, without pure or impure, conduct like dog and pig arises: || 2320 ||
[2321] <prose> Enjoying food and clothes without choosing whatever.
[2322] <prose> Thus when the six are complete, not overwhelmed by others' manner, suppressing outward, conduct like the lion arises:
[2323] <prose> As the lion has no fear or anxiety toward anything,
[2324] <prose> So this yogin, free from harm of all appearances, humans and non-humans, power to transform whatever arises.
[2325] <prose> When these conducts are given personal names, it is called the conduct of transforming appearance.
[2326] <prose> That also: able to transform others' power, and
[2327] <prose> Able to restore killing, and
[2328] <prose> Accomplishing miracles, and
[2329] <prose> Dharmatā experience blazing, like alcohol intoxication, free from fear in any direction,
[2330] <prose> Power to transform the four elements arises. || 2330 ||
[2331] <ornament> Second, that instruction: the method of direct placement of appearance, seeing whatever appears directly upon appearance, mind itself directly placed.
[2332] <prose> Like snow falling on rock-salt,
[2333] <prose> Upon appearance-top, that itself self-instant spontaneously goes.
[2334] <prose> That also: arising appearance,
[2335] <prose> Ceasing appearance,
[2336] <prose> Coming and going appearance, and so forth—training in phenomena as different pieces, liberating grasping attachment, appearance although true, empty as reflection, and
[2337] <prose> Water-moon, and
[2338] <prose> Sound-echo, and
[2339] <prose> Emanation, and
[2340] <prose> Illusion, and || 2340 ||
[2341] <prose> Mirage, and
[2342] <prose> Optical illusion, and
[2343] <prose> Dream horse completely pure,
[2344] <prose> Training in dharmatā unborn, the general form of dharmas, realizing like space, primordially peaceful.
[2345] <tantra> From the Six Vastnesses:
[2346] <verse> In the mind-itself where arising exists,
[2347] <verse> Through six realms appearance self-dawning,
[2348] <verse> Grasping different forms,
[2349] <verse> Appearance matures, completing as form.
[2350] <verse> In the mind-itself where ceasing exists, || 2350 ||
[2351] <verse> Through impermanent cause self-dawning,
[2352] <verse> In appearance without nature,
[2353] <verse> Completing like example dream.
[2354] <verse> In the mind-itself where elaboration exists,
[2355] <verse> Through various appearance self-dawning,
[2356] <verse> In individual appearance of five gates,
[2357] <verse> Completing from ground grasping self-ground.
[2358] <verse> In the mind-itself where showing exists,
[2359] <verse> Through sound words names self-dawning,
[2360] <verse> Concepts minds self-pure, || 2360 ||
[2361] <verse> Guru instruction secret complete.
[2362] <verse> In the mind-itself where seeing exists,
[2363] <verse> Through many arisen conditions self-dawning,
[2364] <verse> In manifest appearance objects,
[2365] <verse> Completing as unmixed self-clear.
[2366] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2367] <ornament> Third, from that the aim of appearance-existence ground rising dawns:
[2368] <prose> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas all, though not trained, spontaneously dawn upon the mind-top instantly, without obstruction whatever,
[2369] <tantra> Also from that same source:
[2370] <verse> Again in the mind-itself without existence, || 2370 ||
[2371] <verse> Appearance free from hope and fear,
[2372] <verse> Called confidence-possessing primordial placement aim,
[2373] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[2374] <verse> In the mind-itself without appearance aspect,
[2375] <verse> Singular, minute, fine appearance,
[2376] <verse> Called great elaboration-free aim,
[2377] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[2378] <verse> Thus aim within aim,
[2379] <verse> Mind also definitely established by,
[2380] <verse> Yogin obtains power over mind, || 2380 ||
[2381] <verse> Liberated from defilement binding.
[2382] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2383] <ornament> Fourth, at that time, the fruit transforming aggregates and afflictions ground:
[2384] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[2385] <verse> Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields,
[2386] <verse> Liberate into family and family lord.
[2387] <prose> Thus and:
[2388] <verse> Because conditions liberate through conditions,
[2389] <verse> I do not rely upon object dharmas.
[2390] <verse> In objects liberating through objects, || 2390 ||
[2391] <verse> I do not rely upon the two of grasping and holding.
[2392] <verse> In cause itself liberating through cause,
[2393] <verse> I do not rely upon the two of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[2394] <verse> In dharmas liberating through dharmas,
[2395] <verse> I do not rely upon concept words.
[2396] <verse> In mind-itself liberating through mind,
[2397] <verse> I do not rely upon indicating mind.
[2398] <prose> Thus and:
[2399] <tantra> From the Six Vastnesses:
[2400] <verse> In the mind-itself of six-aggregates appearance, || 2400 ||
[2401] <verse> Thought-assemblies self-place pure.
[2402] <verse> In the mind-itself of sound word appearance,
[2403] <verse> Concept names self-place pure.
[2404] <verse> In the mind-itself of coarse appearance,
[2405] <verse> Four elements' conditions self-place pure.
[2406] <verse> In the mind-itself of grasping-holding appearance,
[2407] <verse> Binding self-grasp pure.
[2408] <verse> In the mind-itself of existence appearance,
[2409] <verse> Phenomena self-place pure.
[2410] <verse> In the mind-itself of non-existence appearance, || 2410 ||
[2411] <verse> Emptinesses self-place pure.
[2412] <verse> In the mind-itself of existence and non-existence,
[2413] <verse> Established extremes self-place pure.
[2414] <verse> In the mind-itself of dharma appearance,
[2415] <verse> Self characteristic pure.
[2416] <verse> In the mind-itself of non-dharma appearance,
[2417] <verse> Delusions self-place pure.
[2418] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2419] <ornament> Second topic: yogin progressively doing meditation—four aspects:
[2420] <prose> Day-night mouth-joining meditation, || 2420 ||
[2421] <prose> Its instruction: ocean relax method,
[2422] <prose> Its aim: appearance-existence ground-place dharmatā,
[2423] <prose> Its fruit: afflictions self-vanquished.
[2424] <ornament> First, three aspects:
[2425] <tantra> From the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[2426] <prose> Meditation is three: deity and so forth mind meditation, and
[2427] <prose> Mahāyāna samādhi, and
[2428] <prose> The intent of all Buddhas of the three times.
[2429] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2430] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 2430 ||
[2431] <verse> What arises from descended nature,
[2432] <verse> Is called pure samādhi.
[2433] <verse> Channels, winds, and bindus, and
[2434] <verse> Body piths, eyes, and emptiness,
[2435] <verse> Are considered meditation.
[2436] <verse> Letters, lights, colors, and
[2437] <verse> Various emanating gathering,
[2438] <verse> In samādhi explanation,
[2439] <verse> Non-fabricated self-place natural state,
[2440] <verse> How that is unchanging, || 2440 ||
[2441] <verse> Is the intent of all Buddhas.
[2442] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2443] <ornament> Regarding that, first, deity and mother's meditation: twenty-one mind-holdings.
[2444] <tantra> From that same source:
[2445] <verse> Through twenty-one mind-holding training stages,
[2446] <verse> First: placing in the ground, and
[2447] <verse> Second: separating body-mind, and
[2448] <verse> Third: seeing dharmatā.
[2449] <verse> At this time, body, speech, and mind piths,
[2450] <verse> Yogins possessing should settle. || 2450 ||
[2451] <verse> Moving wind horse and,
[2452] <verse> Mixed, throwing and gathering by,
[2453] <verse> Skillfully relying upon three piths,
[2454] <verse> Mind's thought continuum ceases.
[2455] <prose> Thus spoken meaning, taking into experience in three aspects.
[2456] <prose> First seven-set places self-mind in ground dwelling;
[2457] <prose> Second separates body-mind grasping attachment;
[2458] <prose> Third shows seeing dharmatā.
[2459] <ornament> First, the seven-set characteristic: holding mind on white A is:
[2460] <prose> Ground mind suitable, sitting on comfortable cushion, body in cross-legged posture, || 2460 ||
[2461] <prose> Meditating one white A shining at nose-tip,
[2462] <prose> When wind goes out, A also goes out;
[2463] <prose> When drawing in, A also comes in—think thus, mix with wind, meditate.
[2464] <prose> That also: if heat disease exists in body, think that A cold touch;
[2465] <prose> For cold disease, think hot touch, train day and night,
[2466] <prose> Experience of mind free from emanating and gathering, uncommon, arises.
[2467] <prose> Body pith, wind pith—all equal.
[2468] <prose> If dull in that, holding mind on letter Pha: breath one, awareness distractedly put,
[2469] <prose> Saying Phaṭ fiercely, awareness thought-free ha-de-ba one comes, until thought not arisen, hold mind, also Phaṭ, train day and night, thought-free emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation arises.
[2470] <prose> Also holding mind on wrathful pleasure laughter: || 2470 ||
[2471] <prose> Saying Ha fiercely short, like before, place mind, thought-free clear resonance experience arises.
[2472] <prose> Holding mind on asura quarrel dispute:
[2473] <prose> Sitting at mountain-peak or rock-top, and so forth,
[2474] <prose> Body hunched, head first, slowly rolling,
[2475] <prose> Slowly moving the body.
[2476] <prose> Thus doing three or four days,
[2477] <prose> Forcefully rolling by element force, moving,
[2478] <prose> Outer appearance red blood turbid, and
[2479] <prose> Yellow flickering, and
[2480] <prose> Green wavering, and || 2480 ||
[2481] <prose> Dissolving, and
[2482] <prose> Blue-clear becoming after,
[2483] <prose> Outer appearance self-ceasing, seeing nothing established as any essence,
[2484] <prose> Experience of seeing-appearance self-liberated arises.
[2485] <prose> At this time, rely upon food suitable for wind.
[2486] <prose> Place mind on letter Raṃ at navel.
[2487] <prose> Holding mind on Hūṃ expelling thought: Hūṃ with long vowel, mixed with wind, hold mind not distracted elsewhere from that nature,
[2488] <prose> Occasionally saying short Hūṃ, experience of thought purified into dharmatā arises.
[2489] <prose> Likewise, meditating Raṃ at navel, accorded with wind and body pith, and
[2490] <prose> Meditating deity's body, || 2490 ||
[2491] <prose> Placing mind on subtle body creating from nose-tip and pore gates, experience of great clear pure awareness arises.
[2492] <ornament> Second, seven-set forehead pith separating body-mind grasping attachment:
[2493] <prose> Wind and body pith as before,
[2494] <prose> Holding mind on white-red mixed bindu at eyebrow-center, pea-lobe size.
[2495] <prose> Through that, wind experience arises.
[2496] <prose> In body center, three channels straight like stick, skeleton nose two nose-holes exist, hold wind from there,
[2497] <prose> Shooting like arrow, demons, obstacles, sins, obscurations purified.
[2498] <prose> Drawing in like hook, entering central mother-nose,
[2499] <prose> Three channels, four wheels, filled with wisdom wind, holding mind there, rigpa emptiness-clear experience arises.
[2500] <prose> From nose-tip, white wind, arrow, from mile to krośa distance, draw two, out go, in come, hold mind, thought-free clear experience arises. || 2500 ||
[2501] <prose> Body given, five lights fence, rainbow-like, clear, not blur, not scatter, not dissipate, not distract, hold mind, light-clear pure experience arises.
[2502] <prose> Shooting wind-mind into sky-space from,
[2503] <prose> Letter or light sphere or sun-moon maṇḍala, increasingly high, increasingly high, finally sinking into expanse, invisible state, holding mind by that means, emptiness without thought-face experience arises.
[2504] <prose> Placing mind on ear, holding simultaneously, sound samādhi experience arises.
[2505] <prose> Holding mind on subtle deity body inside heart, light-clear pure experience arises, and intermediate light clear matures, deity body ring-sel rainbow lights arise.
[2506] <ornament> Third seven-set showing seeing dharmatā:
[2507] <prose> Holding mind on gradual emptiness:
[2508] <prose> First, cool body parts with many,
[2509] <prose> Analyze with many names, and so forth,
[2510] <prose> Even head alone, cool with many names, || 2510 ||
[2511] <prose> When that name examined for meaning, meaning becomes atom, seek where that name abides,
[2512] <prose> When not found, anything mind non-moving, emptiness depth displaying, search without anger, memory, thought, simultaneously place, experience of emptiness non-dual arises.
[2513] <prose> Apply to all appearances as body is.
[2514] <prose> Holding mind on instantaneous emptiness:
[2515] <prose> Whatever appears, intensely viewed, think emptiness clear clear clear gone,
[2516] <prose> Train in all form appearance, sound appearance, and so forth, experience like mirror struck with Ha arises.
[2517] <prose> Holding mind on impermanence: training appearance without fixation,
[2518] <prose> Whatever appears without fixation, various appearance not true, boundaryless, impermanent, think, train,
[2519] <prose> Liberation experience of planetary fixation separation arises.
[2520] <prose> Whatever appears of five elements, awareness just-big, non-distracted placing, || 2520 ||
[2521] <prose> Liberation experience arises there, like dream.
[2522] <prose> Holding mind on non-thought: whatever appears, awareness whatever becomes, moment continuum partless, thought-free, primordially abiding, recognize that, gather, reach, train, thought-free self-abide great meditation arises.
[2523] <ornament> Holding mind on union:
[2524] <prose> When two appear, grasping two arises, view that self greatly, self-purify, non-dual great experience arises, and
[2525] <prose> Through father-mother bliss path doing, also bliss-emptiness non-dual experience arises.
[2526] <prose> Doing intermediate space path:
[2527] <prose> Meditate rigpa dissolving dissolving into intermediate space, and
[2528] <prose> All appearance-mind in sky expanse, quiescent, whatever supportless, meditate, and
[2529] <prose> Meditate sky and all dharmas equal,
[2530] <prose> Experience of extreme-free great emptiness arises. || 2530 ||
[2531] <prose> That meaning also from the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[2532] <prose> Placing mind on letter A:
[2533] <verse> Phenomena attachment self-place reverses.
[2534] <verse> Placing mind on created deity,
[2535] <verse> Purifies body's stains.
[2536] <verse> Through vajra song of speech,
[2537] <verse> That satisfies the mind.
[2538] <verse> Placing mind on letter Hūṃ,
[2539] <verse> That purifies speech stains.
[2540] <verse> Who holds mind on Raṃ, || 2540 ||
[2541] <verse> That purifies all phenomena.
[2542] <verse> Who abides on letter Ha,
[2543] <verse> Ceases all ignorance.
[2544] <verse> Whoever abides mind on Phaṭ,
[2545] <verse> That abandons body-speech harm.
[2546] <verse> Whoever meditates bindu at eyebrow-center,
[2547] <verse> Through this becomes familiar with wind.
[2548] <verse> Holding mind on stick's essence,
[2549] <verse> That blocks sense doors.
[2550] <verse> Who familiarizes mind at nose-tip, || 2550 ||
[2551] <verse> Elements arising self-place gather.
[2552] <verse> Whoever meditates body support self-light,
[2553] <verse> Through this becomes familiar with bardo ground.
[2554] <verse> Who shoots mind to sky,
[2555] <verse> Through this becomes familiar with emptiness.
[2556] <verse> Whoever holds mind at ear,
[2557] <verse> Through this enjoys sounds as wished.
[2558] <verse> Whoever holds mind at heart,
[2559] <verse> Through this thoughts self-place purify.
[2560] <verse> Whoever abides in emptiness, || 2560 ||
[2561] <verse> Through this phenomena attachment ceases.
[2562] <verse> Whoever meditates emptiness sudden,
[2563] <verse> All memories instantly empty.
[2564] <verse> Whoever trains impermanence mind,
[2565] <verse> Through this turns saṃsāra attachment.
[2566] <verse> Whoever holds mind on five elements,
[2567] <verse> Through that body signs arise.
[2568] <verse> Whoever meditates non-conceptual wisdom,
[2569] <verse> Through this marks attachment ceases.
[2570] <verse> Whoever meditates union bliss, || 2570 ||
[2571] <verse> Through this does desires as path.
[2572] <verse> Whoever does intermediate space path,
[2573] <verse> Through this also obtains power over mind.
[2574] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2575] <prose> Incidental to these, methods of holding mind on appearance objects—form, sound, smell, taste, touch, five—also:
[2576] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[2577] <verse> Eye form, sound, smell, taste, and touch,
[2578] <verse> The five desire objects are trained.
[2579] <verse> Forms: colors, shapes,
[2580] <verse> Craft and various arts, || 2580 ||
[2581] <verse> Optical illusions, and so forth, various.
[2582] <verse> Sounds: lute, vase-drum,
[2583] <verse> String instruments, clay drum, flute, and
[2584] <verse> Pheng, har, and so forth.
[2585] <verse> Smells: fragrance and incense,
[2586] <verse> Mind-suitable, profound dependent connection.
[2587] <verse> Tastes: possessing six molasses,
[2588] <verse> Grape wine, various mixtures,
[2589] <verse> Dependent connection limb joining.
[2590] <verse> Touch: sitting on expert's throne, || 2590 ||
[2591] <verse> Text-folded joined element, and
[2592] <verse> Some tree leaves,
[2593] <verse> Merely touching dharmatā,
[2594] <verse> Mind abides without separation.
[2595] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2596] <prose> Especially, the sequence of four protections as yoga is also explained from that source.
[2597] <tantra> From that source:
[2598] <verse> The sequence of training three kāyas,
[2599] <verse> Taking element qualities as chief,
[2600] <verse> Especially training in sounds of earth, water, fire, and wind, || 2600 ||
[2601] <verse> Certainly accomplish through training.
[2602] <verse> Explaining water sound:
[2603] <verse> Holds the song-sound of ḍākinīs,
[2604] <verse> If constantly familiarized with this,
[2605] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya is certainly accomplished.
[2606] <verse> Earth sound: cool and heavy,
[2607] <verse> Possessing sound of great Brahmā,
[2608] <verse> If constantly hearing and training in this,
[2609] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya is certainly accomplished.
[2610] <verse> Training in fire sound: || 2610 ||
[2611] <verse> Shows the speech-sound of great Viṣṇu,
[2612] <verse> Whoever uses this for hearing,
[2613] <verse> Certainly obtains dharmakāya qualities.
[2614] <verse> Wind sound: piercing and resounding,
[2615] <verse> Speech of joining the garuḍa king,
[2616] <verse> If knowing to constantly recite this,
[2617] <verse> Train commonly in three kāyas.
[2618] <verse> Thus the meaning of four element sounds,
[2619] <verse> Definitely apply to outer time:
[2620] <verse> Winter, spring, summer, autumn seasons, || 2620 ||
[2621] <verse> Water and earth, fire and wind,
[2622] <verse> Connect definitely to time in sequence,
[2623] <verse> If yogin accords with body,
[2624] <verse> Accomplishment comes, no doubt.
[2625] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2626] <prose> Thus summarizing the meaning of deity and human mind-holdings:
[2627] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[2628] <verse> Deity and human mind-holding,
[2629] <verse> Restraining nose-mouth breath,
[2630] <verse> Thought-free mind unmoved, || 2630 ||
[2631] <verse> Is the nature of singular-pointed awareness,
[2632] <verse> Spoken as without instantaneous thought.
[2633] <verse> Cannot indicate great true meaning.
[2634] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2635] <ornament> Second, regarding bodhisattva samādhi—two aspects:
[2636] <prose> Divisions themselves, and
[2637] <prose> Incidental arising.
[2638] <ornament> First, two aspects:
[2639] <prose> Brief presentation:
[2640] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen: || 2640 ||
[2641] <verse> Bodhisattva samādhi,
[2642] <verse> Is held by mind,
[2643] <verse> Arisen by nature or force,
[2644] <verse> Through familiarity becomes expanse, and
[2645] <verse> Abandons food concept.
[2646] <verse> Practiced by ground-dwellers,
[2647] <verse> Thought-free by nature.
[2648] <verse> That also cannot indicate great meaning.
[2649] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2650] <prose> That also: the meaning of awareness is clear light, not merely non-conceptual abiding, — therefore cannot indicate great meaning. || 2650 ||
[2651] <ornament> Extensive explanation—three aspects:
[2652] <prose> Natural force samādhi:
[2653] <prose> Arising spontaneously as non-conceptual by nature, merely settling body and speech.
[2654] <prose> Continuum-support object samādhi:
[2655] <prose> Meditating antidote to afflictions coarse and subtle without nature as view, merely suppressing afflictions.
[2656] <prose> Ground-dwelling samādhi:
[2657] <prose> Samādhi of ground's actual basis, merely purifying own-ground propensities.
[2658] <tantra> Also from the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[2659] <verse> Mahāyāna samādhi,
[2660] <verse> Through natural force samādhi, || 2660 ||
[2661] <verse> Unfabricated body and speech settle.
[2662] <verse> Through continuum-support samādhi,
[2663] <verse> Instantaneous affliction heads are suppressed.
[2664] <verse> Through ground-dwelling samādhi,
[2665] <verse> Own-continuum sustenance is done.
[2666] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[2667] <ornament> Second, showing samādhi arising from clear light—two aspects:
[2668] <prose> Natural, and
[2669] <prose> Fabricated samādhi.
[2670] <ornament> First, natural samādhi: || 2670 ||
[2671] <prose> Arising in all sentient beings when awareness distracts to propensities, from quivering and dwelling, and
[2672] <prose> Exists in sharpshooter's eye, and
[2673] <prose> In hare and bird sleeping eyes, and so forth.
[2674] <prose> Briefly: exists at all times when consciousness-mind distracts to propensities.
[2675] <ornament> Second, fabricated samādhi:
[2676] <prose> All samādhi, samādhi of non-conceptual and conceptual deity creation-completion, and so forth, fabricated by mind, intended by mind.
[2677] <prose> Here, established as three according to need:
[2678] <prose> That also: for yogins, immediately harmed by food and clothes,
[2679] <prose> In depth, harmed by dream and propensities circulating in three realms,
[2680] <prose> As antidotes to those: cutting food attachment samādhi session, || 2680 ||
[2681] <prose> Cutting clothes attachment samādhi session,
[2682] <prose> Cutting dream and propensities attachment samādhi session—train in these three.
[2683] <prose> That also: here, explaining view cutting continuum, progressively practicing yogin—four aspects.
[2684] <prose> View city continuum-cut,
[2685] <prose> Its instruction: mountain all-placement method,
[2686] <prose> Its aim: three realms complete liberation,
[2687] <prose> Its fruit: afflictions ground-purified.
[2688] <ornament> First, two aspects:
