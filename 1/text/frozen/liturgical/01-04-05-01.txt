[2849] <ornament> First: All phenomena including the container world and contained beings of appearance and existence arranged by intellect are the false conventional.
[2850] <prose> Because appearance manifests as the essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness.
[2851] <prose> Those also imputed appearances arise as appearances accordant with the function of deluded intellect.
[2852] <prose> They possess the power to function causally.
[2853] <prose> When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence—
[2854] <prose> In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:
[2855] <list> Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,
[2856] <list> As before explained:
[2857] <list> Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] <list> Like a gandharva city in the sky, || 10 ||
[2859] <list> Thus they arise, thus they abide,
[2860] <list> Thus also they cease.
[2861] <prose> Thus is the false conventional.
[2862] <prose> The true conventional:
[2863] <prose> Though appearing deluded, it serves as the cause of blissful migration and ultimate liberation.
[2864] <prose> The white virtuous actions of the ten virtues,
[2865] <prose> The collections of merit such as generosity and so forth,
[2866] <prose> Gathered through the path of truth by means of the mind's samādhi of wisdom, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, serving as the field of experience for intellect.
[2867] <prose> From the Uttaratantra Commentary:
[2868] <tantra> "All paths of truth are compounded. || 20 ||
[2869] <tantra> All compounds are merely conventional.
[2870] <tantra> That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—the essence of emptiness—along with the subsequent measuring wisdom, the peaceful aspect free from elaboration, is the ultimate truth."
[2871] <prose> Divided: the nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate.
[2872] <prose> These two: the non-nominal ultimate and the truly authentic ultimate.
