[3994] <prose> First, through error not experienced, ignorance's continuum is pure,
[3995] <prose> Now, not dwelling in error, the ground of action and affliction is empty,
[3996] <prose> Later, error becomes impossible, the cord of action's virtue and sin is cut.
[3997] <prose> Self-nature without difference—the ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is one,
[3998] <prose> Error is completely pure,
[3999] <prose> Characteristic: without error's cause, the three realms are tossed like a sack.
[4000] <prose> The third essence: || 4000 ||
[4001] <prose> The ground of falling-doers empty, the unobtainable ground is held,
[4002] <prose> Self-nature beyond calculation—even as merely non-error, without establishment,
[4003] <prose> Characteristic: duality not established, error and non-error separated.
[4004] <prose> The third is the essence of bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration, without many parts,
[4005] <prose> Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading.
[4006] <prose> Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut.
[4007] <prose> That is divided into two:
[4008] <list> The ear lineage and
[4009] <list> The explanation lineage.
[4010] <prose> The essence of the ear lineage: connected one-to-one, especially near itself. || 4010 ||
[4011] <prose> That too: self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others,
[4012] <prose> Characteristic: without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation.
[4013] <prose> Divided into many: with syllables and
[4014] <break> <prose> Without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.
[4015] <break> <prose> The essence of the explanation lineage:
[4016] <prose> Dharmatā without action, without cause, without ground to reverse the three realms,
[4017] <prose> Self-nature:
[4018] <prose> Clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms,
[4019] <prose> Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.
[4020] <prose> This is divided into four: || 4020 ||
[4021] <list> The outer cycle,
[4022] <list> The inner cycle,
[4023] <list> The secret cycle,
[4024] <list> The unsurpassable secret cycle.
[4025] <prose> The essence of the outer cycle:
[4026] <prose> Without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles,
[4027] <prose> Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā,
[4028] <prose> Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.
[4029] <prose> The essence of the inner cycle: not possessing form, the markless dharmatā,
[4030] <prose> Self-nature without coming or going, the wisdom always dwelling at all times, || 4030 ||
[4031] <prose> Characteristic: from the aspect of solidity, arising like a root,
[4032] <tantra> From the aspect of twisting, arising like a trunk, from the aspect of clarity, arising like a flower,
[4033] <tantra> From the aspect of ripening, arising like a fruit.
[4034] <prose> The essence of the secret cycle is explained:
[4035] <list> Pointing out and
[4036] <list> Realization attained simultaneously, depending completely on the three: hearing, contemplation, and meditation,
[4037] <prose> Self-nature: breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously, depending completely on effort, establishment, and familiarization-power,
[4038] <prose> Characteristic: buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously, depending completely on accumulation and merit.
[4039] <prose> The essence of the unsurpassable secret cycle is explained:
[4040] <prose> Not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom. || 4040 ||
[4041] <prose> The self-nature is explained:
[4042] <prose> Directly seeing, not dwelling in the intellect-grasping view.
[4043] <prose> Characteristic: the measure of four appearances arrived at, the result of three bodies and five wisdoms not aimed at.
[4044] <tantra> From that, this is the unsurpassed secret:
[4045] <prose> Below, through dharmatā's intellect-confidence reaching,
[4046] <prose> Here, through the guru's power, existing as the direct object of the senses—specially superior.
[4047] <prose> Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary:
[4048] <break> <list> These Great Perfections: nine in the expanse,
[4049] <break> <list> Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4050] <list> Three sections, || 4050 ||

[4060] <tantra> From the definitive conclusion, || 4060 ||
[4061] <tantra> From the nature of Great Perfection,
[4062] <prose> Word-distinctions emanate.
[4063] <tantra> From the three sections, nine expanses become,
[4064] <break> <tantra> From the word summary, ślokas,
[4065] <break> <tantra> From fourteen hundred-thousand,
[4066] <prose> Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4067] <break> <prose> Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4068] <break> <prose> The spoken object equal to the sky's end,
[4069] <prose> Cutting the thoughts of disciples and beings,
[4070] <tantra> From this, the spoken object abbreviated, || 4070 ||
[4071] <prose> To one hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4072] <prose> Summaries one and a half thousand,
[4073] <prose> Three thousand great gathered essential points,
[4074] <prose> To forty thousand deviation-obstacles,
[4075] <tantra> Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4076] <prose> The sequence of word-speaking clearly established.

[4150] <prose> Thus establishing the general manner of dharma's enumeration, || 4150 ||
[4151] <prose> Now explaining the unsurpassable vehicle in particular,
[4152] <tantra> Through knowing the nature of the Tantra section,
[4153] <prose> And the definite basis arising from that—these two must be realized.
[4154] <tantra> The nature of the Tantra section: three,
[4155] <tantra> Briefly showing the summary of Tantra,
[4156] <prose> Extensively explaining that nature,

[4164] <list> Validities.
[4165] <tantra> First, the essence of Tantra:
[4166] <prose> Awareness and that certainty brought to certainty—the great secret, cannot add or remove, definite.
[4167] <prose> Definite terms:
[4168] <tantra> For the purpose of indicating lineage, Tantra,
[4169] <tantra> Making whatever lineages arise—thus Tantra,
