[175] <prose> Having first received the path from Samantabhadra, generating bodhicitta, thus arose.
[176] <prose><tantra> Thus Samantabhadra's purpose-accomplishment through Tantra is called.
[177] <prose> In certain treatises this sequence appears:
[178] <prose><tantra> From Buddha comes dharma, from dharma come the arya hosts.
[179] <prose> Such is the meaning of this order.
[180] <ornament> Second: Regarding Vajradhara's manner of obtaining peace in this field—
[181] <prose> Some say from the first Protector
[182] <prose><tantra> Beings of different tantras generate mind—this view is invalid,
[183] <prose> For the Magical Vairotsana declares:
[184] <prose> <tantra> "First Buddha, Buddha of earth, || 10 ||
[185] <prose> <tantra> Great hero and great destroyer"—
[186] <prose> <tantra> Thus.
[187] <prose> <tantra> "This teacher is Vajradhara,
[188] <prose> <tantra> Buddha before all Buddhas"—
[189] <prose> <tantra> Thus spoke the Bhagavan, contradicting that view.
[190] <prose> Therefore, for the purpose of beings in this field; in the first time, through Samantabhadra's own emanations; displaying as ordinary beings generating mind; then demonstrating Buddhahood and opening the great play of enlightened activity.
[191] <prose> Such manner is also renowned in common sutras.
[192] <prose><tantra> From the Meeting of Father and Son:
[193] <prose> <tantra> "Great hero, skilled in skillful-means,
[194] <prose> <tantra> For the complete ripening of sentient-beings, || 20 ||
[195] <prose> <tantra> Though becoming Buddha ten-million times,
[196] <prose> <tantra> Still you guide, O Teacher,
[197] <prose> <tantra> Demonstrating many Buddhas"—
[198] <prose> <tantra> Thus.
[199] <prose><tantra> From the Flower Ornament:
[200] <prose> <tantra> "Having attained the ocean of supreme enlightenment,
[201] <prose> <tantra> For the complete ripening of the ocean of sentient-beings,
[202] <prose> <tantra> Demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation,
[203] <prose> <tantra> Showing the ocean of conduct undiminished through all time—
[204] <prose> <tantra> Such is the emanation of the Sugatas." || 30 ||
[205] <prose> <tantra> Thus spoke the Bhagavan.
[206] <prose> Therefore, the first Protector, intending to tame this realm, displayed through emanations that manner of mind-generation.
[207] <ornament> Regarding this Fortunate Eon, before immeasurable eons past,
[208] <prose> In the field called "Self-Nature Completely Arranged,"
[209] <prose> To Buddha Flower-Great-Beauty offered one golden vajra, generating supreme bodhicitta as the first mind.
[210] <prose> Thus, then in the second birth, in the north, "Wind-Movement Arranged," becoming householder Good-Give's son called Jewel-Garland,
[211] <prose> Dwelt near Buddha Wheel-Well-Conduct, hearing Dharma.
[212] <prose> Then passed beyond, born as a son called "Lightning-Light" in the Bliss-Intoxicated Island, the brahmin youth Good-Give.
[213] <prose> At that time, heard Dharma from Buddha Good-Intelligence for five years, and for seven years abided in single-pointed samadhi.
[214] <prose> At seventy-five years, demonstrated manifest complete Buddhahood upon the peak of the mountain called "Jewel-Precious-Heap-Arranged." || 40 ||
[215] <prose> Having dwelt for one great eon in the meaning of dharma-body,
[216] <prose> Then self-arose as the Victor's enjoyment-complete body in ornament and color wheel.
[217] <prose><tantra> From the spreading-gathering of light-rays, arose thirty-six self-arisen tantras.
[218] <prose> 
[219] <prose><tantra> From the bindu of light, abiding, established sixty complete perfections,
[220] <prose> Buddha-bodies hundred-thousand countless, inexpressible, self-appearing;
[221] <prose><tantra> From the tongue-faculty of those appearing as five-family Buddhas, immeasurable light-rays radiate forth, all through the proclaimed sound of self-arisen six syllables, compassion without activity radiates in ten directions.
[222] <prose><tantra> From that very state, Buddha Vairochana the great manifest, body with principal and retinue countless, dharmatā Samantabhadra's complete enjoyment gathering,
[223] <prose> Great Perfection's body blazes with light.
[224] <prose> Likewise Akṣobhya, the immovable Buddha of the eastern direction, || 50 ||
[225] <prose> Ratnasaṃbhava, the jewel-born Buddha of the southern direction,
[226] <prose> Amitābha, the boundless light Buddha of the western direction,
[227] <prose> Amoghasiddhi and so forth, each with individual mandalas and retinues countless and inexpressible,
[228] <prose> Gathering in his own complete enjoyment, each Buddha's Great Perfection body blazes with light.
[229] <prose> At that time, in Light-House completely pure, supremely well-arranged upper dwelling,
[230] <prose> Teacher Completely Pure, Self-Knowing Awareness King, Vairochana Gang-chen-mtsho by name,
[231] <prose> Became lord of all mandalas.
[232] <prose> Body-speech-mind without fabrication, precious teaching's state unmoving,
[233] <prose> Non-arising,
[234] <prose> Non-abiding, || 60 ||
[235] <prose> Non-taking,
[236] <prose> Non-rejecting,
[237] <prose> Non-moving itself self-arisen.
[238] <prose> At that time, the tamer of those not to be tamed, with precious beautiful retinue assembly hundred-thousand countless,
[239] <prose><tantra> From his own body emanating forms,
[240] <prose><tantra> From speech proclaiming sounds,
[241] <prose><tantra> From mind radiating awareness,
[242] <prose><tantra> From qualities displaying virtues,
[243] <prose> Activities themselves radiate and gather.
[244] <prose> Thus all appearances—upper || 70 ||
[245] <prose> And lower,
[246] <prose> Ten directions' worlds—not being,
[247] <prose> All completely pure, dense arrangement, blissful field, self-appearance completely pure, self-arisen Buddha-field clearly became.
[248] <prose><tantra> From that very appearance-aspect, marks and characteristics complete, the arising of Vajradhara's qualities complete body:
[249] <prose><tantra> From offering a vajra as basis for mind-generation arose this manifestation.
[250] <prose> That pure merit causes the body to appear without inherent nature,
[251] <prose> The accumulations are pure and complete,
[252] <prose> Mind's great wisdom conducts all aspects as spontaneously known.
[253] <prose> Thus in dharmakāya time, when place, dharma-sphere, object, and thought are completely pure,
[254] <prose> Teacher Samantabhadra's natural activities are all complete, perfectly accomplished and abides. || 80 ||
[255] <prose> Furthermore, upon one particle of retinue, particles-number Buddhas countless, with actual nature teaching, dzogchen dharma-nature vajra whoever—all uncompounded.
[256] <prose> When viewing dharma-nature, pure conduct and the five perfections abide.
[257] <prose> In this time, the thirty-six inexhaustible activities of body, speech, and mind's ornament-wheel manifest.
[258] <prose> The body's four outer activities are these:
[259] <prose> Unchanging in nature, without alteration,
[260] <prose> Uncoming from any source or origin,
[261] <prose> Ungoing to any destination or end,
[262] <prose> Non-abiding in any location or state.
[263] <prose> The four inner activities:
[264] <prose> Non-appearing to ordinary perception, || 90 ||
[265] <prose> Non-doing through lack of inherent existence,
[266] <prose> Non-radiating beyond conceptual elaboration,
[267] <prose> Non-gathering as empty of self-nature.
[268] <prose> The four secret activities:
[269] <prose> Clear-open like the nature of space,
[270] <prose> Even as equality without discrimination,
[271] <prose> Loose from all binding concepts,
[272] <prose> Direct as spontaneous self-awareness.
[273] <prose> Speech's four outer activities:
[274] <prose> Inexpressible through ordinary words, || 100 ||
[275] <prose> Unshowable by conventional signs,
[276] <prose> Unseeable by obscured perception,
[277] <prose> Unslightable by conceptual criticism.
[278] <prose> The four inner activities:
[279] <prose> Natural as uncreated dharmatā,
[280] <prose> Passing beyond arising and cessation,
[281] <prose> Objectless without apprehended reference,
[282] <prose> Nonplural as single taste of suchness.
[283] <prose> The four secret activities:
[284] <prose> Fresh as unconditioned awareness, || 110 ||
[285] <prose> Innate as primordial possession,
[286] <prose> Natural as unfabricated presence,
[287] <prose> Unfabricated as spontaneous perfection.
[288] <prose> Mind's four outer activities:
[289] <prose> Stainless samadhi of non-conceptual clarity,
[290] <prose> Lion-display samadhi of fearless confidence,
[291] <prose> Hero-going samadhi of penetrating insight,
[292] <prose> Wish-fulfilling jewel pinnacle samadhi of complete accomplishment.
[293] <prose> The four inner activities:
[294] <prose> Victory-banner peak play of complete mastery, || 120 ||
[295] <prose> Lightning garland of sudden illumination,
[296] <prose> Great wheel of turning all phenomena,
[297] <prose> Light-blazing samadhi of radiant awareness.
[298] <prose> The four secret activities:
[299] <prose> Mudrā's subjugation of dualistic fixation,
[300] <prose> Great-blaze's equality of all appearance,
[301] <prose> Diversity of dharmatā in infinite display,
[302] <prose> Samadhi called "self-appearing spontaneous adornment."
[303] <prose> Those also not the activity of meaning's agent,
[304] <prose> But called "activity" through the arising of qualities' essence and radiance. || 130 ||
[305] <prose><tantra> From that, enjoyment-complete body's self-arising:
[306] <prose><tantra> From the play of unobstructed radiance of former appearances and compassion's arising manner,
[307] <prose> The pure abodes are densely arranged.
[308] <prose><tantra> From the equal-expanse gesture of the great ocean's teacher of complete manifestation—at the lotus-pericarp's base from the thumb, upon the tiny protuberances, upon the layered arrangement of thirty-two realms, the appearances abiding as layered masses, with varied colors and forms like water and moon—
[309] <prose> All layered masses as well, infinite and vast like palace arrangements.
[310] <prose> In arrangements like descending offering-feast houses.
[311] <prose> The bodies of five-family Buddhas as well, all-enumerable in variety.
[312] <prose> In the perfume-water stream below the lotus-throne, infinite.
[313] <prose> The sixteen sixteen realms as well, not as layered masses.
[314] <prose> Like infinite jewel-umbrella arrangements. || 140 ||
[315] <prose> In arrangements like mutual grain-pile masses, also enumerable including five-family Buddhas.
[316] <prose> Furthermore, from all pores of hair-light, radiating into space—also infinite enumerable variety of realms and teachers, boundless, measureless, infinite.
[317] <prose> Thus in enjoyment-body's realm:
[318] <prose> Teaching actual, speech self-arisen syllables whoever not made, yet all teaching's sons and simultaneous appearances those abide—
[319] <prose> At the time of unchanging dharmatā.
[320] <prose><tantra> From the thirty-six self-arisen activities of the enjoyment-body's body, speech, mind inexhaustible ornament-wheel:
[321] <prose> The body's four outer activities:
[322] <prose> Through body appearing without self-nature, obscurations are purified.
[323] <prose> By perfected wisdom face-hand, the body's self-nature is perfected.

[333] <prose> Looking from inside, by outer clarity, the quality of empty aspect is perfected.
[334] <prose> Looking from outside, by inner clarity, the quality of non-duality is perfected. || 160 ||
[335] <prose> By tip pervasively residing in all directions, the quality of non-dwelling without cessation is perfected.
[336] <prose> The four outer deeds of speech:
[337] <prose> By six self-arisen syllables emanating from tongue, immeasurable reality deeds are perfected.
[338] <prose> By entering the father's face, enjoyment of markless dharma is made.
[339] <prose> By emerging from mother's space, engagement with non-dual reality is made.
[340] <prose> By that same emanating and gathering, deeds without nature are perfected.

[349] <prose> By pure mind practice, enjoyment of wisdom knowing all aspects is made.

[358] <prose> By sameness, enjoyment of meaning is performed.
[359] <prose> By discriminating, enjoyment of sense-faculty is performed.
[360] <prose> By action accomplished, enjoyment separate from dharma is performed.

[365] <prose> By abiding in non-dual object-mind, the concept limit of apprehension-apprehender is cut.
[366] <prose> Third, the method of turning the wheel through emanation-body emanation:
[367] <prose> Then from enjoyment-body appearance, gone to emanation-body, those gone having clearly emanated twelve earth teachers in twelve abodes,
[368] <prose> Possessing the nature of five-five perfections.
[369] <prose> At the time of these, also by appearance of three great emanations, benefit to beings is performed.
[370] <prose> By emanation-body in this Jambu continent, place of disciples,

[377] <prose> That also, the mind-support Vajra, from disease-free of those beings wishing to pacify disease,

[381] <prose> This book, writing and holding, possesses liberating activity without effort.
[382] <prose> That body performs liberating activity into clear light when meeting with whichever body.
[383] <prose> Where these exist, one asks.
[384] <prose> They abide in different places by the times of body, speech, mind teachings. || 210 ||

[388] <prose> One five hundred five thousand years.
[389] <prose> Then until ten years of life, the mind-taming teaching,
[390] <prose> One five hundred five thousand years.
[391] <prose> In the interval of those life years, that much year exists but not time,
[392] <prose> The year numbers tamed by those teachings are explained.
[393] <prose> That also, at the time of body teaching, that Vajra exists in the island possessing salty taste, Uddiyana land ocean,
