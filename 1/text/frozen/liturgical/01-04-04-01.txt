[2836] <ornament> First:
[2837] <prose> All phenomena gathered within saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.
[2838] <prose> As the Root Wisdom, Mūlamadhyamakakārikā states:
[2839] <tantra> "The Buddhas taught the Dharma,
[2840] <tantra> Relying correctly upon the two truths:
[2841] <tantra> The conventional truth of the world,
[2842] <tantra> And the ultimate truth of meaning."
[2843] <prose> Thus it is said.
[2844] <tantra> From the Magical Illusion Net Tantra:
[2845] <tantra> "One abides in the manner of the two truths." || 10 ||
[2846] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[2847] <prose> As for this: phenomena marked by characteristics that appear as objects of intellect are the conventional truth.
[2848] <prose> Divided into the false conventional and the true conventional—these two.
