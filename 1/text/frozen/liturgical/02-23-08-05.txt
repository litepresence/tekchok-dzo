[14642] <ornament> The third, wherein that also sets:
[14643] <prose> Through recognizing self-face in the seeing of primordial purity's appearances, the Ground is established.
[14644] <prose> Those of sharp acumen are liberated in an instant among them,
[14645] <prose> while those of lesser acumen dwell long in the Realm, meditating for many days.
[14646] <prose> Like the swiftness of an arrow's flight,
[14647] <prose> like something slow,
[14648] <prose> like something extremely slow—such are their progressive departures.
[14649] <prose> The moment of consummate capacity's completion, within that:
[14650] <prose> Combined with six others' meditation days, recognition should be understood.
[14651] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen: || 10 ||
[14652] <verse> Some are liberated in three moments,
[14653] <verse> Some through the mirror sphere,
[14654] <verse> Some through father and mother,
[14655] <verse> Some through flickering and radiant light,
[14656] <verse> Arising in their own truth, thus liberated,
[14657] <verse> Some through compassionate radiance,
[14658] <verse> Some through two spheres,
[14659] <verse> Some through whatever appears, by Body liberated.
[14660] <verse> Such are the supreme liberation methods.
[14661] <tantra> It is said, and: || 20 ||
[14662] <prose> Moreover, the consummation of supreme capacity:
[14663] <prose> In three moments becoming Buddha, from there Emanations naturally arise.
[14664] <prose> Also, in one moment:
[14665] <prose> The sphere-appearance ceases,
[14666] <prose> In one moment spontaneous presence's appearance ceases,
[14667] <prose> In one moment primordial purity's truth is seen.
[14668] <prose> Moreover, the Emanations are not separate from the ground of primordial purity.
[14669] <prose> Obtaining the suchness of all empowerments upon the Path,
[14670] <prose> Like a shooting star traversing space,
[14671] <prose> That star, emitting radiance, likewise displays Emanations and accomplishes beings' benefit. || 30 ||
[14672] <prose> The benefit can be accomplished in three days.
[14673] <prose> The peak of supreme capacity:
[14674] <prose> Dwells in the intermediate state one day.
[14675] <prose> That also, seeing self-appearance in the appearance of the Four Jñanas conjunction,
[14676] <tantra> From one's eyes arising the two fires of jñana,
[14677] <prose> That shower of weapons all cease from,
[14678] <prose> Appearance arises without cessation,
[14679] <prose> There, awakening to self-knowing,
[14680] <prose> Seeing self-object,
[14681] <prose> Finding certainty in spontaneous presence's ground, || 40 ||
[14682] <prose> Again, it should be known like a shooting star.
[14683] <prose> The supreme of supreme capacity:
[14684] <prose> In two days becomes Buddha,
[14685] <prose> That also, dwelling one day in sphere-appearance,
[14686] <tantra> From one's heart-center, the sun of jñana arises,
[14687] <tantra> From that, light rays spread to the ten directions.
[14688] <tantra> From that, upon each light ray's tip, one Tathāgata Body arises.
[14689] <prose> By that, all appearance objects are seen as Body's nature.
[14690] <prose> Then, finding certainty in spontaneous presence's appearance, Emanations can accomplish benefit in seven days.
[14691] <prose> That also is like a shooting star. || 50 ||
[14692] <prose> The summit of supreme:
[14693] <prose> Dwells three days in the intermediate state.
[14694] <prose> That also, dwelling one day in the sphere,
[14695] <prose> In that, finding certainty, from jñana's appearance a portion of self-appearance arises.
[14696] <prose> That also dwells two days.
[14697] <prose> The first day, light is seen.
[14698] <prose> The second day, Body is seen.
[14699] <prose> That Body is seen as vast and coarse.
[14700] <prose> Having faith in that, finding certainty in spontaneous presence's ground.
[14701] <prose> That also should be known like a shooting star. || 60 ||
[14702] <prose> Emanations also can accomplish benefit in eleven days.
[14703] <prose> The supreme of supreme:
[14704] <prose> Dwells four days in the intermediate state.
[14705] <prose> That also, seeing five spheres clearly arrayed before oneself,
[14706] <prose> In that, awakening to self-propensities, dwells one day in the eastern sphere.
[14707] <prose> Likewise dwells one day in each of the four directional spheres.
[14708] <prose> Then, finding certainty in spontaneous presence, becomes Buddha.
[14709] <prose> Emanations can accomplish benefit in fourteen days.
[14710] <prose> The middling of supreme capacity:
[14711] <prose> Sees after some days. || 70 ||
[14712] <prose> Sees after five days.
[14713] <prose> That is as follows:
[14714] <prose> Four days dwell in the sphere.
[14715] <prose> One day dwell in jñana's appearance.
[14716] <prose> That also, from one's heart-center, light rays arise like horse-drums,
[14717] <prose> That also stands upright in space's expanse.
[14718] <prose> There, holding one's eyes unwavering and gazing,
[14719] <prose> Seeing that one great sphere clearly arrayed in space's center,
[14720] <prose> Faith arises intensely in that.
[14721] <prose> Arising the knowing "This is mine," || 80 ||
[14722] <prose> This is called the instruction "Confidence placing the child in the mother's lap."
[14723] <prose> Then, into that, self-awareness gradually dissolving,
[14724] <prose> This is called the instruction "Irreversible arrow of great scope."
[14725] <prose> Emanations also can accomplish benefit in twenty-one days.
[14726] <prose> The least of supreme capacity:
[14727] <prose> Takes six days.
[14728] <prose> That also, taking four days in the sphere,
[14729] <prose> Taking one day in jñana's appearance and Dharmadhātu,
[14730] <prose> Likewise taking one day in mirror-like,
[14731] <prose> Then from one's two eyes, two clear jñana mirrors arise intensely, || 90 ||
[14732] <tantra> From that, immeasurable appearances spread forth.
[14733] <prose> One sees above oneself as one sphere.
[14734] <prose> One sees before oneself also as one great sphere.
[14735] <prose> Then, obtaining certainty, becomes Buddha.
[14736] <prose> Emanations can accomplish benefit in twenty-five days, it is said.
[14737] <prose> Also, in three moments, each capacity's days differ, liberating in primordial purity's appearance,
[14738] <prose> Obtaining irreversible certainty.
[14739] <prose> When dissolution is incomplete, Emanations separate;
[14740] <prose> However many days Emanations separate, that long dwelling in the Realm,
[14741] <break> <prose> Then Emanations also, like rays gathering at sunset, || 100 ||
[14742] <break> <prose> Gather into Awareness and dissolve into primordial purity's ground.
[14743] <prose> If analyzed with subtle prajñā, there is one great essential point to be understood here.
[14744] <prose> Second, the liberation method of seven middling capacities is five moments.
[14745] <tantra> From the Blazing Body Relic:
[14746] <verse> In the intermediate state of Dharmatā,
[14747] <verse> Liberation occurs in a moment.
[14748] <prose> Thus explained, so:
[14749] <prose> In the first moment, self-appearance individually arises.
