[3870] <ornament> The first: || 3870 ||
[3871] <prose> At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the ground,
[3872] <prose> Even the mere word of elaboration is not established,
[3873] <prose> The elaboration of designation does not exist,
[3874] <prose> In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said.
[3875] <prose> Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted,
[3876] <prose> The ultimate meaning of cessation.
[3877] <ornament> The second:
[3878] <tantra> From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur,
[3879] <prose> At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path,
[3880] <prose> Whatever is not liberated does not exist, || 3880 ||
[3881] <prose> At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.
[3882] <prose> The essence of symbolic instruction: non-deluded, thought-free.
[3883] <prose> Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping.
[3884] <prose> Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.
[3885] <prose> When divided, there are two:
[3886] <list> The oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness,
[3887] <list> The oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.
