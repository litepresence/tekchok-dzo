[685] <prose> From threefold expansion:
[686] <prose> Completion is this:
[687] <tantra> From Self-Arisen,
[688] <prose> In Three Kayas' pure appearance,
[689] <verse> One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] <prose> Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear; || 690 ||
[691] <prose> Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating;
[692] <prose> In concept-free awareness, pure;
[693] <prose> Five light-rays, unceasing and clear;
[694] <prose> In non-grasping great self-liberation,
[695] <prose> Outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
[696] <prose> In action-released awareness,
[697] <prose> Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[698] <prose> In mind-separated awareness,

[703] <prose> Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[704] <prose> Such is Three Kayas' completion manner.
[705] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[706] <prose> Awakening is being without dualistic-grasping aspect—
[707] <tantra> From that same nature:
[708] <verse> Without action, delusion awakens;
[709] <prose> Without concept, afflictions awakens;
[710] <prose> Without grasping, self-arising awakens; || 710 ||
[711] <prose> Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens;

[723] <prose> Without grasping mind, five lights expand;
[724] <prose> In awareness, great wisdom,
[725] <prose> Meaning-possessing self-appearance, fruit expands.
[726] <prose> Such is Three Kayas' expansion manner.
[727] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[728] <ornament> Second: Place expansive explanation.
[729] <list> Dharmakāya,
[730] <list> Sambhogakāya, || 730 ||
[731] <list> Nirmāṇakāya—three places' expansive explanations.
[732] <prose> The first also has:

[757] <prose> Self-body is this:
[758] <prose> Freed from all elaboration extremes, without anywhere accomplishment—
[759] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[760] <verse> Without outer, without inner, without within expanse— || 760 ||
[761] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's self-body.
[762] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[763] <prose> Metaphor is this:
[764] <prose> Like sun through clear-light awareness;
[765] <prose> Like ocean through depth;
[766] <prose> Like lotus, unstained by defects;
[767] <prose> Like mountain, unchanging;
[768] <prose> Like space, vast without boundary or center;
[769] <prose> Like lion, possessing from primordial the confidence surpassing all—
[770] <tantra> From that same nature: || 770 ||
[771] <verse> Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] <prose> Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] <prose> These are Dharmakāya's metaphors.
[774] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[775] <prose> Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[777] <verse> Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's self-sign.
[779] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[780] <prose> Appearance is like sky-expanse's empty-clarity— || 780 ||
[781] <tantra> From that same nature:
[782] <verse> Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's appearance.
[784] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[785] <prose> Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] <tantra> From that:
[787] <verse> Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[788] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's place.
[789] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[790] <prose> Characteristic is this: || 790 ||
[791] <prose> Essence, nature, compassion—three inseparable—
[792] <tantra> From that same nature:
[793] <verse> Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's characteristic.
[795] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[796] <prose> Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[797] <prose> Five lights adorned within, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] <prose> In expanse-awareness great inseparability, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[800] <verse> Clear, luminous, unmixed—three: || 800 ||
[801] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's object.
[802] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[803] <prose> Intent is this:
[804] <prose> View unsevered by direction or side,
[805] <prose> Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[806] <prose> Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
[807] <prose> Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[808] <prose> Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[809] <prose> Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[810] <prose> Moreover from that same nature: || 810 ||
[811] <verse> Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's conduct.
[813] <verse> Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's meditation.
[815] <verse> Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's view.
[817] <verse> Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's fruition.
[819] <verse> Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's enlightened activity. || 820 ||
[821] <verse> One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] <prose> These are Dharmakāya's excellence-qualities.
[823] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[824] <ornament> Second: Sambhogakāya's basis—five expansive explanations:
[825] <list> Essence,
[826] <break> <list> Definitive meaning,
[827] <break> <list> Characteristics,
[828] <list> Appearance mode,
[829] <list> Abiding mode—thus.
[830] <ornament> First: Essence—from Self-Arisen: || 830 ||
[831] <verse> Birth exists, — yet death-free, possessing vajra,
[832] <prose> Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear;
[833] <prose> Possessing five fathers, five fields, five clusters;

[835] <prose> Possessing five bases, five paths, five fruitions,
[836] <prose> Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[837] <prose> This is Sambhogakāya's complete essence.
[838] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[839] <prose> Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[840] <prose> In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered. || 840 ||
[841] <tantra> From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[842] <prose> Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[843] <prose> Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[844] <prose> In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear.
[845] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[846] <prose> Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, green.
[847] <prose> Five kayas:
[848] <list> Essence-expanse Kaya,
[849] <list> Unchanging Vajra-Kaya,

[868] <prose> Five knowledges:
[869] <tantra> From realization's extent,
[870] <list> Know as five kayas, || 870 ||
[871] <list> Know as five wisdoms,
[872] <list> Know as five lights,
[873] <list> Know as self-appearance,
[874] <list> Know as duality-free great liberation.
[875] <prose> Five realizations:
[876] <list> Realize field as expanse,
[877] <list> Realize beings as kayas,
[878] <list> Realize appearance as light,
[879] <list> Realize arise-liberation category-free,
[880] <list> Realize wisdom as rigpa. || 880 ||
[881] <prose> Five bases:
[882] <list> Light-clear basis: rigpa,
[883] <list> Phenomena basis: Kunzhi,
[884] <list> Delusion basis: mind,
[885] <list> Path basis: lamp,
[886] <list> Thought basis: wisdom.
[887] <prose> Five common paths:
[888] <list> Accumulation path,
[889] <list> Application path,
[890] <list> Seeing path, || 890 ||
[891] <list> Meditation path,
[892] <list> No-more-learning path—five.
[893] <prose> Five uncommon paths:
[894] <list> dharmatā path: expanse,
[895] <list> Rigpa path: knowledge,
[896] <list> Light-clear path: two lamps,
[897] <list> Trekcho path: arise-liberation,
[898] <list> Thogal path: expanse-rigpa.
[899] <prose> Five fruitions:
[900] <list> Wisdom fruition: liberated in rig, || 900 ||
[901] <list> Light fruition: delusion-appearance ceases,
[902] <list> Realization fruition: delusion-thought clears,
[903] <list> Self-appearance fruition: brought to exhaustion,
[904] <list> Final fruition: dissolves into expanse.
[905] <prose> Five abodes:
[906] <list> Thigle abode: heart,

[908] <break> <list> Lamp abode: eyes,
[909] <break> <list> Expanse-appearance abode: sky,
[910] <list> Liberation-place abode: primordial purity. || 910 ||
[911] <prose> Five fields:
[912] <list> Rigpa's field: expanse,
[913] <list> Lamp's field: sky,
[914] <list> Wisdom's field: bardo,
[915] <list> Light's field: self-appearance,
[916] <list> Sambhogakāya's field: cluster.
[917] <prose> Five essences:
[918] <break> <list> Rigpa's essence: primordial purity,
[919] <break> <list> Wisdom's essence: spontaneous accomplishment,
[920] <break> <list> Light's essence: five aspects, || 920 ||
[921] <break> <list> Wisdom's essence: realization,
[922] <list> Lamp's essence: empty-clarity.
[923] <prose> Thus in five aspects appearing, some are Sambhogakāya's essence,
[924] <prose> Some are the field,
[925] <prose> Some are the method,
[926] <prose> Some are the appearance,
[927] <prose> Some are wisdom itself—thus Sambhogakāya is explained as one unified essence.
[928] <break> <prose> Second, the etymology:
[929] <break> <prose> Complete with qualities,
[930] <prose> Engaging in pure light-clarity, || 930 ||
[931] <prose> Both benefits spontaneously complete,
[932] <prose> Wisdom arrived at its full measure,

[965] <prose> Essence unchanging, color clear—kaya.
[966] <prose> Nature compassion, directions-arising—kaya.
[967] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[968] <prose> Third, the characteristics:
[969] <prose> Five families' mandalas, unmixed, clear in tone:
[970] <tantra> From Self-Arisen: || 970 ||
[971] <verse> Individual colors unmixed, marks held,
[972] <prose> Marks and exemplary features excellent, light-rays blazing,
[973] <prose> Father, mother, kaya-form held—
[974] <prose> These are Sambhogakāya's characteristics.
[975] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[976] <prose> Fourth, appearance manner:
[977] <tantra> From rigpa's single nature,
[978] <tantra> From expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates to directions performing benefit;
[979] <prose> Rigpa-kaya, unmoving from expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in self-appearance light-clarity field, the inner-outer appearance manner.
[980] <tantra> From that same nature: || 980 ||
[981] <verse> In one nature, two essences—
[982] <prose> This is Sambhogakāya's appearance.
[983] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[984] <prose> Fifth, abiding manner: expanse without acceptance or rejection,
[985] <prose> Space without duality,
[986] <prose> Five complete lights' vast expanse,
[987] <prose> Abiding in emanations-radiating great continuity.
[988] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
