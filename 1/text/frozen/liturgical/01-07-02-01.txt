[9899] <ornament> First, regarding the Body: outer, inner, and secret—
[9900] <prose> Each of these three levels contains outer-outer and the like, three within each,
[9901] <prose> Divided to demonstrate nine aspects; the first three are:
[9902] <tantra> From the Tantra of the Jewel-Heap of Samaya:
[9903] <verse> Regarding the outer samaya of the Body,
[9904] <verse> Examine and divide into three aspects.
[9905] <verse> Taking what is not given pertains to the outer dimension,
[9906] <verse> For this causes the Body's samaya to decline.
[9907] <verse> The sign of this: afflictions of the limbs,
[9908] <verse> Intolerable, various, arising in the body. || 10 ||
[9909] <verse> Sexual misconduct pertains to the inner dimension;
[9910] <verse> The sign: afflictions of the sense-powers.
[9911] <verse> Taking life pertains to the secret dimension;
[9912] <verse> The sign: afflictions of the vital organs.
[9913] <verse> These are experienced by the yogin.
[9914] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9915] <tantra> The ritual for repair, from the Tantra of Supreme Samaya:
[9916] <verse> For the yogin who connects with the signs,
[9917] <verse> Outer-outer: clay images and
[9918] <verse> Image work, seven times. || 20 ||
[9919] <verse> Through this, one is liberated from that negative action.
[9920] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9921] <prose> This also means: erecting seven painted images or clay images of the outer deities purifies.
[9922] <prose> Likewise, if the inner declines: seven clay bodies of the inner deity.
[9923] <prose> For the secret: offering seven or eleven vajras and bells to the teacher repairs, and
[9924] <tantra> From that same source:
[9925] <verse> Seven clay bodies, outer and inner,
[9926] <verse> Erected through the ritual of proper abiding with effort,
[9927] <verse> Should be offered to the supreme teacher.
[9928] <verse> If signs of outer-secret arise, || 30 ||
[9929] <verse> The vajra and bell itself,
[9930] <verse> Nine or eleven, to the teacher.
[9931] <verse> Through this, one is liberated from sickness, and
[9932] <verse> Desires become perfect possessions, and
[9933] <verse> Virtue and pacifying activities are accomplished, and
[9934] <verse> Beings become compassionate.
[9935] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9936] <prose> The three aspects of the inner dimension of the Body: outer, inner, and secret.
[9937] <tantra> From the Golden House Stacked Tantra:
[9938] <verse> The outer of the inner: siblings and also, || 40 ||
[9939] <verse> Whatever father and mother themselves, and
[9940] <verse> One's own body—do not despise these.
[9941] <verse> The inner of the inner: generally, though,
[9942] <verse> In the Dharma of great and small vehicles,
[9943] <verse> Those who wish to enter, have entered, and
[9944] <verse> Those who have entered and hold the image-form body—
[9945] <verse> If one despises these and ornaments of high and low,
[9946] <verse> One deceives all the hundreds of Buddhas.
[9947] <verse> The secret of the inner: one's own body,
[9948] <verse> For it is the mandala of the deity. || 50 ||
[9949] <verse> Mixing poison with medicine and food,
[9950] <verse> Or stabbing with weapons,
[9951] <verse> Taking a hundred bodies without the path of outflow,
[9952] <verse> After that, one experiences the hot hells.
[9953] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9954] <prose> The secret of the Body: outer, inner, and secret, three also.
[9955] <tantra> From that same source:
[9956] <verse> Regarding the outer of the Body's secret:
[9957] <verse> Vajra siblings or sisters,
[9958] <verse> Criticizing the body's ornaments, and || 60 ||
[9959] <verse> Striking with hands in manner of high and low—
[9960] <verse> If one causes another to do this,
[9961] <verse> This also increases the continuum of Avici.
[9962] <verse> The inner: extremely mixed siblings,
[9963] <verse> Even in playful jesting manner,
[9964] <verse> Striking or attempting to strike, or
[9965] <verse> Sporting with the mother even in dreams—
[9966] <verse> If not confessed immediately,
[9967] <verse> This equals the former negative actions.
[9968] <verse> The secret of the secret: the teacher, || 70 ||
[9969] <verse> Do not step over the shadow of the teacher's body, and
[9970] <verse> Even in the pure range of the teacher's eye,
[9971] <verse> One should not hold weapons.
[9972] <verse> Do not stretch legs or lie down,
[9973] <verse> Do not show the back when sitting in posture,
[9974] <verse> Abandon shoes, seats, mounts,
[9975] <verse> Umbrellas, and other playful ornaments.
[9976] <verse> Even in the teacher's bedroom,
[9977] <verse> With hands, weapons, or stones,
[9978] <verse> One should not act. || 80 ||
[9979] <verse> From this, a hundred-thousand-fold,
[9980] <verse> Destroying the teacher's dwelling, and
[9981] <verse> Striking the body and making threats—
[9982] <verse> This negative action is measureless, endless.
[9983] <verse> If through carelessness the teacher
[9984] <verse> Is not served or abandoned, even this is measureless, endless.
[9985] <verse> If one contemns the siblings' bodies,
[9986] <verse> This ripening-result cannot be expressed.
[9987] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9988] <prose> Thus, regarding the samaya of the Body, divided into outer, inner, and secret, there are nine. || 90 ||
[9989] <prose> Second, regarding the samaya of Speech: also three from this.
