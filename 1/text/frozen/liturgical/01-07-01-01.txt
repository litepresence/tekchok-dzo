[9704] <tantra> From the Tantra of Supreme Samaya:
[9705] <tantra> "Samaya is the binding pledge—
[9706] <tantra> The vajra cross, difficult to traverse, certain in aim."
[9707] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9708] <ornament> Regarding the definition:
[9709] <tantra> From that same source:
[9710] <tantra> "Generally, that which is called samaya || 9710 ||
[9711] <tantra> Is the mind itself, unbroken,
[9712] <tantra> Free from all deception and guile."
[9713] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9714] <prose> If classified according to the general system of Mantra,
[9715] <prose> There are two: root samaya and branch samaya.
[9716] <prose> The root consists of the three: Body, Speech, and Mind.
[9717] <prose> The branches are twenty-five,
[9718] <prose> To be known thus:
[9719] <list> To accept,
[9720] <list> Not to abandon, || 9720 ||
[9721] <list> To practice,
[9722] <list> To accomplish—
[9723] <prose> Here, if classified specifically,
[9724] <list> View,
[9725] <list> Conduct,
[9726] <prose> <list> Practice,
[9727] <list> Common,
[9728] <list> Particular Body-Speech-Mind,
[9729] <break> <ornament> Branches,
[9730] <break> <list> And crucial, certain samaya— || 9730 ||
[9731] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[9732] <tantra> "The hundred-thousand-fold spoken samayas,
[9733] <tantra> Briefly taught—well hold these in mind."
[9734] <tantra> Their brief teaching is this:
[9735] <verse> "The samaya of realizing view,
[9736] <verse> The samaya of tantric conduct,
[9737] <verse> The samaya of general practice,
[9738] <verse> The samaya of general commonality,
[9739] <verse> The samaya of Body-Speech-Mind,
[9740] <verse> The samaya of branch enumerations, || 9740 ||
[9741] <break> <verse> And the crucial, certain samaya."
[9742] <break> <prose> These and other samayas
[9743] <prose> Are extensively summarized, great in scope.
[9744] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[9745] <prose> The ground is teacher and student, vajra siblings.
[9746] <tantra> From that same source:
[9747] <tantra> "Inconceivable are these samayas,
[9748] <tantra> Spoken to gather in two aspects:
[9749] <tantra> Teacher and student, these two—
[9750] <tantra> The cause of protection, universally renowned. || 9750 ||
[9751] <tantra> The cause of protection is the teacher;
[9752] <tantra> The one who makes protection is the student."
[9753] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9754] <prose> The vajra siblings are also ascertained as four.
[9755] <tantra> From that same source:
[9756] <tantra> "To the vajra sibling, four meanings are taught:
[9757] <tantra> General, close, mixed, and
[9758] <tantra> Mandala-vase-mixed."
[9759] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9760] <prose> Moreover, all who have entered the teachings in general, and specifically all who have entered Secret Mantra, are general siblings. || 9760 ||
[9761] <prose> Those of one Dharma-family are close siblings.
[9762] <prose> Those gathered by one Guru are mixed siblings.
[9763] <prose> Those upon whom a single empowerment has been bestowed at one time, in one mandala, with one lamp, one vase—these are extremely mixed siblings.
[9764] <prose> These should also be known to become objects of sevenfold strictness.
[9765] <ornament> Regarding the teacher, there is the general teacher honored by all as teacher, and
[9766] <prose> The teacher who draws one to connect with the Dharma oneself,
[9767] <prose> The teacher who bestows samaya and vows, the empowerment teacher,
[9768] <prose> The teacher who gives instruction and transmission—thus four.
[9769] <tantra> From that same source:
[9770] <tantra> "Regarding the teacher, four meanings exist: || 9770 ||
[9771] <tantra> General, drawing, samaya-empowerment,
[9772] <tantra> Instruction-transmission teacher."
[9773] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9774] <prose> The definition of teacher and student is also:
[9775] <tantra> From that same source:
[9776] <tantra> "The definition is thus:
[9777] <tantra> Not-knowing, training to liberate through knowing—
[9778] <tantra> The teacher who connects to Dzogchen meaning;
[9779] <tantra> The student's definition is thus:
[9780] <tantra> Training through listening in undistracted manner— || 9780 ||
[9781] <tantra> The vessel for instruction.
[9782] <tantra> Thus, meaning-endowed teacher and student
[9783] <tantra> Abide equally upon right ground;
[9784] <tantra> If possessing samaya, thus it is."
[9785] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9786] <prose> The benefit of guarding samaya is:
[9787] <tantra> From that same source:
[9788] <tantra> "Abiding in samaya and vow as taught,
[9789] <tantra> Whatever abides in samaya—
[9790] <tantra> All intentions reach their culmination." || 9790 ||
[9791] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[9792] <tantra> From the Magical Illusion:
[9793] <tantra> "Whoever abides in supreme samaya,
[9794] <tantra> By the supreme, most supreme,
[9795] <tantra> Sons and siblings are blessed in intention."
[9796] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9797] <prose> The fault of samaya decline is:
[9798] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[9799] <tantra> "If declined, both will burn;
[9800] <tantra> If body samaya declines, || 9800 ||
[9801] <tantra> One burns in great vajra hell,
[9802] <tantra> Born in the place of wailing cries.
[9803] <tantra> If the teacher declines, without purification method,
[9804] <tantra> Both are born in great wailing-cry.
[9805] <tantra> If the student declines, purification method exists."
[9806] <tantra> If speech samaya declines,
[9807] <tantra> Appearances cease to be, and
[9808] <tantra> One is born in the place of great darkness dust.
[9809] <tantra> Although emerging from that,
[9810] <tantra> One becomes born among the mute. || 9810 ||
[9811] <tantra> If mind samaya declines,
[9812] <tantra> One is born in the place of great mind-disturbance,
[9813] <tantra> Always quarreling, continuum unceasing,
[9814] <tantra> Fighting, suffering, great—
[9815] <tantra> Or one becomes without mindfulness,
[9816] <tantra> Or mindfulness becomes dull,
[9817] <tantra> Madness-demon sickness strikes;
[9818] <tantra> Finally, born in the wailing-cry place."
[9819] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[9820] <tantra> Regarding early signs of deteriorated samaya: || 9820 ||
[9821] <tantra> Unhappiness, various aspects arise;
[9822] <tantra> Epidemic, harming diseases, and
[9823] <tantra> Fever-diseases various arise.
[9824] <tantra> Spirits and misleading ones also,
[9825] <break> <ornament> —
[9826] <break> <tantra> Kill sentient beings, go to hell.
[9827] <tantra> Eyes not see form.
[9828] <tantra> Ears hearing and actions not accomplished.
[9829] <tantra> Leprosy and itch diseases arise.
[9830] <tantra> Thieves, king's punishment arise. || 9830 ||
[9831] <tantra> Others, non-existent fever-disease arises.
[9832] <tantra> Children and wife die—shown.
[9833] <tantra> Lands all, enemies rise, and
[9834] <tantra> Done, meaningless great becomes."
[9835] <tantra> Thus.
[9836] <prose> If deteriorated, from three repair methods:
[9837] <prose> First, the body deteriorated repair method is.
[9838] <tantra> Also from that same source:
[9839] <tantra> "Scripture extensively read, and
[9840] <tantra> Ganacakra extensively turned, || 9840 ||
[9841] <tantra> Three-circles correctly done"—thus spoken.
[9842] <tantra> Thus.
[9843] <prose> Speech also from that,
[9844] <tantra> That also purification method thus:
[9845] <tantra> "Lamp hundred ritual, and
[9846] <tantra> Confess-repair hundred recite, and
[9847] <tantra> Confession aspect various do.
[9848] <tantra> That purified quality see."
[9849] <tantra> Thus.
[9850] <tantra> Confess-repair is Naraka continuous-confession. || 9850 ||
[9851] <prose> Mind also from that same source,
[9852] <tantra> That also purification method thus:
[9853] <tantra> "Teacher please, substance offer,
[9854] <tantra> Wealth-accumulation whatever exists, noble offer.
[9855] <tantra> Thus confession done if,
[9856] <tantra> Thought all accomplish become,
[9857] <tantra> Desire all fulfill become,
[9858] <tantra> Action all complete become."
[9859] <tantra> Thus.
[9860] <prose> The protection method is: || 9860 ||
[9861] <tantra> Fault quality see, mindfulness and awareness pure continuum bind is.
[9862] <tantra> From that same source:
[9863] <tantra> "As-it-is abide in samaya;
[9864] <tantra> Even one aeon, not abandon if—
[9865] <tantra> Samaya great's protection method."
[9866] <tantra> Thus.
[9867] <tantra> That also teacher continuum and samaya's sequence know, ten protect.
[9868] <tantra> Student not-know, teacher's command protect.
[9869] <tantra> Know ten are:
[9870] <list> Word-meaning's place know, and || 9870 ||
[9871] <list> Question's answer expound know, and
[9872] <list> Empowerment and instruction occasion know, and
[9873] <list> View extensive know, and
[9874] <list> Meditate state great know, and
[9875] <list> Reality profound know, and
[9876] <list> saṃsāra with not-mix know, and
[9877] <list> Transcend ground at abide know, and
[9878] <list> Self and general Dharma and Dharma-possessor characteristic know is.
[9879] <tantra> Also from that same source:
[9880] <tantra> That also protection method thus is: || 9880 ||
[9881] <tantra> "Know one distinction,
[9882] <tantra> Distinction ten protection method superior.
[9883] <tantra> One at that from less is.
[9884] <tantra> Samaya king that like engage."
[9885] <tantra> Thus it is.
[9886] <prose> Two: Body-Speech-Mind samaya specific explain is.
[9887] <tantra> From the Consequence:
[9888] <tantra> "Empowerment at depend, samaya explain.
[9889] <tantra> Specific express not-capable although,
[9890] <tantra> Briefly body and speech and mind, || 9890 ||
[9891] <tantra> Yoga body speech mind at apply.
[9892] <tantra> Focus teacher vajra sibling,
[9893] <tantra> Protect place distinguish.
[9894] <tantra> Vow body and empowerment gather.
[9895] <tantra> Vajra secret place hold should is."
[9896] <tantra> Thus speak meaning demonstrate at body samaya and
[9897] <tantra> Speech samaya and
[9898] <tantra> Mind samaya three from,
