[5646] <prose> Sitting with the body generally hunched closes the channel-mouth of consciousness entry.
[5647] <prose> 
[5648] <prose> 
[5649] <prose> 
[5650] <prose> Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow.
[5651] <prose> Joining knee and chest draws ability of wisdom from the body's elements.
[5652] <prose> Crossing the hands at armpit or atop the knee ends the limits of action and latency.
[5653] <prose> Second, the vital of resting wisdom:
[5654] <prose> If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:
[5655] <prose> Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched, || 10 ||
[5656] <prose> There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.
[5657] <prose> Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,
[5658] <prose> Mind abides inward.
[5659] <break> <prose> Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.
[5660] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, heat arises in the outer body,
[5661] <prose> Experience of unborn dharmatā arises inward.
[5662] <prose> Embracing and stretching the nape with the hands
[5663] <break> <prose> Reverses navel action-wind.
[5664] <prose> Through that reversal, many conceptualities cease inward,
[5665] <break> <prose> Increasing fully pure wisdom vision outward. || 20 ||
[5666] <prose> Such vitals are:
[5667] <prose> Body vital is ability,
[5668] <prose> Channel vital is to wind,
[5669] <prose> Wind vital is to mind.
[5670] <ornament> Regarding Sambhogakāya posture also:
[5671] <prose> Sound explanation:
[5672] <verse> "Great elephant" expresses from the part of power and great vehicle, for that body vital lifts special wisdom.
[5673] <prose> Dividing meaning, from the two:
[5674] <prose> The vital of setting continuity:
[5675] <prose> Sleeping face-covered makes power to overcome the three existences. || 30 ||
[5676] <prose> Joining knee and chest makes ground for delusion to dawn as wisdom.
[5677] <prose> Extending the big toe outward to earth harms moving action-wind.
[5678] <prose> Pressing hand fingers to earth
[5679] <prose> Supports dharmatā manifestly dawning.
[5680] <prose> Raising the nape a little makes conceptuality dawn as wisdom.
[5681] <prose> Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5682] <prose> Face-covering overcomes the existence of attachment-holding of three doors.
[5683] <prose> Placing four hands and feet to earth,
[5684] <break> <prose> Pushing outward with the placed foot big-toe reverses conceptuality action-wind.
[5685] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, outer delusion vision ceases, || 40 ||
[5686] <prose> Heat arises in body and mind inward.
[5687] <break> <prose> Pressing both hand-palms to earth reverses moving action-wind.
[5688] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, outer bindus and small bindus dawn,
[5689] <prose> Experience without day and night arises inward.
[5690] <break> <prose> Bending the nape a little reverses grasping action-wind.
[5691] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, seeing outer body-vision,
[5692] <prose> Exhausts wind's movement inward.
[5693] <ornament> Regarding Dharmakāya posture also:
[5694] <prose> Sound explanation:
[5695] <prose> Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything, || 50 ||
[5696] <prose> That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.
[5697] <ornament> Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:
[5698] <prose> The vital of establishing continuity:
[5699] <prose> Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.
[5700] <break> <prose> Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities.
[5701] <break> <prose> Consequently, bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet empties the movement of action and affliction.
[5702] <prose> Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmatā.
[5703] <prose> Carrying channels to the nape makes support without place to stick from dharmatā's meaning.
[5704] <prose> Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5705] <prose> Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl || 60 ||
[5706] <break> <prose> Reverses pervading action-wind.
[5707] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5708] <prose> The continuum of affliction ceases cut inward.
[5709] <break> <prose> Placing both hand-palms inward ceases grasping action-wind.
[5710] <break> <prose> Through that ceasing, seeing outer wisdom vision,
[5711] <prose> The continuum of object-possessor grasping conceptuality ceases inward.
[5712] <prose> Resting the upper body in a gap and stretching the nape
[5713] <break> <prose> Reverses emitting action-wind.
[5714] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[5715] <prose> The continuum of affliction ceases inward. || 70 ||
[5716] <prose> Moreover, pressing the Dharmakāya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.
[5717] <prose> Through pressing Sambhogakāya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.
[5718] <prose> Through pressing Nirmāṇakāya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.
[5719] <prose> Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:
[5720] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5721] <verse> "The door is that itself unmoving."
[5722] <prose> Looking as Nirmāṇakāya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.
[5723] <prose> That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.
[5724] <prose> Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.
[5725] <prose> Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power. || 80 ||
[5726] <prose> Looking as Sambhogakāya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.
[5727] <prose> Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,
[5728] <prose> All delusion ceases in one time.
[5729] <break> <prose> Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmatā.
[5730] <break> <prose> Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness.
[5731] <prose> Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.
[5732] <prose> Looking as Dharmakāya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.
[5733] <prose> Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.
[5734] <prose> Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.
[5735] <prose> Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness. || 90 ||
[5736] <prose> Eye relaxation is the same for all.
[5737] <prose> Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:
[5738] <prose> Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.
[5739] <prose> Bending all finger joints destroys body action.
[5740] <prose> Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner.
[5741] <prose> Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.
[5742] <prose> Second, the three unmoving of speech:
[5743] <prose> Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.
[5744] <prose> 
[5745] <prose> Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom. || 100 ||
[5746] <prose> Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.
[5747] <prose> Third, the three unmoving of mind:
[5748] <prose> Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.
[5749] <prose> Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.
[5750] <prose> Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure.
[5751] <prose> That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—
[5752] <prose> The vital that frees from those.
[5753] <prose> Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:
[5754] <prose> Through three body abidings, separation from action;
[5755] <prose> Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising; || 110 ||
[5756] <prose> Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.
[5757] <prose> First three:
[5758] <prose> Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase saṃsāra's delusion.
[5759] <prose> Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.
[5760] <prose> Placing action at the ground, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening.
[5761] <prose> Second three:
[5762] <prose> Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.
[5763] <prose> Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.
[5764] <prose> Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty ground of holding saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as two.
[5765] <prose> Third, three vision abidings: || 120 ||
[5766] <prose> Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.
[5767] <prose> Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.
[5768] <prose> Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.
[5769] <prose> At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:
[5770] <prose> Arises through obtaining certainty at the ground of four powers.
[5771] <prose> Speech four measures arriving:
[5772] <prose> Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.
[5773] <prose> Mind four measures arriving:
[5774] <prose> Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.
[5775] <prose> That also: at the time of dharmatā manifesting, the body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl, || 130 ||
[5776] <prose> Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.
[5777] <prose> That is the Great Perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.
[5778] <prose> Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,
[5779] <prose> Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.
[5780] <prose> At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness, arises through wind entering the central channel,
[5781] <prose> The Great Perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.
[5782] <prose> Through the pure action of secret empowerment,
[5783] <prose> Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5784] <prose> At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,
[5785] <prose> Arises through mind hitting channels and winds. || 140 ||
[5786] <prose> The Great Perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.
[5787] <prose> Arising through body action purified by wisdom-yeshe empowerment,
[5788] <prose> Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5789] <prose> At exhaustion, the body going like dew on a dakini's ear,
[5790] <prose> Arises through mind entering the luminosity-net.
[5791] <prose> The Great Perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye, through word-empowerment body action purified,
[5792] <prose> Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[5793] <prose> Those are shown nearby by examples—
[5794] <prose> The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.
[5795] <prose> The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning; || 150 ||
[5796] <prose> Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.
[5797] <prose> Speech ground also like the four visions and sequence:
[5798] <prose> Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.
[5799] <prose> This is the Great Perfection's expressive ground, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,
[5800] <prose> Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom.
[5801] <prose> Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:
[5802] <prose> Arises through purifying the self-essence of Great Perfection expressive words.
[5803] <prose> Through entering the resonance of pure certain freedom of Great Perfection expressive words,
[5804] <prose> Cutting elaboration-free meaning inward.
[5805] <prose> Speech going like an earthen jar child emerging from a rock gap, || 160 ||
[5806] <prose> Arises through compassion gathering into wisdom-yeshe power.
[5807] <prose> Through entering the transformation of speech with meaning exceeding Great Perfection's speak-think,
[5808] <prose> Cutting the end of holding words as very elaboration-free.
[5809] <prose> Speech arising like the manner of split rock,
[5810] <prose> Arises through letters abiding in channels entering wind bindus.
[5811] <prose> Through entering the sound of speech with inexpressible Great Perfection meaning,
[5812] <prose> Arises through leaving, exceeding the object of speech, very elaboration-free.
[5813] <prose> Expression arises as inexpressible meaning to example.
[5814] <prose> Mind's four signs also, to be known through the four visions and sequence:
[5815] <prose> Mind going like caught on a dakini's ear, || 170 ||
[5816] <prose> Arises through mixing awareness with luminosity.
[5817] <prose> Great perfection hold-free self-free, entering mind's vision,
[5818] <prose> Arises through completing elaboration-together empowerment.
[5819] <prose> Mind going like a person hit by poison thorns,
[5820] <prose> Arises through freeing into the expanse of unborn mind.
[5821] <prose> Great perfection unborn self-place free, entering mind's arising place,
[5822] <prose> Through completing empowerment of primordially non-existent elaboration.
[5823] <prose> Mind going without return ground like a person recovered from fever,
[5824] <prose> Arises through catching fully pure mind wind.
[5825] <prose> Great perfection primordially free without return ground, entering mind's abiding place, || 180 ||
[5826] <prose> Through very elaboration-free self-vision self-freeing.
[5827] <prose> Mind going like dying immediately after an arrow hits a person's heart,
[5828] <prose> Arises through habituation becoming special.
[5829] <prose> Great perfection momentary quick-doing measure, entering mind's life:
[5830] <prose> Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.
[5831] <prose> This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.
[5832] <prose> Moreover, body's ground, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[5833] <prose> Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.
[5834] <prose> Speech four: express ground,
[5835] <prose> Express condition, || 190 ||
[5836] <prose> Express object,
[5837] <prose> Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[5838] <prose> Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.
[5839] <prose> Mind four:
[5840] <prose> Memory,
[5841] <prose> No memory,
[5842] <prose> Non-arising,
[5843] <prose> Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[5844] <prose> Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.
[5845] <prose> Thus, signs dawning in body, || 200 ||
[5846] <prose> Known in essence-speech,
[5847] <prose> Confidence correcting mind,
[5848] <prose> Measure caught by dream,
[5849] <prose> Through diligence sequence:
[5850] <prose> Great: completely ceasing dreams,
[5851] <prose> Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.
[5852] <prose> Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[5853] <prose> No conceptuality of good or bad latency.
[5854] <prose> Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.
[5855] <prose> Thus the three abidings: || 210 ||
[5856] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng:
[5857] <prose> Abiding is the pure expanse,
[5858] <prose> Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[5859] <prose> Abiding are all visions.
[5860] <prose> Third, striking nails with three obtains:
[5861] <prose> Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[5862] <prose> Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[5863] <prose> Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[5864] <prose> Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."
[5865] <prose> Again from that itself: || 220 ||
[5866] <prose> Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[5867] <prose> Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[5868] <prose> Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.
[5869] <prose> Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[5870] <prose> Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;
[5871] <prose> 
[5872] <prose> 
[5873] <prose> Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;
[5874] <prose> Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into saṃsāra of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;
[5875] <prose> Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvāṇa's self-place. || 230 ||
[5876] <tantra> From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[5877] <prose> Through four great confidences of unchanging view,
[5878] <prose> Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.
[5879] <prose> Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
[5880] <prose> Concluding gathering through sixteen visions:
[5881] <prose> Vision,
[5882] <prose> Increase,
[5883] <prose> Obtain,
[5884] <prose> Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,
[5885] <prose> Completing the sixteen-ground vision: || 240 ||
[5886] <prose> dharmatā manifest vision: increase is eye;
[5887] <break> <prose> Near increase: eye's that itself;
[5888] <break> <prose> Obtain: seeing nadi;
[5889] <prose> Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.
[5890] <prose> Experience increase vision: increase is light;
[5891] <prose> Near increase: bindu;
[5892] <prose> Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;
[5893] <prose> Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.
[5894] <prose> Measure-arrive vision: increase is body;
[5895] <prose> Near increase: vision as father-mother; || 250 ||
[5896] <prose> Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;
[5897] <prose> Near obtain: mandala complete.
[5898] <prose> Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in body and wisdom;
[5899] <prose> Near increase: empty without focus;
[5900] <prose> Obtain: inexpressible;
[5901] <prose> Near obtain: dharmatā not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.
[5902] <prose> Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions, having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,
[5903] <prose> Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."
[5904] <prose> Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result, complete here in freeing as light-body and
[5905] <break> <prose> Freeing in the bardo. || 260 ||
[5906] <break> <prose> 
[5907] <tantra> From the Rig pa rang shar:
[5908] <verse> "Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.
[5909] <prose> In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.
[5910] <prose> That also: that person to whom introduction is shown—
