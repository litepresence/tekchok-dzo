[3922] <prose> Now, again, for those free from elaborations, the excellent path of rigpa's self-appearance—the secret great Vajra Essence—is shown in two aspects:
[3923] <prose> The manner of being definitely superior through surpassing common vehicles,
[3924] <prose> And the explanation of the path itself that possesses distinctions.
[3925] <ornament> First:
[3926] <prose> Through seven pith instructions, this path surpasses all others.
[3927] <list> Other paths, though possessing great wisdom, quickly realize yet liberate only partially; those of lesser wisdom do not liberate. This path, through the pith of direct perception, depends not on effort great or small, nor on sense-powers sharp or dull—thus this is the first pith. || 10 ||
[3928] <list> Others rely on intellectual confidence in self-dharmatā, casting emptiness meditation like a dark stone. This path, not relying on mind's intellectual assessment, directly exists as direct perception—thus not relying on intellect is the pith.
[3929] <list> Others rely progressively on words that express, hoping to primordially realize meaning. This path, not relying on a single letter, directly sees meaning—thus words do not make Buddha, which is the pith.
[3930] <list> Others make the meaning of self-natural-state into a mind-object, relying on time to distinguish ground, path, and fruit. This path, directly becoming self-clear, does not rely on mind-made thought's ground and path—thus buddhahood without reliance is the pith.
[3931] <list> Others, relying before and after on cause and effect, seek enlightenment elsewhere. This path, not relying on good or bad actions of cause and effect, self-dawns enlightenment—thus effort and acceptance-rejection do not exist, which is the pith.
[3932] <list> Others rely on channels, winds, and bindus, spreading in youth to accomplish enlightenment; aging, their power exhausts, and they do not liberate. This path, through self-arising clear light's sun and moon dawning from within, possesses effort—thus aging, old or young, does not exist, which is the razor's pith.
[3933] <list> Others rely on regarding the final fruit as the three bodies. This path, the three bodies dawning as path-appearance, final clear light primordially-pure vastness spontaneously-accomplishing rigpa's definite establishment—this is the pith. || 20 ||
[3934] <prose> Thus, through the greatness of these seven, from Śrāvaka vehicle through the nine progressive stages of outer and inner Secret Mantra, this path surpasses all.
[3935] <ornament> Oh, but if this is also Ati,
[3936] <prose> Does it surpass Ati as well?
[3937] <prose> Regarding Ati also: from the three sections of Mind, Vast Expanse, and Instruction,
[3938] <list> The Mind section establishes confidence in the wide ground-free expanse; rigpa is directly seen. Mind breathes once, self-clear, dwelling thus.
[3939] <list> Unchanging, nine changes dawn as the final aim—thus regarding meaning, direct seeing-not through intellect only.
[3940] <prose> The Instruction section also:
[3941] <list> Outer, inner, and secret circles of three rely on the bardo time.
[3942] <list> This path possesses the pith of liberating as the light-body—thus this surpasses through distinction.
[3943] <prose> Briefly, the piths are inconceivable; though surpassing, names cannot capture them, so elaboration ceases here.
[3944] <prose> Regarding channels and winds: common paths rely on coarse conventional channels and winds, doing body training and so forth with much effort, creating many obstacles and deviations.
[3945] <prose> This path, abandoning the coarse, through three unmoving piths binds only that, not making it the path—
[3946] <prose> Ultimate wisdom's channels and winds, beyond grasping and effort, are made the path, training the body to purity of light. || 30 ||
[3947] <prose> Not relying on common delusion-illusions, obstacle-clearing, and so forth—
[3948] <list> Obstacles are delusion; delusion is suffering.
[3949] <list> That delusion's channels and winds are made the path—elements arising from making delusion the path.
[3950] <prose> This path, making ultimate non-delusion the path, has no obstacles or deviations.
[3951] <prose> Deviations also: those relying on mind-made intellect, not seeing meaning, deviate into paths of equality-duality and forms of experience-realization, making knowing-experience chief—thus not crossing the ridge of deviation-obstacle.
[3952] <prose> This path, directly seen through sense-powers, has no deviation or deviation-place—meaning definitely directly arrived at.
[3953] <prose> Deviating is arising on the path where meaning seeks to go—this path does not have that.
[3954] <prose> Delusion-place does not exist here: not establishing path-measure on raw-ri knowing-experience, instant change-return—
[3955] <prose> For clear light's self-resonance, appearance-experience without deception, is certainty-grasped.
[3956] <prose> Unlike the six applications and so forth:
[3957] <list> Wind-resonance and
[3958] <list> Rigpa-resonance have distinction—jewel-light and
[3959] <list> Lamp-light have distinction. || 40 ||
[3960] <prose> Delusion-appearance, rigpa's impure energy-resonance made the path, does not liberate;
[3961] <prose> Pure appearance, clear light's actual resonance made the path, liberates.
[3962] <prose> These distinctions are illustrated:
[3963] <tantra> From the Definite Explanation:
[3964] <tantra> "In the light of jewel and lamp,
[3965] <tantra> The jewel-mind directly flows;
[3966] <tantra> Although no distinction in wrong knowing,
[3967] <tantra> How great the distinction in meaning-doing!"
[3968] <prose> Thus spoke the Victor.
[3969] <prose> Thus, distinction-great seven with countless small distinctions—superior.
[3970] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[3971] <tantra> "Through the pith of dharmatā directly,
[3972] <tantra> Good and bad in action are not realized;
[3973] <tantra> Through the heart-essence's definite summary,
[3974] <tantra> Sense-powers sharp and dull are not;
[3975] <tantra> Intellect and word's extremes exhausted,
[3976] <tantra> Not wisdom—sense-powers see;
[3977] <tantra> Dharmatā not seen through words,
[3978] <tantra> Common vehicle's meaning not accomplished;
[3979] <tantra> The three bodies path-appearance, || 50 ||
[3980] <tantra> Seeing this, the three realms do not reverse;
[3981] <tantra> All dharmas equal, taste one,
[3982] <tantra> Ground and fruit without reference."
[3983] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[3984] <prose> Second: explaining the path itself possessing distinctions has two aspects:
[3985] <list> The presentation of empowerments that ripen the unripened,
[3986] <list> And the presentation of instructions that liberate the ripened.
[3987] <prose> First: empowerments and their companion samaya—two.
[3988] <prose> Although extensively explained before, here, since the connection is important, summarized:
[3989] <prose> Those persons whose minds have reversed from saṃsāra, free from attachment to this world, desiring to obtain the meaning of Dharma simultaneously—
[3990] <prose> First, to a guru possessing characteristics, empowerment should be completely received.
[3991] <prose> Before that, through elaboration-possessing outer empowerment, relying on maṇḍala and vase,
[3992] <prose> Body-empowerment, the body obtaining power as the yidam's body—
[3993] <prose> Outer container, palace clear,
[3994] <prose> Inner body, deity's body Mahāmudra clear—arise.
[3995] <prose> That is the pith-instruction's key point: freeing the yogin from body, illusion, and bindu.
[3996] <prose> Then, inner elaboration-free empowerment, relying on maṇḍala and vase, empowerment to speech—
[3997] <prose> Speech yidam's recitation clear,
[3998] <prose> Inner inexpressible meaning's experience arising.
[3999] <prose> Relying on the letter A's expression, it arises. || 60 ||
[4000] <prose> Then, secret very-elaboration empowerment, relying on signs and dependent-connection, empowerment to mind—
[4001] <prose> Mind, phenomena's nature, arrives at the top;
[4002] <prose> Mind, clear light's great meaning, experienced.
[4003] <prose> Then, secret supreme: body-posture and
[4004] <prose> Gaze-reliance, empowerment to body, speech, and mind three—
[4005] <prose> Body-posture's pith reliance: liberating into the three bodies' postures;
[4006] <prose> Speech, relying on speaking-ceased, sound's power exhausted,
[4007] <break> <prose> Inexpressible meaning understood;
[4008] <break> <prose> Mind, relying on sign's pith, blessing-energized,
[4009] <prose> Clear light emptiness: what essence is not established—
[4010] <prose> This is aimed at ripening the mantra-path.
[4011] <prose> Thus: body's ripening complete, arising-stage instant clear;
[4012] <prose> Speech's ripening complete, uncommon power arising;
[4013] <prose> Mind's ripening complete, completion-stage's signs and measures arrived at.
[4014] <prose> Body, speech, mind, and sems' ripening complete,
[4015] <prose> Dharmatā-direct path's experience completely perfect.
[4016] <prose> Second: that companion, samaya's sequence—
[4017] <prose> That ripening-complete support, relying on samaya continuum:
[4018] <prose> Generally, samaya's root is root-guru—
[4019] <prose> Through desiring meaning's siddhi,
[4020] <prose> Guru pleased, siddhi arises. || 70 ||
[4021] <tantra> From the Dakinī Net-Thousand Tantra:
[4022] <tantra> "Those desiring siddhi, to the guru
[4023] <tantra> Should worship until the end of time."
[4024] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4025] <prose> That also does not transcend body, speech, and mind three.
[4026] <prose> Body's conduct and so forth, pleasing the guru:
[4027] <list> Preparing the seat,
[4028] <list> Offering maṇḍala,
[4029] <list> Washing service,
[4030] <list> Water-washing,
[4031] <list> Gaze-prostration,
[4032] <list> Sight-prostration, and so forth should be done.
[4033] <prose> Gaze-prostration: when the guru gazes at oneself, prostrating;
[4034] <prose> Sight-prostration: when one sees one's guru.
[4035] <prose> Speech's expression, pleasing the guru:
[4036] <list> Not the guru's faults,
[4037] <list> Focusing on qualities,
[4038] <list> Distinction-words should be expressed.
[4039] <prose> Yidam-knowledge, pleasing:
[4040] <list> Following the guru's activities,
[4041] <list> Guru pleased, intent on others' entry,
[4042] <list> And others, by any means, made to enter with faith in the guru.
[4043] <prose> Guru's speech-utterance expertise:
[4044] <list> Words without excess or lack, able to express to others;
[4045] <list> Guru's heart-intent, as it is, taking into experience—does not transcend this.
[4046] <tantra> From the Great Samaya Tantra:
[4047] <tantra> "As to the guru's action,
[4048] <tantra> With body, speech, and mind pure,
[4049] <tantra> The respectful person to supreme guru
[4050] <tantra> Becomes the vajra-holder."
[4051] <tantra> And also: || 80 ||
[4052] <tantra> "Those possessing faith, desiring siddhi,
[4053] <tantra> From pleasing the guru it arises;
[4054] <tantra> If the guru is not pleased,
[4055] <tantra> Continually wandering saṃsāra's edge."
[4056] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4057] <prose> That also: empowerment time, quality-offering and
[4058] <prose> Feast-doing, and so forth, pleasing the guru;
[4059] <prose> Vajra siblings and
[4060] <prose> Other beings also should be delighted.
[4061] <prose> Thus done, becoming Secret Mantra's samaya,
[4062] <prose> Blessing-entering support becomes special.
[4063] <tantra> "Great compassion, great feast."
[4064] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4065] <prose> Thus, empowerment-received samaya's sequence, as shown before, should be kept.
[4066] <prose> Second: the presentation of instructions that liberate that ripening—two aspects:
[4067] <list> Instruction-general's link-establishment,
[4068] <list> And practice experience-taking.
[4069] <prose> First: all introduction-instruction hitting-manners summarized, three:
[4070] <list> Hitting in the guiding manner,
[4071] <list> Hitting in the introduction manner,
[4072] <list> Hitting completely for the guest-challenge.
[4073] <prose> Within the first, the latter two gather:
[4074] <list> Hitting introduction instantaneously: Direct-Cut, Thögal;
[4075] <list> Hitting completely: bardo instructions.
[4076] <prose> Second: practice experience-taking—
[4077] <list> Preliminaries and
[4078] <list> Actual experience-taking progressive. || 90 ||
[4079] <prose> First has two aspects:
[4080] <ornament> Preliminaries' reasoning;
[4081] <prose> Preliminaries actual.
[4082] <prose> First, three from:
[4083] <prose> Preliminaries: for example, like preparing fear when going a terrifying path before, so the mind goes easily on the path—
[4084] <prose> Making the actual without fear or anxiety.
[4085] <prose> Preliminaries: for example, like a tooth-gap village, ditch-fear guarding done, becoming strong, opportunity not found by whatever—
[4086] <prose> Thus doing the actual, inner mind ease, no hardship—like preliminaries.
[4087] <prose> Preliminaries and actual, two definite;
[4088] <prose> Preliminaries: like good fear-deliverer;
[4089] <prose> Actual: like possessing substance, final arrival.
[4090] <prose> That also: without preliminaries, though actual distinction-pith exists,
[4091] <prose> Like unable to go a terrifying path without deliverer;
[4092] <prose> Without actual-meaning's pith, though preliminary instruction used, fruit does not arise—
[4093] <prose> Thus those two, pair-related, meaning accomplished: like world's farming, male-female pair-union accomplishing.
[4094] <prose> Second: preliminaries actual—
[4095] <list> Who goes before,
[4096] <list> How preliminaries are,
[4097] <list> Example: what like,
[4098] <list> Preliminaries' purpose,
[4099] <list> Supreme distinction: five.
[4100] <prose> First: what goes before? World-transcending preliminaries go before—method aiming at nirvāṇa.
[4101] <prose> That also: three gates' grasping not liberated, not transcending saṃsāra—
[4102] <prose> Body, speech, mind three bound, liberation: definitely exiting existence—supreme transcending preliminaries. || 100 ||
[4103] <prose> Second: how are preliminaries?
[4104] <prose> Before: eons countless, accumulated body, speech, mind's sin liberating—thus called "before."
[4105] <prose> When: before existence-attachment time, body-dwelling, million beings' actions and imprints purifying—thus called "before."
[4106] <prose> Speech's sounds impure purifying—also called "before."
[4107] <prose> Mind-dweller, body-within dwelling, four million insects' mind-movements impure purifying—thus called "before."
[4108] <prose> Goes: actual before, or first, that instruction needing to learn—thus "goes."
[4109] <prose> Before-going, actual-meaning effort-not arising, nirvāṇa-going—thus also called "goes."
[4110] <prose> Third: example—like a merit-possessing king, though urged by others, whatever doing, before not going, powerless to not go;
[4111] <prose> Like a good horse, before going, equipment-adorned, urged, goes—
[4112] <prose> Actual's before-going.
[4113] <prose> Fourth: purpose—
[4114] <prose> Actual trainable easily, arising confidence, without obstacles.
[4115] <prose> Fifth: distinction, three:
[4116] <list> Three bodies' guiding: training in four elements' yoga;
[4117] <list> Rigpa's guiding: training in saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary-dividing conduct;
[4118] <list> Mind's guiding: training in body, speech, mind three's natural-state.
[4119] <prose> First:
[4120] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 110 ||
[4121] <tantra> "The three bodies' training progressive itself,
[4122] <tantra> Arising's quality chiefly making,
[4123] <tantra> Supreme earth, water, fire, wind
[4124] <tantra> Sound-trained, definitely accomplish."
[4125] <prose> Thus the four sounds' yoga-doing progressive spoke.
[4126] <prose> Second: from that itself—
[4127] <tantra> "Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary not divided,
[4128] <tantra> Three realms, body, speech, mind,
[4129] <tantra> Connection cut, not becoming—
[4130] <tantra> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary dividing explained."
[4131] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[4132] <tantra> From the Demonstration Child:
[4133] <tantra> "Thus also, in secret meaning,
[4134] <tantra> Desiring to enter, supreme vessel,
[4135] <break> <tantra> Before, body, speech, mind's
[4136] <break> <tantra> Manifest grasping, reversing for,
[4137] <tantra> Before, conduct should begin."
[4138] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[4139] <tantra> From the Lamp Blaze:
[4140] <tantra> "Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary divided,
[4141] <tantra> Body, speech settled."
[4142] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4143] <prose> This: three from—
[4144] <prose> First, training in the four elements' yoga that guides the three bodies.
[4145] <prose> From the Thalgyur: "The progressive training of the three bodies itself,
[4146] <prose> Making chief the arising's qualities,
[4147] <prose> Supreme earth, water, fire, wind—
[4148] <prose> Trained in sound, definitely accomplish."
[4149] <prose> Thus spoke the manner of doing yoga with the four sounds.
[4150] <prose> Second: from that itself—
[4151] <prose> "If saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's boundary is not divided,
[4152] <prose> The three realms with body, speech, and mind
[4153] <prose> Connection not cut, not becoming—
[4154] <prose> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary dividing is explained."
[4155] <prose> Thus it is said. || 120 ||
