[13695] <prose> First, when awareness enters the light by looking outward at self-appearance, resting in the state of knowing appearances as self-appearance,
[13696] <prose> When those appearances dissolve like light rays into one's own heart center, this is called entering awareness into light.
[13697] <prose> Through recognizing one's own face as the self-place of primordial purity, ground is obtained in that very state and directly penetrated—
[13698] <prose> Therefore no appearances exist thereafter.
[13699] <prose> Awareness is one's own nature,
[13700] <prose> While light shines upon those outer self-appearances.
