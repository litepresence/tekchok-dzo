[16025] <prose> From the aspect of purified karma-wind and wisdom-wind,
[16026] <break> <prose> The distant-snare,
[16027] <prose> The part,
[16028] <prose> Through wisdom-wind the elements are distantly snared.
[16029] <prose> Virtue.
[16030] <break> <prose> Thus four arise from this.
[16031] <prose> Mountains, houses, and other great things appear as small supports.
[16032] <prose> From the subtle and detailed part of wind they arise.
[16033] <prose> That is the actual distant-snare.
[16034] <prose> The light-root, pure wisdom-appearance, is held. || 10 ||
[16035] <prose> By seeing the appearance of that support's delusion-appearance,
[16036] <prose> There is support and supported.
[16037] <prose> When the wise possessing the two parts examine this, they should realize it.
[16038] <prose> These are the four lamps.
[16039] <prose> Samsara's delusion-appearance and delusion-mind are different.
[16040] <prose> This is the cause for holding the transcended part.
[16041] <prose> This essential point is of great importance.
[16042] <prose> Henceforth, should these two differences be known and appear, understand this. It is my essential point.
[16043] <prose> The lamp of empty bindu:
[16044] <prose> The round bindu possessing the rim of five lights arises from the part of purified karma-wind. || 20 ||
[16045] <prose> From that, the lamp of self-arising wisdom
[16046] <prose> And the lamp of completely pure space arise.
[16047] <prose> To wisdom: essence,
[16048] <prose> Potential,
[16049] <prose> And tone the three.
[16050] <prose> Essence is:
[16051] <prose> At the time of applying the lamp of empty bindu through the essential points of the distant-snare gaze posture. That which is experienced as pure self-clarity of inner awareness.
[16052] <prose> From potential: outwardly clear, the wisdom of knowing objects, sharp and swift;
[16053] <prose> Words and meanings arising as an expanse.
[16054] <prose> Tone is like a golden cord hanging of vajra-chain appearance. || 30 ||
[16055] <prose> If these are not distinguished,
[16056] <prose> Sometimes knowledge is labeled as the lamp of self-arising wisdom,
[16057] <prose> Sometimes the inner tone is labeled,
[16058] <prose> Sometimes the chain is labeled merely confused.
[16059] <prose> Regarding the lamp of space: from outer and inner, 
[16060] <prose> Outer: in the center of the pure sky, a blue-green light-tone first appears somewhat.
[16061] <prose> Inner: arising like an expansion from that,
[16062] <prose> The radiance of five lights clear as five colors.
[16063] <prose> That also:
[16064] <prose> Space is outer and inner. 
[16065] <prose> Outer is held in the cloud-free sky.
[16066] <prose> Inner: to the pure lamp of space.
[16067] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[16068] <prose> Moreover, regarding this, some identify that outer sky as merely cloudless very improper, 
[16069] <prose> For that sky and person have no established connection.
[16070] <prose> The lamp follows the cause of doing existence and non-existence of person.
[16071] <prose> Here, that blue tone of inner space arising outward is called outer space.
[16072] <prose> By that, space is merely the ground of the basis of open sky, not actual space.
[16073] <prose> Actual is dark-blue.
[16074] <prose> Space is inner of inner space. || 50 ||
[16075] <prose> Thus, space from which appearance arises appearing, these two are called outer space and inner space separately; though the load of rainbow-light is unclear in the house, understand it as merely clear transfer.
[16076] <prose> Not like making inner near and outer far,
[16077] <prose> Know as outer and inner that which arises appearing from that.
[16078] <prose> Also clear as five lights: mind's self-nature's clear light self-tone arising. 
[16079] <prose> That itself: stain of thing, stain of intellectual wisdom,
[16080] <prose> Completely pure by the stain of bad-concept mind.
[16081] <prose> Lamp:
[16082] <prose> At the time of seeing that appearance,
[16083] <prose> From the part of clearing the darkness of karma and habitual tendencies it is said.
[16084] <prose> Regarding that: the first of four lamps gathered as essence from four chakras. 
[16085] <prose> First, the producer: by wind propelling upward to upward into the mother's womb, called distant showing entering the center of mother from afar through cause and condition of the mother's womb,
[16086] <prose> Mindfulness, wind-mind, cause, condition, and four gathered as one,
[16087] <prose> Binding, — therefore called snare.
[16088] <prose> In tastes, bliss of six tastes increases, and the eye of essence expands therefore called water. 
[16089] <prose> At the tip: distinctions of action of five senses and distinctions of five wisdoms directly realized, and directly arising to the object of reality sense therefore called lamp, cause of clearing samsara's darkness.
[16090] <prose> From the lamp of empty bindu:
[16091] <prose> Comparing with relative causal bindu,
[16092] <prose> Bindu is essence lowered by posture.
[16093] <break> <prose> Le: HUM of speech, etc., holding secret and identifying wisdom. 
[16094] <break> <prose> Empty: reversing bindu, bestowing potential, mixing with wind, meditating bliss as empty action of mind. 
[16095] <prose> Lamp: by that meaning clearing darkness.
[16096] <prose> Comparing with ultimate wisdom bindu: bindu is three gaze posture, awareness of gaze posture, and self-essence not changing.
[16097] <prose> Le is:
[16098] <prose> Appearance arising round as rim of light.
[16099] <prose> Empty is: 
[16100] <prose> That appearance not established as thing and characteristic, no harm from four elements.
[16101] <prose> Self-appearance, — therefore shown; not seen by other.
[16102] <prose> Clear light: free from elaboration extreme, clearing darkness of ignorance.
[16103] <prose> Lamp:
[16104] <prose> Clearing samsara's darkness. 
[16105] <prose> From the lamp of self-arising knowledge:
[16106] <prose> Comparing with time of realizing essence,
[16107] <prose> Wind dwelling in nadi's essential point is main therefore called knowledge.
[16108] <prose> Number of wind's propel-withdrawal essential point is main therefore called excellent.
[16109] <prose> Arising from reality and dwelling in reality, 
[16110] <prose> Arising at occasion free in excellent three moments therefore called self-arising.
[16111] <prose> Wind exhausted and free in space therefore called lamp.
[16112] <prose> Comparing with appearance clear light,
[16113] <prose> Inner wisdom by self-tone self-aware arising to sense object therefore called knowledge.
[16114] <prose> Arising-appearance, chain, bindu, bindu-particle together with that all delusion-appearance exhausted to sense-field, most transcendent therefore called excellent. 
[16115] <prose> Inside this: exhausted letters,
[16116] <prose> Hand-symbols,
[16117] <prose> Form, etc. appearing,
[16118] <prose> Earth, etc. ten exhausted, actually appearing,
[16119] <prose> Not able to appear to sense together with delusion therefore called wisdom of exhaustion.
[16120] <prose> That appearance and at that time reasoning basis appearing, wisdom together with other not arising, arising from self therefore called self.
[16121] <prose> Arising is that and connection established.
[16122] <prose> Cause of self-appearance arising from awareness.
[16123] <prose> Lamp:
[16124] <prose> Darkness of mind and mental-events from mind that word is said. 
[16125] <prose> The lamp of completely pure space arises from directly seeing the essential point.
[16126] <prose> That also: basis of arising of five lights therefore called space.
[16127] <prose> At time of appearance arising as light, pure together with element impurity therefore called completely pure.
[16128] <prose> By seeing that, transforming impure-together light body, clearing samsara's darkness therefore called lamp. 
[16129] <prose> Comparing with sequential experience-application,
[16130] <prose> Before, purifying the basis of body, speech, and mind three therefore called space.
[16131] <prose> First, if body's essential point not pressed, wisdom not gathered under power.
[16132] <prose> If speech's essential point not pressed, inexpressible meaning not obtained.
[16133] <prose> If mind's essential point not pressed, movement self-continuum not cut,
[16134] <prose> If pressed, these are accomplished. 
[16135] <prose> Great main path of directly self-seen therefore called completely.
[16136] <prose> By essential point of door seeing space, cause of delusion-appearance ceasing therefore called pure.
[16137] <prose> That also: by essential point of arise-produce door seeing reality's space, arriving at certainty.
[16138] <prose> By essential point of appearance object, whatever appears, no grasping-place from reality.
[16139] <break> <prose> By essential point of vital-point bestowing wind, different conceptual thoughts cease. 
[16140] <prose> By essential point of arise-produce clear light, subtle and coarse elements reverse.
[16141] <break> <prose> By essential point of seeing reality's direct appearance, sequence of view-meditation-conduct-result meeting reality's meaning through intellectual words cut.
[16142] <break> <prose> By seeing appearance of experience progress increase, not-pure delusion-appearance material-awareness self-ceases.
[16143] <break> <prose> By seeing appearance of awareness measure arrived, enjoying the two form-bodies.
[16144] <prose> By seeing appearance of reality exhausted, free from bind of three-kayas' self-continuum. 
[16145] <prose> Thus making result as path, transcending all vehicles making effort-accomplish cause-result from the start.
[16146] <prose> Lamp is like a wall lamp, showing instructions of four final supports as branch of essential point of taking in experience.
[16147] <prose> That also: having three not-changing as basis, conceptual thought increase exhausted, and no go-place from reality and self-appearance.
[16148] <prose> Holding all three dwellings in measure, understanding body, speech, and mind not returning to three realms.
[16149] <prose> Hitting vital-point of three obtains, cutting connection cord of four wind-minds' cause-condition, hereafter those four not meeting together possible.
[16150] <prose> Grasping measure of four confidences free, no hope-doubt for samsara-nirvana, gone to certainty object of reality's space. 
[16151] <prose> Thus, if four lamps not, samsara-nirvana's connection not cut,
[16152] <prose> Body, speech, mind, and mind four always wandering samsara from four lamps existing, understand, decide, take in experience, obtain liberation's enlightenment.
[16153] <prose> That also: by four lamps existing,
[16154] <prose> From four empowerments ripening the basis, purifying self-continuum.
[16155] <prose> Arriving at measure of four path-appearances, dissolving four-kayas in space arising from that essential point. 
[16156] <prose> That also: self-arising lamp in the precious jar of meaning, heart, precious heart's jar, dwelling like sky.
[16157] <prose> Middle: connection-cord of mouth's sky like four lamps joining interval.
[16158] <prose> Outer: great sky like mother-son uniting in free-place of primordially pure space.
[16159] <prose> Arrived at measure or bardo self-clear reality arising, impure-together body-jar breaking.
[16160] <prose> Penetrating spontaneously accomplished precious secret cavity arising from taking four lamps' reality in experience. 
[16161] <prose> Here also: summarizing, explaining enumeration of four lamps,
[16162] <prose> Four lamps gathered to ultimate element,
[16163] <prose> Ripening to distant-snare.
[16164] <prose> Seeing form aspect from far distance therefore called distant. 
[16165] <prose> That itself arising from element wind, making movement without hindrance.
[16166] <prose> Holding form of far distance therefore called snare.
[16167] <prose> Engaging color, shape, etc., part of water element called water.
[16168] <prose> Expanding to objects of sense, family, enjoyment, etc., similar cause to fire therefore called lamp.
[16169] <prose> Bindu: || 140 ||
[16170] <prose> Wisdom of basis-dwelling.
[16171] <prose> That itself directly appearing, dwelling as primordially pure wisdom, nature spontaneously accomplished, elaboration-free, beyond direction-side,
[16172] <prose> Dwelling as all-pervading wisdom, basis of not-changing.
[16173] <prose> Empty:
[16174] <prose> Appearing as wisdom of characteristic-holding, dharma of thing holding in self-continuum also empty. 
[16175] <prose> Arise-basis of emptiness clear light clear as mirror-like wisdom,
[16176] <prose> Direction, side, center, limit not observable by emptiness, dwelling as wisdom of non-diminished self,
[16177] <prose> In nature of emptiness not possessing direction-side, all different intellect thoughts cease, individually discriminating wisdom not ceasing,
[16178] <prose> Free as wisdom of action accomplishing from beyond effort of empty,
[16179] <prose> By not moving from one mandala of emptiness, gathering wisdom of dharma's space,
[16180] <prose> Called wisdom free from elaboration. 
[16181] <prose> Lamp:
[16182] <prose> Wisdom gathered by knowledge.
[16183] <prose> That also: wisdom gathered by worldly knowledge, free from extreme-limit of reality not possessing abandonment,
[16184] <prose> And knowledge's wisdom gathered by transcendence, not needing to abandon anything on basis, not possessing establishment from the start of correct reality.
[16185] <prose> And wisdom gathered by knowables, seeing root of not-fabricated free, 
[16186] <prose> And wisdom gathered by view, directly seeing clear light sense,
[16187] <prose> And wisdoms gathered by omniscience, seeing object and aspect, how and how-many.

[16190] <list> Mindfulness,
[16191] <list> Thought,
[16192] <list> And contemplations.

[16230] <prose> From various cause-conditions of latent tendencies and many actions, thus labeled. 
[16231] <prose> Some: saying one is enough, calling mind.
[16232] <prose> If thinking division by many improper,
[16233] <prose> One gathered as mental-events is enough.
[16234] <prose> Equal to saying division into fifty-one improper.
[16235] <prose> Then division-gathering however much, depending on parts, no contradiction. 
[16236] <prose> The lamp of completely pure space:
[16237] <prose> Gathering of light and form's arise-produce.
[16238] <prose> That also: five colors gathered, pervading dark-blue, not changing, all-around surrounded by vajra fence, no grasping-place to vajra chain.
[16239] <prose> Inside that: light-form light-rays emanating appearing.
[16240] <prose> Cutting this reality's bardo, actually perfect Buddha. 
[16241] <prose> By appearance of light upward-standing, side-arising, and rim-appearing, delusion-appearance self-ceases, clear as wisdom.
[16242] <prose> From those: light's layer piece,

[16254] <prose> That also: four lamps determining measure-sign of four path-appearances. 
[16255] <break> <prose> By distant-snare seeing reality's direct appearance, intelligence reverses from holding self-asserter philosophical position.
[16256] <prose> By empty bindu seeing experience top-increase, mind turns from appearance of holding bliss in own-continuum.
[16257] <prose> By completely pure sphere seeing awareness measure-reached, mind turns from impure delusion-appearance.
