[4916] <prose> First, regarding the direct perception of Dharmatā: as experience increases, awareness arrives at its measure, and the vision exhausting Dharmatā is extensively explained.
[4917] <prose> Two aspects: the general place of direct connection, and identifying self-characteristics.
[4918] <prose> First, general direct perception—conventionally termed the famous direct, and ultimately the direct meeting the dhātu—two divisions.
[4919] <prose> First: sense-power direct perception—form and so forth, five objects, the nature of vision; and mind direct perception—enjoyment of near objects, certain cause, conceptuality's object within vision; and self-awareness direct perception—within pleasure, pain, and so forth, experience called vision; and the yogin's direct perception itself—near meeting with meaning, entering the actual point, particular correct awareness and that object of vision in a non-dual state, the certainty of experience free from grasping and holding. || 10 ||
[4920] <tantra> From Clear-Meaning:
[4921] <verse> Gathering mind from all,
[4922] <verse> Inner self unmoving,
[4923] <verse> Though abiding, eye forms—
[4924] <verse> Seeing mind is sense-born.
[4925] <verse> Thus explained, like so.
[4926] <prose> Ultimate direct perception meeting the dhātu—determining that the essence of awareness, Dharmatā, exists in the heart;
[4927] <prose> That self-resonance, from the heart connecting cause to the eye, like sun and light-ray, certain cause and effect, meeting with faith through reasoning.
[4928] <prose> That reason: from the two, worldly and transcendent, this is the transcendent direct perception.
[4929] <prose> Transcendent: the chief mind knowing objects, certain cause of mind, || 20 ||
[4930] <prose> And the chief seeing the seal of main-point, awareness direct perception—from these two,
[4931] <prose> This is called awareness direct perception.
[4932] <prose> Second: identifying self-characteristics, called the direct vision of Dharmatā.
[4933] <prose> Applying the word Dharmatā in proximity, four divisions:
[4934] <list> —Saṃsāra dharmas,
[4935] <list> Called this Dharmatā, Nirvāṇa Dharmatā;
[4936] <list> —Vision dharmas,
[4937] <list> Called this Dharmatā as empty; || 30 ||
[4938] <list> —Dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
[4939] <list> Famous as Dharmatā, this Dharmatā certainly liberating through existence;
[4940] <list> —Dhātu dharmas,
[4941] <list> Famous as awareness Dharmatā, desiring both as non-dual.
[4942] <prose> Direct perception: actually seeing existence in the activity field of sense-power; that also: not relying upon intellect—
[4943] <prose> Intellect's wisdom, whatever is sought, time not existing to find;
[4944] <prose> The seeker possesses no eye,
[4945] <prose> The cause possesses no luminous-clear form. || 40 ||
[4946] <tantra> From Collection:
[4947] <verse> Investigate with wisdom, aggregates' bottom not found.
[4948] <verse> Thus it was said.
[4949] <prose> This luminous-clear vision, famous as a term, not possessing form—subtle particles and coarse entities, this self-characteristic not existing as cause, the four elements' harm, destroy, crush not possible as cause;
[4950] <prose> Possessing form: possible to destroy and crush existing, that cause is form's characteristic.
[4951] <prose> Three enumerations: outer body, speech, and mind three, establishing base with three main-points.
[4952] <list> —Inner: the main-point of Dharmatā field;
[4953] <list> —Dawning cause: the main-point of gate;
[4954] <list> —Wind abiding: three main-points clearing the path,
[4955] <list> —Secret: sequence of habituation's measure, || 50 ||
[4956] <list> —Ripening: sequence of signs,
[4957] <list> —Ultimate end: sequence of exhaustion,
[4958] <list> And taking measure with three,
[4959] <prose> Supreme vision.
[4960] <prose> Ripening: point; completion: body and three fruits completing cause;
[4961] <prose> Three group: four determinations, — therefore called three.
[4962] <prose> Or: Dharmatā's three-bodies spontaneously complete existing, three self-resonance visions, outer dawning number;
[4963] <list> —Dharmakāya self-resonance: inner experience of awareness-emptiness;
[4964] <list> —Saṃbhogakāya self-resonance: outer clarity of five lights, wisdom self-clear;
[4965] <list> —Nirmāṇakāya self-resonance: dawning liberation, equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three, || 60 ||
[4966] <prose> Therefore called three, relying thus.
[4967] <prose> That also: base three establishing base, main-point of entity without existing difference,
[4968] <prose> And path three clearing obstacles, path without existing near or far,
[4969] <prose> And measure three delivering to measure, without existing similar, different, or random,
[4970] <prose> And fruit three delivering to exhaustion's end, without existing yes-no doubt,
[4971] <prose> Therefore called direct perception.
[4972] <prose> Ordinary time: seeing three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity, three dawning—pleasure, pain, middle;
[4973] <prose> Time of taking guru's instruction as experience: direct seeing three—dhātu, awareness, dharmas. || 70 ||
[4974] <prose> Dharmatā direct perception: main-point without existing intellect's word additions;
[4975] <prose> Time of habituation: main-point of self-ceasing delusion vision, seeing three-bodies' light point;
[4976] <prose> Time of arriving at measure: direct seeing three—clear, empty, pleasure; main-point: Dharmatā's self-exhaustion.
[4977] <prose> Thus: three enumeration place, relying upon other, fruit determined as simultaneously liberating.
[4978] <prose> Vision: whatever dawns, Dharmatā dawns; field: whatever dawns, dhātu dawns; manner: whatever dawns, light, light-house, and awareness hanging-cord dawn.
[4979] <prose> Buddha: with stone not-seeing, fruit: taking that vision as experience.
[4980] <prose> Thus: essence of Dharmatā direct perception vision—dhātu awareness luminous-clear vision.
[4981] <tantra> From Letterless:
[4982] <verse> Direct perception: Buddhas without birth, || 80 ||
[4983] <verse> See vision pure without field.
[4984] <verse> Thus said, and:
[4985] <tantra> From Illusion:
[4986] <verse> Jewel, wish-fulfilling, desire-glory—
[4987] <verse> All Buddhas' direct perception.
[4988] <verse> Thus it was said.
[4989] <prose> Definitive-meaning: seeing three-bodies' vision.
[4990] <tantra> From Jewel Heap Tantra:
[4991] <verse> Direct perception called seeing;
[4992] <verse> Three called three-bodies; || 90 ||
[4993] <verse> Certain arrival at field realm.
[4994] <verse> Thus it was said.
[4995] <prose> Purpose: liberating without error or obscuration, this main-point.
[4996] <tantra> That same, from:
[4997] <verse> Dharmatā direct perception without main-point—
[4998] <verse> Similar to going to precipice without eye.
[4999] <verse> Thus it was said.
[5000] <prose> Main-point from Thalgyur:
[5001] <verse> Main-point: arrow not moving;
[5002] <verse> Apply three gaze manners this time. || 100 ||
[5003] <verse> Thus said, and:
[5004] <tantra> From Letterless:
[5005] <verse> Make fully place eye;
[5006] <verse> Dhātu emerges from eye corner itself;
[5007] <verse> Gaze eye at sky element.
[5008] <verse> Thus it was said.
[5009] <prose> Vision is:
[5010] <break> <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[5011] <break> <verse> Dharmatā direct perception is;
[5012] <verse> Certain emergence from sense-power gate; || 110 ||
[5013] <verse> Clear in sky without clouds.
[5014] <verse> Thus said, and:
[5015] <verse> Also channel and delusion-wheel:
[5016] <verse> Five wisdoms abide in nature,
[5017] <verse> See bubble by eye.
[5018] <verse> Thus said, and:
[5019] <tantra> From Self-Dawn:
[5020] <verse> Body of light possessing five wisdoms, || 120 ||
[5021] <verse> Fully clear in hanging-cord,
[5022] <verse> That also: go and come,
[5023] <verse> Move and shake.
[5024] <verse> Thus said, and:
[5025] <tantra> From Lion Power Complete:
[5026] <verse> That entity of self-vision awareness
[5027] <verse> Abides in wisdom hanging-cord.
[5028] <verse> Thus said, and:
[5029] <tantra> From Jewel Display:
[5030] <verse> Said: arrow, water lamp—fully perfect Buddha,
[5031] <verse> Awareness hanging-cord body fully clear.
[5032] <prose> Manner of taking experience: first, short sessions in great number;
[5033] <prose> Second, extend session, extend duration; third, without day or night, take experience,
[5034] <prose> Make not move, place awareness in dhātu fence.
