[3145] <prose> Mastering deluded-appearance truthless illusion-nature.
[3146] <prose> Seeing own body also as illusion-body, without doubt holding bardo illusory-body.
[3147] <prose> As said in the Ljonpa-asked Sutra:

[3149] <prose> Like face-reflection appearing.
[3150] <prose> How nature not established.

[3187] <prose> Seeing body also as transparent, shadow-form-like appearance, truth-not-exist.
[3188] <prose> Shadow not exist upon body, and.
[3189] <prose> Holding bardo illusory-body, becoming final-existence person.
[3190] <prose> Like holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton and scholar Nyibum.
[3191] <prose> Those also from Thalgyur:
[3192] <prose> Train illusory-body dream.
[3193] <prose> By that mastery, body itself also. || 70 ||
[3194] <prose> Become like shadow-form.
[3195] <prose> By that intermediate body.
[3196] <prose> These become self-held.
[3197] <prose> Thus it is.
