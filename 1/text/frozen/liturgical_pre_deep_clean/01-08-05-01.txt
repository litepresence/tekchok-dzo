[10757] <ornament> First: Because unceasing display of recognition exists as depth-clarity within the essence of primordial purity, the characteristic of awareness of primordial purity in the portion of non-duality is not established as thing or mark,
[10758] <prose> The natural expression of self-abiding rigpa, clarity of subtle inner recognition, dwells.
[10759] <prose> The essence of appearance is empty, the nature of emptiness dwells clear—the heart of awareness is form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, resting like the heart of the sun.
[10760] <prose> The essence being primordially pure and the nature being spontaneously recognized are held to be non-dual.
[10761] <tantra> From the Rangshar:
[10762] <tantra> "The basis is spoken of as having two aspects:
[10763] <tantra> The basis of great primordial purity, and
[10764] <tantra> The basis of variegated unceasing display."
[10765] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[10766] <tantra> From the Klong drug pa: || 10 ||
[10767] <tantra> "The essence itself is primordially pure;
[10768] <tantra> The nature is spontaneously accomplished."
[10769] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[10770] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[10771] <tantra> "The essence is primordially pure, free from the basis of expression;
[10772] <tantra> The nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."
[10773] <tantra> Thus it is.
[10774] <ornament> Second: Abandoning disputes regarding this recognition has two parts: conceptual enumeration and direct recognition of one's own face.
