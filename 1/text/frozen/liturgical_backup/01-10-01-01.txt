[12500] <prose> The Vajra Essence Path reveals the primordial nature wherein existence itself arises as spontaneous presence beyond conceptual elaboration.
[12501] <prose> The forms of sentient beings emerge as inconceivable manifestations beyond the reach of ordinary conceptual mind.
[12502] <prose> The path of delusion and intention arises according to the manner in which conceptual thought manifests its own nature.
[12503] <prose> Vajrasattva represents the pure awareness of Rigpa, the self-arising wisdom of Dharmatā.
[12504] <prose> The vast expanse represents the ground of being wherein all phenomena naturally abide.
[12505] <prose> The primordial fourfold nature abides as the basis of all manifestation.
[12506] <prose> The magnificent abode manifests as the gateway of spontaneous presence.
[12507] <prose> The ground appearance arises effortlessly as the natural display of clear light.
[12508] <prose> The timeless moment when sound emerged represents the beginningless Dharmatā of Samantabhadra.
[12509] <prose> When self appears as other through non-recognition, the ground of delusion manifests as apparent existence. || 10 ||
[12510] <prose> The year of the Pig marks the time when non-recognition was fully established as conceptual imputation.
[12511] <prose> The emanated sun represents the clear perception of coarse object appearances arising as Nirmāṇakāya.
[12512] <prose> The Bird constellation represents desire that arose as attachment to objects of the five senses.
[12513] <prose> The old woman represents the emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded apprehension of self.
[12514] <prose> The uncertain lineage represents how ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion without distinction.
[12515] <prose> The four rugged ones represent the four conditions that give rise to all experience.
[12516] <prose> The five wild ones represent the five poisons that obscure the natural state.
[12517] <prose> The single back support represents the conceptualizing mind that grasps at duality.
[12518] <prose> The single thief represents anger that steals the peace of natural awareness.
[12519] <prose> The single gatherer represents how deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. || 20 ||
[12520] <prose> This mind becomes the apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence.
[12521] <prose> From this arise the manifold afflictions as the hosts of maras that obscure realization.
[12522] <prose> Thus delusion arose from the primordial purity without ground or basis, hence called existence.
[12523] <ornament> The second section reveals delusion and liberation through the profound metaphors of the Vajra Essence.
[12524] <prose> From spontaneous presence comes the teaching that all pure appearances should be understood through these symbols.
[12525] <prose> In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion, manifestation of self-arising wisdom.
[12526] <prose> He had two sons who were imprisoned in a cave, thus the story of delusion begins.
[12527] <prose> Then five soldiers came and conquered from the stone fortress peak, representing the five poisons.
[12528] <prose> The two sons were sent into the valley and the old woman with the mushroom hat blocked the gate of liberation.
[12529] <prose> Then four men captured them and separated the five men from their horses, representing the four wisdoms. || 30 ||
[12530] <prose> The two sons escaped by themselves and killed the prison guards, representing self-liberation.
[12531] <prose> The two sons fled to a place of sun and rain, gathered subjects, and consulted with twenty-one queens of wisdom.
[12532] <prose> They fled to the temple of Fierce Thought where five men wearing five hats guarded the gate.
[12533] <prose> No one could enter without recognition, thus the story continues.
[12534] <prose> Then four mirrors looked at the demon and recognized their own nature as Dharmakāya.
[12535] <prose> Then seeing a house with eight doors, they laughed and lost themselves in spontaneous presence.
[12536] <prose> These metaphorical forms point to the meaning of primordial wisdom manifesting as Saṃbhogakāya.
[12537] <prose> The Teacher Light Diffusion represents self-arising wisdom, the Buddha nature within all beings.
[12538] <break> <prose> The two sons represent the wisdom of primordial purity and spontaneous presence united.
[12539] <break> <prose> Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom and is bound by non-recognition. || 40 ||
[12540] <prose> The five men conquering from the stone fortress represents how the five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding nature.
[12541] <prose> The two sons blocked by the old woman represents Rigpa entering the valley of existence, blocked by non-recognition.
[12542] <prose> Being captured by four men and separating five from horses represents how the four wisdoms purify the five afflictions.
[12543] <prose> The four wisdoms liberate afflictions, gather wisdom, distinguish between afflictions and wisdom, and move to the expanse.
[12544] <prose> The two sons escaping and killing guards represents recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual bonds.
[12545] <prose> The two sons fleeing to sun and rain and gathering subjects represents Rigpa entering the eyes and beholding the expanse.
[12546] <prose> The queens consulting and fleeing to the temple represents the twenty-one instructions manifesting inner meaning.
[12547] <prose> The five men guarding with hats represents the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought.
[12548] <prose> The four mirrors looking at the demon represents the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa.
[12549] <prose> Seeing the house with eight doors represents recognizing spontaneous presence and establishing the ground. || 50 ||
[12550] <ornament> The third section presents another teaching from the same source of spontaneous presence.
[12551] <prose> In the Land of Great Circumference dwelt a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and mind.
[12552] <prose> The Land of Radiant Light was seen by the Teacher Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness.
[12553] <prose> Listen, Radiant Being, and I shall prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.
[12554] <prose> Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the Ocean with Rim, where Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell.
[12555] <prose> From their union came two children, brother and sister, representing wisdom and means.
[12556] <prose> Then the parents spoke thus to the children, giving instructions for the path.
[12557] <prose> Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition.
[12558] <prose> Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit.
[12559] <prose> The son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in non-recognition. || 60 ||
[12560] <prose> Again the parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation.
[12561] <prose> The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is your aunt, the coemergent ignorance.
[12562] <prose> Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition.
[12563] <prose> The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding.
[12564] <prose> Noble parents, that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings.
[12565] <prose> Send five servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light.
[12566] <prose> Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families, thus he requested.
[12567] <prose> The parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports.
[12568] <prose> Then the son spoke again, asking for further guidance.
[12569] <prose> Noble parents, if I am captured in the demon land, what method shall I use? || 70 ||
[12570] <prose> The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps.
[12571] <prose> Send them as troops, one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method.
[12572] <prose> Two to block the gate of delusion, thus they gave the complete instructions.
[12573] <prose> Thus prophesied by the parents, the son said he would do so with confidence.
[12574] <verse> Saying E Ma Ho, he departed, and the demon Black Halika saw him approaching.
[12575] <verse> Oh, a flesh-eating human has appeared, do not let him escape, said the attendants of affliction.
[12576] <prose> The five demons captured him, and Aunt Mushroom Hat put him in iron chains of grasping.
[12577] <prose> She told the attendants that he killed her son, so do not release him from bondage.
[12578] <prose> The attendants agreed, and thus he had no power to escape without wisdom.
[12579] <prose> Then the boy spoke thus, using skillful means. || 80 ||
[12580] <prose> Noble aunt, my parents said that Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells in the demon land of non-recognition.
[12581] <prose> They told me to come to the mirror, so release me without capture for I am your relative.
[12582] <prose> The old woman replied that she would not release him because he killed her son of delusion.
[12583] <prose> Then the boy spoke again, threatening to use force.
[12584] <prose> If you do not release me, I shall summon troops of wisdom to conquer.
[12585] <prose> You yourself summon troops, she replied arrogantly, and thus he could not escape alone.
[12586] <prose> Then the boy sent messages to three friends representing the three baskets of teachings.
[12587] <prose> Friends, in the Jewel Heap Land of mind dwell four people of the caste, the four lamps.
[12588] <prose> Go there, for the boy Rig Knowledge has been captured, bring many troops of wisdom.
[12589] <prose> They agreed and went swiftly to assist their friend. || 90 ||
[12590] <prose> Then within three days at sunrise, many troops came and blocked the gate of delusion.
[12591] <prose> The prisoner's irons were broken, the old woman of non-recognition was expelled.
[12592] <prose> The five were separated from their horses, and Aunt's son was captured.
[12593] <prose> The attendants were beheaded with swords of wisdom and killed, liberating all.
[12594] <prose> Then he fled to his own land and met his sister coming with many flowers of virtue.
[12595] <prose> The parents recognized them and rejoiced greatly, naming the brother Vajra Chain Puller.
[12596] <prose> The sister was named Rim Holder, representing the bindu of clear light.
[12597] <prose> Then the siblings consulted and saw the Teacher Mirror Possessor, Buddha Samantabhadra.
[12598] <prose> Listen, noble child, in the Uncontrived Appearance Land dwells a crystal stupa of Dharmakāya.
[12599] <prose> Upon its wheel are four silver mirrors of the four lamps, so go from Malaya's peak. || 100 ||
[12600] <prose> Put it in the rim enclosure, climb the jewel stairs carrying a jewel vessel of wisdom.
[12601] <break> <verse> At the stupa's peak dwells a teacher Unchanging Light, the Dharmakāya Buddha.
[12602] <verse> From his right foot comes a light-ray rope of compassion, so hold it without fear and go.
[12603] <break> <prose> Then your appearance's father is there, so run there with devotion.
[12604] <prose> Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors, where your mother Various Appearance dwells.
[12605] <prose> At that time you will not recognize your mother due to habitual patterns.
[12606] <prose> Beyond that is a house of various jewels, your true abode, so take your seat there.
[12607] <prose> Thus prophesied by the Teacher, the boy Chain Puller spoke thus with gratitude.
[12608] <prose> Great Teacher, we shall do so, he said to his sister with determination.
[12609] <break> <prose> We shall do as the Teacher prophesied, following the path of liberation. || 110 ||
[12610] <break> <verse> Riding the sun's rays of wisdom, wearing rainbow armor of the elements.
[12611] <verse> With a pearl garland binding the waist of channels, holding a crystal spear of awareness.
[12612] <prose> A path appeared in space and they reached the jewel house without obstruction.

[12626] <break> <prose> The single mirror represents the experience of object investigation revealing emptiness.
[12627] <prose> The five with sword and mirrors represents how appearance is not Rigpa's object.
[12628] <prose> Lost in delusion, Rigpa wanders there, needing the five wisdoms as companions.
[12629] <prose> The son asking the method represents seeking liberation from delusion through inquiry. || 130 ||
[12630] <prose> The Jewel Heap Land is the mind, the four people are the four lamps.
[12631] <prose> Sending troops represents practice companions, gathering with wisdom, distinguishing mind and wisdom.
[12632] <prose> The four wisdoms liberate, distinguish, gather, and move to the expanse.

[12660] <prose> A path arises in space, liberating in primordial purity's ground of Dharmakāya.
[12661] <ornament> The fourth section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence.
[12662] <prose> In the Pure Appearance Land dwells a fortress with eight doors of liberation.
[12663] <prose> The boy Self-Arising Rigpa Knowledge rules there as the natural state.
[12664] <prose> An old woman Mushroom Hat dwells there, and the king Arrow Guard Fame Power.
[12665] <break> <prose> He has five princely sons who went to play, capturing the old woman of ignorance.
[12666] <break> <prose> Then the boy went to the daughter's playground, captured and put in chains.

[12668] <prose> The Pure Appearance Land represents Rigpa's pure realm of Dharmakāya.
[12669] <prose> The eight-door fortress represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of liberation. || 170 ||
[12670] <prose> Self-arising Rigpa dwells with coemergent non-recognition as the old woman.
[12671] <prose> The king represents the root of afflictions, self-grasping at true existence.
[12672] <prose> The sons represent the five poison afflictions that disturb the mind.
[12673] <prose> Play represents mastery over the five senses while experiencing attachment and aversion.
[12674] <prose> Capturing the old woman represents non-recognition grasped by the five poisons.
[12675] <prose> The five poisons become one with non-recognition, unified in deluded essence.
[12676] <prose> This is how non-recognition appears in each sense when meeting the five poisons.
[12677] <break> <prose> Going to the daughter's playground represents how non-recognition's essence exists in Rigpa.
[12678] <break> <prose> Rigpa captured in its place represents conceptual grasping wherever attachment and aversion arise.
[12679] <prose> The essence is Rigpa, the reverse is non-recognition, knowing which liberates completely. || 180 ||
[12680] <ornament> The fifth section on reversing delusion presents another profound teaching.
[12681] <prose> In the Jewel Heap Land, an old woman possessed a precious jewel of awareness.
[12682] <prose> Five thieves stole it, causing her suffering in cyclic existence.
[12683] <break> <prose> Then the thieves were pursued and went to the Thorn Land of difficulties.
[12684] <break> <prose> The five thieves stealing caused the old woman to faint into ignorance.
[12685] <break> <prose> Pursuing the thieves from the Thorn Land, the old woman revived through wisdom.

[12693] <prose> The Jewel Heap Land represents the mind as the source of all.
[12694] <break> <prose> The old woman is non-recognition, the jewel is Rigpa, the thieves are the five poisons.
[12695] <break> <prose> Suffering represents Rigpa mixed with attachment and aversion, not experiencing its own nature.
[12696] <prose> Pursuing represents severing, going to the Thorn Land of practice.
[12697] <prose> The old woman fainting represents temporary ignorance overcome by wisdom.
[12698] <prose> Wisdom investigates Rigpa and its coemergent non-recognition with the five poisons.
[12699] <prose> Now in cyclic existence, knowing this, non-recognition and five poisons merely abide in the ground. || 200 ||
[12700] <prose> Thus when the root of delusion is severed by wisdom, Rigpa recognizes itself.
[12701] <prose> Non-recognition self-liberates, like reviving after being severed from grasping.
[12702] <prose> Fire God represents wisdom born of self-recognition, burning delusion.
[12703] <prose> Asking if the jewel is lost, killing the old woman represents Rigpa investigating itself.
[12704] <prose> Seeing not a single hair harmed, not even a fraction damaged, pure from the start.
[12705] <prose> If coemergent non-recognition is not abandoned, it hinders like being stuck in existence.
[12706] <prose> The five poisons self-arise and appear to themselves as wisdom.
[12707] <prose> Looking inward at self-nature, coemergent non-recognition liberates spontaneously.
[12708] <prose> Concepts self-liberate, anger not abandoned purifies in its own place.
[12709] <prose> Attachment purifies, drinking blood represents integrating passion. || 210 ||
[12710] <prose> Ignorance purifies, sucking bones represents transforming delusion.
[12711] <prose> All afflictions become non-existent in the expanse of Dharmatā.
[12712] <prose> Looking inward at Rigpa, self-arising wisdom's jewel is found in self.
[12713] <ornament> The sixth section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence.
[12714] <prose> In the Tamed Land of China, King Li Gardta cast a great dice divination.
[12715] <prose> He sent twenty-one queens as splendid attire to the four crossroads of the great road.

[12718] <prose> Mounted swift horses of wisdom, opened clear eyes of the four lamps.

[12721] <prose> Sought abiding homes in clear light, sought traveling paths of liberation.
[12722] <prose> Then sent them to determine death, cutting the root of delusion.

[12731] <prose> Rigpa's self-light appears directly to the devoted student.
[12732] <prose> Wisdom's horse mounted, riding the wind of prana.
[12733] <prose> The four lamps' eyes opened, seeing the true nature.
[12734] <prose> Scripture's weapon carried, cutting through delusion.
[12735] <prose> Instruction's teeth put on, digesting all experience.
[12736] <prose> Four appearances' clothes donned, adorned with qualities.

[12738] <prose> Five lights' self-radiance home sought, the mansion of clear light.

[12743] <prose> All liberated, siddhi arises naturally without seeking.
[12744] <prose> For the purpose of liberating all with compassion, the Bodhisattva vow.
[12745] <prose> The vajra teacher himself liberated and transferred to the ocean of wisdom.
[12746] <prose> All apparent existence becomes known as the display of mind.
[12747] <prose> Because self-arising wisdom exists primordially within all.
[12748] <prose> The siblings always dwelling together cast into the valley of the empty ravine.
[12749] <prose> Wisdom body never separates from the expanse of Dharmatā. || 250 ||
[12750] <prose> Because it exists as the chain puller of awareness.
