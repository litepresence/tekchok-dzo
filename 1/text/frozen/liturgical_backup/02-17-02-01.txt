[1861] <prose> First:
[1862] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[1863] <verse> Even the inconceivable yogin
[1864] <verse> Is included within the five types.
[1865] <verse> Moreover, that is shown like this:
[1866] <verse> Great potency complete, great prophecy obtained,
[1867] <verse> Great breath emitted, and body half—
[1868] <verse> These are the karma-obeying-action yogins.
[1869] <verse> Thus it is said.
[1870] <prose> The four later yogins are also explained as included within these five.
[1871] <tantra> From that itself:
[1872] <verse> Moreover, the five yogins are complete.
[1873] <verse> Thus it is said.
[1874] <prose> Explaining the five yogins individually:
[1875] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[1876] <verse> All beings of the three realms
[1877] <verse> Are karma-obeying-action yogins.
[1878] <verse> That person who sees the truth,
[1879] <verse> Whose delusion-appearance has ceased—
[1880] <verse> That is the body-mind half-yogin.
[1881] <verse> In spontaneous presence of various appearances,
[1882] <verse> Obtaining certainty
[1883] <verse> Is the prophecy-obtained yogin.
[1884] <verse> That final of final sense-power,
[1885] <verse> Dwelling in the emanation realms of the ten directions—
[1886] <verse> That tathāgata
[1887] <verse> Is the great-breath-emitting yogin.
[1888] <verse> In great primordial purity, unchanging,
[1889] <verse> That which is free from all action and effort
[1890] <verse> Is the great-potency-complete yogin.
[1891] <verse> Thus it is said.
[1892] <prose> Second, explaining the vessel-possessing individual:
[1893] <prose> Generally, the vessel suitable for being taught the Great Perfection dharma is, as shown before:
[1894] <prose> Respecting the guru, great generosity and giving,
[1895] <prose> Great faith, wisdom, and effort,
[1896] <prose> Shying away from non-virtue, wearied with saṃsāra.
[1897] <prose> Particularly, for the supreme secret Great Perfection: possessing the fortune of faithful conduct—one possessing the eight is shown.
[1898] <verse> Particularly, completely giving the teaching of this dharma,
[1899] <prose> The person who holds it, becoming the life-pillar of the victory-banner-peak teaching,
[1900] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[1901] <prose> Holding view and meditation,
[1902] <verse> Possessing excellent faith and effort,
[1903] <verse> Capable of giving, respecting the guru,
[1904] <verse> Observant of vows, shying from non-virtue,
[1905] <verse> Holding extremely unchanging stability,
[1906] <verse> Or long-natured, force slow,
[1907] <verse> Possessing relaxed dullness of relaxed dullness,
[1908] <verse> Few thoughts, slow nature,
[1909] <verse> Free from body and speech action, and
[1910] <verse> Possessing wisdom—such a one holds.
[1911] <verse> Thus it is said.
[1912] <tantra> From the Norbu Trakö Chenpo'i Gyü (Jewel-Arrayed Great Tantra):
[1913] <verse> Kye ma! Listen, god caste!
[1914] <verse> I teach well—retain this in mind.
[1915] <verse> This great appearance maṇḍala
[1916] <verse> Is not to be shown to all.
[1917] <verse> Capable of secrecy, show to some.
[1918] <verse> This secret-mantra, supreme secret,
[1919] <verse> Thus is the caste of the teaching.
[1920] <verse> Capable of seeking the secret,
[1921] <verse> Respecting the secret meaning,
[1922] <verse> Great wisdom and intelligence,
[1923] <verse> Possessed of samaya vows—show to these.
[1924] <verse> Then by the particular assembly,
[1925] <verse> Vajradhara was also asked:
[1926] <verse> Kye kye! Bhagavān Vajradhara!
[1927] <verse> This Great Completion instruction, secret meaning,
[1928] <verse> Is not self-appearing shown.
[1929] <break> <verse> The cuckoo of definite prophecy supreme—
[1930] <verse> Of this person who is taught,
[1931] <break> <verse> Great caste and conduct,
[1932] <verse> We ask the three: color and characteristics.
[1933] <verse> Then Bhagavān Vajradhara,
[1934] <verse> Arising from samādhi,
[1935] <verse> Commanded to the particular assembly:
[1936] <verse> Kye ma! Particular assembly, listen!
[1937] <verse> I shall teach—listen well!
[1938] <verse> The distinction of castes is like this:
[1939] <verse> Royal caste and brahmin caste,
[1940] <verse> Likewise great merchant caste,
[1941] <verse> And to greatly special persons,
[1942] <verse> The secret-mantra definite meaning is taught.
[1943] <break> <verse> Or, examine color without caste—
[1944] <break> <verse> Whatever of the two, man or woman,
[1945] <verse> Possessing this color
[1946] <verse> Is said to be a vessel of Great Completion.
[1947] <verse> From coarse limbs and color,
[1948] <verse> Good teeth, white, conch-like,
[1949] <verse> Slightly red eye-pupils, and
[1950] <verse> Great hair characteristics also:
[1951] <break> <verse> Coiling to the right, dark color.
[1952] <break> <verse> Small respect for the body, and
[1953] <break> <verse> Ordinary outer conduct.
[1954] <break> <verse> Spontaneous words spoken, and
[1955] <verse> Or all kinds of words—
[1956] <verse> However said by one,
[1957] <verse> That person also speaks thus.
[1958] <verse> The Great Completion instruction is said to be taught.
[1959] <verse> When those are complete in one,
[1960] <verse> Whether butcher caste or prostitute caste,
[1961] <verse> Sweeper caste is also suitable,
[1962] <verse> Whatever low-caste, whoever they may be—
[1963] <verse> Give this secret instruction essence.
[1964] <verse> When the cause is small, means lacking,
[1965] <verse> Also prepare self-means,
[1966] <verse> Completely give without remainder.
[1967] <verse> This secret essence, three instructions,
[1968] <verse> The methods of examining caste and color—
[1969] <verse> After I am parinirvāṇa,
[1970] <verse> This secret instruction, again the essence,
[1971] <verse> Thus the definite king is taught.
[1972] <verse> To those persons who are taught,
[1973] <verse> The above instruction should be taught.
[1974] <verse> Thus it was spoken.
[1975] <prose> Second meaning: how to practice, definite in two accomplishment manners:
[1976] <prose> The beggar manner of accomplishment, and
[1977] <prose> The deer manner of accomplishment.
[1978] <prose> First:
[1979] <tantra> From abandoning one's own land,
[1980] <verse> Going to other lands and regions,
[1981] <verse> Making anyone not recognize one's name, good or bad,
[1982] <verse> What is known or not known, and so forth,
[1983] <verse> Hiding as ordinary,
[1984] <verse> Sustaining food and clothing by begging,
[1985] <verse> Going a little far from cave-villages,
[1986] <verse> Or to solitude,
[1987] <verse> Accomplishing without signs in inns, and so forth.
[1988] <prose> At this time: not desiring to show one's quality or name is the sign of not desiring fame, and
[1989] <prose> Not making inquiries or hints about others' gurus, dharmas, and so forth is the sign of confidence in one's own instruction, without doubt.
[1990] <verse> Thus also:
[1991] <tantra> From the Instruction Precious Wheel:
[1992] <verse> In the direction abandoning enemy and friend,
[1993] <verse> Accomplish in the manner of a beggar.
[1994] <verse> Thus it is said.
[1995] <prose> Second, deer-like accomplishment: going to great empty valleys, abandoning three actions, and accomplishing in very solitary mountainside rocks with bird-shelters, or forest groves, or
[1996] <prose> Mountain peaks, or
[1997] <prose> Snow slopes, or
[1998] <prose> Going to great empty valleys, abandoning three actions, and accomplishing.
[1999] <prose> Regarding that also: body actions stretching to the sky, moving,
[2000] <verse> Prostrations, and so forth, and
[2001] <verse> All whatever speech expressions, and
[2002] <verse> Mind's emanation-gathering, different thoughts—all that contradicts self-instruction, abandon.
[2003] <verse> One-pointedly, without distraction, only the supreme instruction should be accomplished.
[2004] <prose> Purpose: body relaxed, channels tight;
[2005] <prose> Channels relaxed, wind-mind nature relaxed;
[2006] <prose> Wind-mind relaxed, thought-force ceases, and
[2007] <prose> Non-thought samādhi arises in the mind.
[2008] <prose> Speech relaxed, inexpressible meaning arises in the mind.
[2009] <prose> For not speaking, the inexpressible nature dwells.
[2010] <prose> Mind's memory abandoning emanation-gathering, samādhi arises as self-nature.
[2011] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[2012] <verse> By possessing faith, mind free from saṃsāra,
[2013] <verse> Guru should be worshipped and giving done.
[2014] <verse> Abandoning all connections with saṃsāra,
[2015] <verse> Abandoning friends, should dwell alone.
[2016] <verse> Thus it is said.
[2017] <prose> Third: showing the actual meaning of practice—four:
[2018] <prose> The yogin who progressively conducts conduct,
[2019] <prose> The yogin who progressively meditates,
[2020] <prose> The yogin who progressively views,
[2021] <prose> The yogin who progressively obtains the fruition.
[2022] <tantra> From the Jewel-Arrayed:
[2023] <verse> The yogin of progressive conduct,
[2024] <verse> The yogin of progressive meditation,
[2025] <verse> The yogin of progressive view,
[2026] <verse> The yogin of progressive fruition.
[2027] <verse> Thus it is said.
[2028] <prose> Thus showing practice in the four: twenty meanings.
[2029] <tantra> From the Jewel-Heap Tantra:
[2030] <prose> That progressive distinction is like this:
[2031] <verse> Practice in one's own system,
[2032] <verse> By the manner of four owners,
[2033] <verse> Also hold the four meanings' essence,
[2034] <verse> By the four, that domain, kinds of rigpa,
[2035] <verse> Cut the birth-continuum of appearance like this,
[2036] <verse> By four placement-method instructions,
[2037] <verse> Self-release appearance-existence dharmas,
[2038] <verse> By the four pure liberation piths,
[2039] <verse> Transform afflictions by self-power,
[2040] <verse> That self-measure arrives.
[2041] <verse> Four examples show self-confidence,
[2042] <verse> By four, great confidence of unchanging view,
[2043] <verse> Also hold the measure of irreversible wisdom.
[2044] <verse> Whoever familiarizes with this,
[2045] <verse> In the nature of Great Completion,
[2046] <verse> By this, the untouchable, unstained samaya,
[2047] <verse> Whatever appears becomes like this,
[2048] <verse> All wisdom is grasped at the core,
[2049] <verse> Obtains the secret great Mahāmudrā.
[2050] <prose> From the progressive practice of distinguishing parts of the spoken meaning.
