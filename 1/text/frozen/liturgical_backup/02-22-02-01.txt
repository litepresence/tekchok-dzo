[10766] <prose> First, the essential nature: vast and expansive, the great identity of clarity, self-illuminating.
[10767] <prose> 
[10768] <prose> The definitive terms are these:
[10769] <prose> It is called the "center";
[10770] <prose> It is called the "expanse."
[10771] <prose> The nature of Dharmatā, the very substance of things, is vast and without limit.
[10772] <prose> 
[10773] <prose> Divided, there is the outer expanse—space;
[10774] <prose> The inner expanse—the lamp;
[10775] <prose> The secret expanse—light and bindu; || 10 ||
[10776] <prose> The unsurpassed expanse—the great display of self-liberated delusory appearance.
[10777] <prose> 
[10778] <prose> Moreover, in progressive order:
[10779] <prose> Awareness,
[10780] <prose> Wisdom,
[10781] <prose> The Three Kāyas,
[10782] <prose> Are the domain of Fruition.
[10783] <prose> 
[10784] <prose> The characteristic is this: since it opens to the vast, has the capacity to appear, and pervades,
[10785] <prose> It appears as the domain of clarity—like a mirror of clear depth. || 20 ||
[10786] <prose> 
[10787] <prose> In brief, Dharmatā is not a thing in itself;
[10788] <prose> It is that which brings forth the power to clarify the domain through which Dharmatā appears.
[10789] <prose> 
[10790] <prose> The result is this: depending upon understanding without error the domain of Dharmatā,
[10791] <prose> Seeing the essential nature of Dharmatā itself, making the unchanging direct perception the Path—one awakens to Buddhahood.
[10792] <prose> 
[10793] <prose> Through familiarity with such an expanse, external wondrous signs manifest as visionary experience:
[10794] <tantra> From the Blazing Reliquary:
[10795] <verse> "One who becomes familiar with the expanse— || 30 ||
[10796] <prose> Their breath, inner and outer movement exhausted,
[10797] <prose> Goes like a bird through space,
[10798] <prose> And like a fish through water;
[10799] <prose> The one endowed with fortune proceeds thus.
[10800] <prose> Together with lands and Mount Meru,
[10801] <prose> And objects not seen before—
[10802] <tantra> From a single seat they behold them,
[10803] <prose> And likewise the Buddha-fields—
[10804] <prose> Those not seen before—
[10805] <prose> All these become visible at once. || 40 ||
[10806] <prose> One possessing such signs and marks,
[10807] <tantra> From this point, in sixteen months,
[10808] <prose> Shall also behold the Dharmadhātu."
[10809] <prose> Thus it is said.
[10810] <prose> 
[10811] <prose> The internal visionary signs are these:
[10812] <tantra> From the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva, these prior signs arise for that person:
[10813] <prose> When sitting alone, experiencing bliss;
[10814] <prose> The body light as a cotton leaf;
[10815] <prose> No desire to be with others; || 50 ||
[10816] <prose> Feeling as if flying through space;
[10817] <prose> The perception of joy when appearances cease;
[10818] <prose> No attachment to body or life;
[10819] <prose> Mind not engaging with any appearance;
[10820] <prose> Awareness clear without sinking;
[10821] <prose> Cognition naturally relaxed;
[10822] <prose> Happiness when with others;
[10823] <prose> Afflictions unable to arise through any circumstance;
[10824] <prose> Even when afflictions arise, not grasping them as thoughts;
[10825] <prose> No attachment arising to beautiful forms. || 60 ||
