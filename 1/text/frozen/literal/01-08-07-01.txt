[10782-10830] This section addresses philosophical disputes regarding the relationship between primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment. The structural function presents dialectical examination of foundational Dzogchen concepts through objection and response format.

[10782-10805] The initial dispute establishes apparent contradictions: if essence is primordially pure, saṃsāra's existence for sentient beings becomes problematic. If nature spontaneously accomplishes without effort, primordial liberation follows. If base is one substance, primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment contradict.

[10806-10830] The response clarifies that essence primordially pure does not negate saṃsāra's appearance. Spontaneous accomplishment's power displays appearances without contradiction. The analogy of dream consciousness during sleep illustrates: appearances arise without contradicting their empty nature.

[10831-10855] The gathering of meaning section presents three aspects: common brief showing, respective parts elaborately explained, and meaning gathering synthesis. The base appears as primordially pure like a conch shell—pure, unmixed with stains, though marks unestablished.

[10856-10880] Nature spontaneous presence manifests as white inside, subtle self-light, depth-clear existence. Though conditions non-existent, outside appearance does not manifest. Essence primordially pure by means of empty, nature spontaneous presence by means of appearance.

[10881-10905] Compassion awareness expands, wisdom arises, base does not cease. The three—essence, nature, compassion—abide as supreme. Empty essence establishes no thing or mark. Clear nature maintains appearance without abandoning self-face.

[10906-10930] The text presents extensive negations of reified categories: awareness not, non-awareness not, buddha not, sentient being not, saṃsāra not, transcended not. This via negativa approach characterizes the primordially pure as beyond conceptual designation.

[10931-10955] Subsequent passages emphasize the inexpressible nature of the base: not established by examination, not calculable, not knowable as object. This preserves the apophatic dimension of Dzogchen view against reification tendencies.

[10956-10980] The spontaneous presence section details appearance aspects: forms and primordial wisdom arise in a place, inner clarity exists subtle, outer extent does not spread. The jewel casket meaning contains spontaneous accomplishment jewel cavity.

[10981-11005] Youth vase form field appears as light clarity thick arranged expanse. Root life-wind five, form five, speech five, mind five, quality five, activity five, primordial wisdom five, light five arise from this base.

[11006-11030] The enumeration continues with channel structures, light configurations, and wisdom manifestations. Channels serve as wisdom's path, drops as nature's movement, bliss and suffering as experienced work.

[11031-11055] Final synthesis establishes essence primordially pure and spontaneous accomplishment as non-different great. Form and primordial wisdom gather-separate not. Beginning-not suchness, self-arising primordial wisdom unique.

[11056-11080] The view register maintains philosophical sophistication throughout, engaging with potential objections while preserving the non-dual presentation. Translation requires careful attention to the apophatic language and the relationship between negation and positive description.

[11081-11105] The preservation value includes documenting early Dzogchen dialectical methods and the integration of emptiness and appearance paradigms. The text preserves sophisticated philosophical negotiation of being and non-being.

[11106-11130] Key citations from Klong-drug-pa, Rangshar, Thalgyur, and other sources authenticate the presentation. The gathering of meaning synthesizes multiple tantric sources into coherent base-view exposition.

[11131-11155] The translation risks include losing the apophatic force through over-interpretation. The dense negations require preservation of their deconstructive function while maintaining readability.

[11156-11180] The structural function serves pedagogical and transmission purposes, systematically addressing potential misconceptions while establishing correct view. The dispute format reflects living philosophical engagement characteristic of the tradition.

[11181-11205] Final sections emphasize the completed nature of the base: original Buddha called, nature spontaneous accomplishment maṇḍala called. Vehicle supreme jewel treasury shows original base state.

[11206-11230] The appearance arisal way presents three paths: spontaneous accomplishment base appearance, Samantabhadra liberation way, and non-recognition sentient beings confusion way. This triadic structure preserves the complete Dzogchen soteriological framework.
