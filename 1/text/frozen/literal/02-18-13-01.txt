[5272] Basis-vision self-resonance spontaneously-accomplish dawn-door body-form-vision-through
[5273] Path-vision exhaust near-from
[5274] Mandala complete those
[5275] Measure is first half-body from body mandala complete until
[5276] Arrive is that-from exceed place not-exist form-vision
[5277] Those moon full form like
[5278] Waxing increase cease-from mandala complete self-essence fabricate-not-exist
[5279] Second measure three particular explain to three
[5280] Outer vision
[5281] Inner body measure
[5282] Secret awareness measure
[5283] First
[5284] Vision control lands light-clear complete
[5285] Thal 'gyur from
[5286] Thus arrive-from complete measure
[5287] Direct entity-vision cease and
[5288] Earth stone vision melt and
[5289] Self-know whatever enter and
[5290] That enter inert move and
[5291] Wind move measure grasp and
[5292] Body dust-particle see arise
[5293] Whatever appear form-body complete and
[5294] That-from father-mother embrace and
[5295] Five five father and mother unite and
[5296] All periphery round to
[5297] Yogin body also light-clear
[5298] Go and come and sit vision
[5299] All awareness measure-arrive
[5300] Thus
[5301] Second
[5302] Body dust purify-from heart center-to white A from light-ray five coil heart-window sun-reflection like intermediate-space light star-window inside dawn pierce
[5303] Crown-uspa-from wisdom wind abide nature-by lift vision
[5304] Urna-from light-ray five fathom one light clear

[5306] Body hair-door etc. outer-inner part dust-particle scope-from small each land realms number-not-exist Buddha and beings measure-not-exist vision is spontaneously-accomplish door eight dawn vision all here exceed lack not self-vision-to vision
[5307] Crown-palate wrathful mandala and heart-in peaceful mandala and
[5308] Body part all-to nature emanation and
[5309] Train-beings emanation and
[5310] Various emanation vision-through Buddha field-in self-vision beings benefit do vision
[5311] Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets and
[5312] Dharma all know wisdom dawn
[5313] Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure self-vision Sambhogakaya complete and
[5314] Mind defilement pure and dust doubt separation itself obtain-from
[5315] Ground and ground latencies self-pure Thal 'gyur from
[5316] Measure-arrive body also thus become
[5317] Individual body dust free-from
[5318] Intermediate-space light star-window vision
[5319] Then light-ray hook shape
[5320] Subtle and coil-through vision hold
[5321] Body dust self-cease-from
[5322] Copper-shining stainless light body
[5323] Center-in A mark and
[5324] Urna light-ray fathom one measure
[5325] Crown-uspa wind-by lift vision
[5326] Peaceful-body hand finger from
[5327] Light garland form coil
[5328] Sound-not mind activity
[5329] Head skull palace from
[5330] Heruka manifest arise
[5331] This time self-body measure-to arrive
[5332] Copper-shining body three one coil
[5333] Thus
[5334] Third secret awareness measure
[5335] Subtle coarse move mind pure although
[5336] All-ground consciousness only mind exist
[5337] Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawn
[5338] That itself from
[5339] This time mind clear and
[5340] Clairvoyance six and
[5341] Far and concealed become
[5342] Dharmas moment-by know become
[5343] Measure-not Buddha realms and
[5344] Thus body also mind-to vision
[5345] Empty mind-to defilement exhaust
[5346] Nature not-move empty-clear obtain
[5347] Unmixed equal-complete expanse-to pervade
[5348] Manifest clear-through many separate-not
[5349] Part not-exist elaboration-not
[5350] Thus
[5351] That-also vision above two-to affliction-mind and mind-consciousness defilement manifest become purify-from
[5352] This obtain time collections eight first seven pure-from
[5353] Subtle coarse defilement-from free
[5354] Body mind connection cut-from
[5355] Outer vision object awareness-to vision
[5356] Investigate agent consciousness part kunzhi consciousness power-by self-condition do
[5357] Star-arrow sky-to move measure-like momentary investigate agent self-dawn that self-free antidote separate-to not-look pure
[5358] Vision above two time-at wind outward throw and inward not hold-from

[5362] Outer extending vision and inner self-vision vision aspect two see-through body mind separate cut
[5363] Realms three-to outward not return ground supreme mandala great accomplish
[5364] Again Thal 'gyur from
[5365] Thus vision time all-to
[5366] Body mind connect cut
[5367] Contaminated exhaust body-from also
[5368] Outward arise characteristic clear mind
[5369] Star-arrow emit manner-by also
[5370] Sky realm-to clear see
[5371] That itself first time all-to
[5372] Wind and separate pure-from also
[5373] Effort and pure wind action
[5374] Body-from outward throw cause arise
[5375] See agent two part-from also
[5376] Body light-clear pure-to

[5379] Vision aspect two manner-from arise
[5380] This-by body mind connect cut-from
[5381] Realms three return not
[5382] Thus
[5383] This time-at see agent also kunzhi consciousness part star-arrow or fire-spark emit like and
[5384] Awareness compassion wisdom part two exist-from
[5385] See object outer inner two see wisdom part-to arise
[5386] This time-at antidote intentionally gaze manner set etc. not
[5387] Always dharmata wheel-from not pass-from
[5388] Practice measure complete by-say
[5389] Fourth dharmata exhaust vision-to two
[5390] Exhaust manner brief show and
[5391] Nature extensive explain
[5392] First
[5393] Before measure-arrive moon full like vision-from
[5394] Self-resonance expanse-to dissolve manner
[5395] That-from moon waning like
[5396] Again body that fade-from bindu-to reach etc. first mind-to certain vision
[5397] That container contents arise abide destroy empty four sequence-through vision four purify manner-to meaning sequence apply
[5398] Birth aging sickness death four increase decrease and also similar
[5399] Outer container arise manner dissolve and
[5400] Inner contents beings life measure up arise and
[5401] Down wane exhaust sign
[5402] Those not exhaust self realms three-from not free
[5403] Thus outer container world exhaust-from
[5404] Support ground not-exist-from
[5405] Return ground not-exist vital point
[5406] Inner contents beings exhaust-from birth continuum cut-from
[5407] Now awareness itself death and separate
[5408] Then vision what essence-as also establish not
[5409] This is this is-not-by express difficult-from
[5410] Dharmata exhaust by-say meaning result
[5411] Result is person-by this is this is-not express difficult thought-by not-conceive cause
[5412] That-also dharma exhaust is measure-arrive time outer object inner body dharma dust together is exhaust-from here kunzhi consciousness dharma mind-by include those exhaust-from
[5413] All-ground part door three dharmata abide root non-awareness that exhaust purify and
[5414] Delusion dharma-to depend-upon
[5415] Vision luminosity arise destroy not-exist that dharmata ultimate abide-from
[5416] Dharmata two that exhaust come-from dharmata exhaust by-say
[5417] Vision is that before spontaneously-accomplish vision exist inner dissolve-to part part-from go time
[5418] Primordially-pure vision cloud not-exist sky like manner pure momentary abide-from vision by-say
[5419] Entity and characteristic-as vision like not
[5420] This time-at dharma merely-to also reference not-exist-from dharmata exhaust

[5422] Dharmata that empty hold part object-possessor-by include
[5423] Realms three mind mental-events kunzhi together return time
[5424] Exhaust manner
[5425] Gradual and
[5426] Instantaneous two-from
[5427] Gradual exhaust is vision four measure arrive time
[5428] Instantaneous exhaust is first dharmata manifest see-from habituation do-from
[5429] Experience increase etc. vision not arise-from exhaust also exist
[5430] This mind supreme instantaneous by-say
[5431] That-also before purify action potential guru-to respect other-from great each merely exhaust manner exist merely
[5432] Second nature extensive explain to
[5433] Essence
[5434] Definition
[5435] Nature
[5436] Dharmata
[5437] Boundary and five-from
[5438] Dharmata exhaust essence
[5439] Outer light five vision body together exhaust
[5440] Inner dust together concept aggregate together exhaust
[5441] Experience vision object exhaust
[5442] Primordially-pure vision sky like manner-to awareness abide
[5443] Thal 'gyur from

[5445] Experience vision empty-from
[5446] Body exhaust sense object also exhaust
[5447] Concept aggregate delusion-from free-from
[5448] Express basis word and separate
[5449] Thus
[5450] Definition
[5451] Dharma by-saying body speech mind aggregate dharma affliction together
[5452] Itself purify agent path vision luminosity meditate part together
[5453] Exhaust is empty
[5454] Mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist
[5455] Not observe by-say
[5456] That itself from
[5457] Thus dharmata certain definition
[5458] Dharma know aggregate gather-to
[5459] Action do and characteristic hold
[5460] Self-vision empty do-to
[5461] Individual families hold
[5462] Itself fabricate not-exist-to
[5463] Natural abide-through real pervade
[5464] Unfabricated original continuous-to
[5465] Sound word name number exhaust
[5466] Thus
[5467] Nature
[5468] Outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity
[5469] Rtsal rdzogs from
[5470] This time exhaust characteristic
[5471] Action-free sky like thus
[5472] Thus
[5473] Dharmata-to two-from
[5474] Vision dharmata
[5475] Outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust
[5476] That exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust
[5477] Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass
[5478] Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain
[5479] All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from
[5480] Path dharma exhaust result by-say
[5481] That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace
[5482] Thal 'gyur from
[5483] Self-Buddha cease dharmata
[5484] Element cease-from dust cease
[5485] Dust and particle end cease-from
[5486] Part merely also abide not
[5487] Affliction cease-from delusion and
[5488] Concept-free attachment not abide-from
[5489] Latency and all-from arise
[5490] Dust part merely also not abide
[5491] Thus subtle coarse cease-from
[5492] Aggregate five also end gradual subtle
[5493] Element four body exhaust-from
[5494] All wisdom Sambhogakaya
[5495] Concept-free samadhi self-abide
[5496] Fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from
[5497] Dharma by-say word-to not abide
[5498] Thus
[5499] Empty dharmata
[5500] Channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust
[5501] Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from
[5502] Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express
[5503] Again before from
[5504] Cause and result dharmata
[5505] Conceptuality coarse source cease-from
[5506] Memory self-pure continuum-from also
[5507] Dependent-arising wind itself fully-pure
[5508] Cause-from arise dharmata
[5509] Primordial-from pure nature-to
[5510] One and many number exhaust
[5511] Body and wisdom not-exist and
[5512] Dharmas exhaust ground arrive
[5513] Result dharmata is think
[5514] Thus
[5515] That-also word later this three-to delusion-from
[5516] Result primordially-pure-to body and wisdom not-exist think Nyingtigpa arise-from
[5517] That error great
[5518] Outer vision resonance body and wisdom crystal light inward return like part-to thus say that intention not understand merely
[5519] Meaning-to inner expanse-to not-exist spontaneous-accomplishment contradict and
[5520] Unconditioned is-from future not-exist completely perish-to go contradict and
[5521] Again expanse-from body and wisdom dawn basis-from beings benefit arise contradict and
[5522] Samantabhadra basis expanse pure end arrive-from beings and Buddha-to path show compassion and action show contradict etc. fault many exist-from
[5523] Fault such accept suitable not
[5524] Fifth boundary
[5525] Measure-arrive curtain-from exhaust begin time self hand foot four finger light five clear merely exist-from
[5526] Occasion this-from inner expanse-to outward enter and
[5527] Outer vision-to inward return boundary exist
[5528] That-also body form that now beings benefit actual extensive not arise
[5529] Finger light-to awareness focus-from
[5530] Outer vision and
[5531] Self body light-clear all inner expanse-to increasingly dissolve-to go
[5532] Direct entity-vision blue pure merely-from
[5533] Light body-to fade crystal light inward dissolve like
[5534] Body and vision self-resonance also reverse
[5535] Inner clear spontaneously-accomplish jewel shell-in body and wisdom depth resonance merely-to awareness abide
[5536] Outer vision blue-in vision part merely also not-exist crystal mirror self-lucid-to shadow like abide
[5537] Awareness dharmakaya-to Buddha coiled
[5538] Outer vision-to inward return body that Buddha action equal not accomplish sign
[5539] That-also birth and enter control-from awareness beings-to compassion focus-from whatever not-exist primordially-pure vision that self-reverse-from
[5540] Delusion vision vision this mirror reflection like vision
[5541] Self body that also water moon like wisdom illusion body-to self-vision copper-shining-from element harm separate vajra body obtain
[5542] Beings benefit-to transfer great body arise by-say
[5543] Other eye not-pure-from dust together merely-from copper-shining-to not see
[5544] Master great Vimala and
[5545] Padma like
[5546] Then birth and enter two control obtain-from
[5547] Momentary Buddha although delay exist
[5548] Beings benefit samsara not empty until do although self-power possess
[5549] Birth control
[5550] Inner expanse-to enter occasion beings three-thousand-to awareness enter all time one-to free power great obtain
[5551] Insects also light-to cease
[5552] Birth control obtain-from whatever desire emanate-from beings benefit spontaneously-accomplish do
[5553] Enter control
[5554] Inert-to awareness enter although move and sound make do
[5555] Lotus and wishing tree and jewel etc.-from dharma sound arise-from beings all ripen and
[5556] Food clothes rain make do
[5557] That-also birth and enter control this two exhaust follow inner expanse-to enter occasion not-there obtain-from
[5558] Beings benefit-to inward not return bardo beings three-thousand instantaneous free make-from expanse-to enter
[5559] Do birth control-from inward return gradual three-thousand free make-from
[5560] Birth enter many kalpa field dust number-to beings benefit whatever do
[5561] Earth treasure and
[5562] Jewel and
[5563] Dharma classification etc.-from time long some benefit accomplish although that means-to momentary also pass not-exist-from
[5564] Other-from compassion wonder arise and activity vision enter cause
[5565] Our guru holy Vimala and Padmakara very sublime such rely those this or bardo without-doubt free certain
[5566] Manner these secret conduct seed tantra from
[5567] Inner body exhaust ground arrive time
[5568] Finger etc. thus vision
[5569] This focus element self cease
[5570] Birth and enter difference-by
[5571] Dharma all exhaust self ground-to
[5572] What also hold not
[5573] Abide is emanation body
[5574] This-by enter power control
[5575] Birth self-power who obtain
[5576] That also that-to focus-from
[5577] Again time thus do time
[5578] Vision self-sound rustling
[5579] Manifest reverse delusion vision
[5580] This-by beings benefit all do
[5581] Awareness equal one cause
[5582] Thousand three beings
[5583] Transfer great this accomplish
[5584] Thus gradual and instantaneous
[5585] Body this-by accomplish
[5586] That all body exhaust measure-from free
[5587] This all result certain
[5588] Ground supreme mandala great accomplish
[5589] Thus
[5590] Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say
[5591] Example ladder rung like
[5592] That also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease
[5593] Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist
[5594] Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from
[5595] Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from
[5596] Dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do
[5597] That itself-to
[5598] Buddha accomplish desire person-by
[5599] This means possess thus thus
[5600] Other conduct pride do itself is-from
[5601] Entity see not
[5602] That cause this all rare word
[5603] Always jewel treasure this look
[5604] Thus
[5605] Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise
[5606] That also unmoving three speech-to basis establish
[5607] Vow three measure hold
[5608] Obtain three nail strike
[5609] Confidence four free measure show those
[5610] Thal 'gyur from
[5611] That-to extreme rely faith do
[5612] Unmoving three-to basis establish-from
[5613] Wind mind vital-to arrive
[5614] Abide three measure hold-from
[5615] Dream reverse and body speech mind
[5616] Sign and measure certain hold
[5617] Obtain three nail strike-from
[5618] Contaminated aggregate not vision
[5619] Thus and
[5620] Mu tig phreng ba from
[5621] Measure is confidence four yogin itself
[5622] Thus
[5623] First unmoving three-by basis establish-from nirvana basis seal
[5624] Body unmoving three-by vital press and
[5625] Speech unmoving three-by path clear and
[5626] Mind unmoving three-by gorge wrap coil
[5627] First body unmoving three-to

[5629] Dawn agent gaze manner unmoving-by path straight
[5630] Bind draw unmoving-by wind go come block
[5631] First
[5632] Mu tig phreng ba from
[5633] Body vital is this three
[5634] Lion manner and elephant manner
[5635] Rishi like know should
[5636] Thus-by
[5637] Emanation body posture-to
[5638] Sound explain and
[5639] Meaning divide two-from
