[9015-9274] This section presents a comprehensive taxonomy of empowerment classifications within the Anuyoga system. The structural function serves to organize the vast array of tantric initiations into coherent categories that facilitate systematic transmission and practice.

[9015-9040] The primary division establishes four main categories: elaboration-with elaboration, elaboration-without elaboration, very elaboration-without, and extremely elaboration-without. Each category contains external, internal, secret, and fully complete subsections. This quadripartite structure reflects the standard tantric organizational principle of progressive subtlety.

[9041-9070] Within elaboration-with elaboration, the external empowerment involves tooth-stick offerings and preliminary preparations. The internal maṇḍala offering establishes the sacred space. The secret level involves protection-cord binding and kuśa grass transmission. The fully complete level encompasses dream examination and prognostic assessment.

[9071-9110] The elaboration-without elaboration category contains three external empowerments: washing purification, request ceremonies, and threefold vajra summons. Internal samaya vows include oaths of saṃsāra abandonment, nirvāṇa acceptance, and commitment to benefit sentient beings. Secret samaya encompasses vows, maṇḍala entry, and mind-flower offerings.

[9111-9150] The fully complete level of elaboration-without elaboration includes deity face revelations, flower-throwing ceremonies, name empowerments, and path-ground measurements. The sequence progresses through hearer maṇḍala entry, self-buddha ground indication, bodhisattva maṇḍala entry, and mind-generation ceremonies.

[9151-9200] The very elaboration-without category subdivides into kriyā, upa, and yoga maṇḍala entries totaling twenty-seven distinct empowerments. Secret mahā empowerments include prophecy, maṇḍala entry, deity revelation, flower throwing, name empowerment, hearing, explaining, benefiting, and power conferral totaling twelve.

[9201-9250] Anu maṇḍala entry contains six elements: definite signs, breath emission, mudrā transformation, action performance, definite entry, and completion. Ati maṇḍala entry includes meditation establishment, flower throwing, deity face revelation, and action-free empowerment completion.

[9251-9300] The enumeration continues with detailed breakdowns: elaboration-with elaboration contains six external, four internal, two secret, and two fully complete empowerments totaling fourteen. Elaboration-without elaboration external contains nine, internal four, secret four, and fully complete four totaling twenty-one.

[9301-9350] Very elaboration-without external contains six for hearers, five for self-buddhas, and four for bodhisattvas totaling fifteen. Internal contains nine for kriyā, nine for upa, and nine for yoga totaling thirty-three. Secret contains twelve for mahā, six for anu, and six for ati totaling twenty-four.

[9351-9400] The total count reaches sixty-four for very elaboration-without and sixty-four for extremely elaboration-without, yielding one hundred twenty-eight empowerments in these categories. Combined with elaboration-with elaboration's one hundred fifteen, the total reaches two hundred forty-nine distinct empowerment types.

[9401-9450] The view register throughout maintains a technical, enumerative tone appropriate to systematic tantric exposition. The text assumes familiarity with standard maṇḍala configurations, deity families, and initiation protocols characteristic of mature Anuyoga literature.

[9451-9500] Translation risks include the mechanical nature of the enumeration potentially obscuring the living transmission context. The dense numerical structures require careful preservation of the categorical logic to maintain the system's integrity.

[9501-9550] The preservation value lies in documenting a complete empowerment schema that connects practice lineages with theoretical frameworks. The detailed categorization preserves institutional memory of tantric transmission protocols.

[9551-9600] Subsequent sections extend the enumeration to wind-based empowerments associated with the four elements, yielding additional taxonomic layers. Each element subdivides into male and female aspects, creating sixteen wind-empowerment categories.

[9601-9650] The text transitions to discussing knowledge-holder grounds arising from empowerment completion. Four yoga grounds emerge: yoga, great yoga, discriminating yoga, and realized yoga. Each ground contains four subdivisions yielding sixteen total grounds.

[9651-9700] These sixteen grounds manifest seven miraculous powers each, arising from different contemplative bases. The enumeration details emanation capabilities, transformation abilities, and mastery over elements that constitute advanced tantric attainments.

[9701-9750] The structural progression moves from empowerment categories through knowledge-holder grounds to activity classifications. Four activities—pacifying, increasing, empowering, and wrathful—each subdivide by empowerment type creating sixteen activity variations.

[9751-9800] The final enumeration addresses ultimate results: lord vajra-holder ground with inexhaustible body-speech-mind qualities. The detailed breakdown includes twenty-four marks and thirty-two major signs complete with emanation field specifications and light-ray propagation systems.

[9801-9850] Throughout the extensive cataloging, the text maintains consistent categorical principles: external-internal-secret-fully complete divisions, quadripartite activity classifications, and numerical correspondences with cosmological and physiological systems. The view register remains technical and systematic, presenting the empowerment taxonomy as an established framework for tantric transmission.

[9851-9900] The preservation of this enumeration ensures continuity of tantric institutional structures. Translation requires attention to the categorical logic while recognizing that the numerical precision serves ritual and contemplative functions beyond mere classification.
