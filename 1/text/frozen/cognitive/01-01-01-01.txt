Architectural description requiring spatial relationship preservation, not inventory flattening.

[81-87]

Micro-macrocosm identity in deluded perception. Within beings' deluded appearance, even one atom's scope shows immeasurable fields beyond count.

Impure beings in homes like dream, enjoying desirable qualities, waking to not see those desires. Known as dream. Seen, heard, known, distinguished, all like dream, untrue. Hair-tip as microcosm containing macrocosm. Non-mixing despite proximity maintains karmic separateness.

[162]
Citation conclusion. One dust-mote's world, appearing subtle dusts contain sentient being fields and arrangements immeasurable. Reiterates micro-macrocosm principle established through scripture.

[163-170]
Inconceivable Buddha-Field and Wisdom Sūtra citation. Hierarchical vision capacity: gods and humans of three thousand worlds fewer than one outsider ṛṣi with clairvoyance sees beings within cart-wheel's extent. Exceeds śrāvakas' eight liberations, one dhyāna practitioner sees more. Exceeds bodhisattvas' eight liberations, one dhyāna practitioner sees more. Exceeds Tathāgata's vision sees more within cart-wheel's extent. Progressive hierarchy establishes Buddha-vision as supreme. Cart-wheel as limited scope containing infinite content. Comparative structure demonstrates quantitative transcendence at each level.

[171-174]
Cosmic pervasion and emanation. Wherever sky pervades as place, sentient beings pervade. Pervaded by Buddha emanations doing benefit. Some directly by Samantabhadra's emanations, some by Buddhas in other tantras, all from Samantabhadra first showing path, generating mind. Samantabhadra's tantric benefit. Emanation hierarchy distinguishes direct from indirect manifestation. Rgyud as tantra or continuum signals unbroken lineage.
