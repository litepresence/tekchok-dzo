Threefold presentation of attainment manner opening. The structure is: general presentation, detailed explanation as result, path-appearance with contradiction avoidance. This is standard Tibetan scholastic methodology. Dzogchen result vehicle—the "attainment" being described is recognition, not production. "Thob pa" (attain/obtain) suggests acquisition—must preserve the sense of recognition of what is already present. The citation from Thalgyur establishes that three kayas arise from essence-display, not created by purification.

Result presentation with Mutik Trengwa and Dorje Sempa citations. Three kayas and five wisdoms as fruition. The extended citation from Vajrasattva's Mirror establishes that all result-dharmas are three kayas non-returning. The controversy section addresses early masters who said "not result"—explained as eliminating fixation on result as reified three kayas, or rejecting three-kāya as merely inner expanse's depth. Recognition: These are pedagogical negations, not ontological denials. Register: doxographical precision. Risk: The controversy appears as contradiction unless recognized as skillful means for different capacities.

Overall structural recognition: This section establishes the Dzogchen view of fruition as spontaneous presence impossible to produce through cause and condition. The crucial point: three kayas are not produced by purification but revealed when purification removes obscurations. This is the difference between causal vehicles (producing result through cause) and result vehicles (recognizing result as already present). The "contradiction" being avoided is between calling three kayas "path-appearance" and "result"—they are both, non-contradictorily. The translator must preserve the subtle distinction between "attaining" as recognition vs. "attaining" as production.
