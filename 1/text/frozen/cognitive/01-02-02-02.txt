Eon first forming beginning, mnar med one being hell suffering experiencing born until forming kalpa. Container content trichiliocosm simultaneously formed. Four continents Meru Brahma empty thousand, first thousand common pinnacle world. Thousand second thousand intermediate world. Thousand great trichiliocosm. Here Meru etc. 10,000,000 abiding. Forming duration intermediate kalpa 20. Abiding intermediate kalpa 20: decreasing one, increasing-decreasing 18, increasing one, three from first: life immeasurable to 80,000 year 200 each decreasing. 80,000 to 10 100 year each decreasing. Second: 10 completion some life taking abandoned that time life 20 increasing. Similarly not stealing 40, wrong conduct 100, lying 200, idle speech 500, harsh speech 1,000, covetousness 2,000, harmful intent 10,000, wrong view 20,000, unwise desire attachment 40,000, wrong dharma practice 80,000. Life increasing form enjoyment increasing, prosperous spreading. Section each decreasing increasing 18 intermediate gaps 18.

Countless passed thunder-decreasing not yet far called ma thog ring mo. In between beings merit appearance from bliss, virtue, Buddha, Dharma. Twenty eons decreasing, standing eon. Twenty eons when humans first appear, increasing eon. Similarly from four great kings to great Brahma. Container destruction: one sun sky extremely hot burning grass trees. Two suns dried rivers ponds. Three suns dried great rivers. Four suns dried lakes. Five suns dried ocean 100 yojanas. Six suns great ocean completely dried. Seven suns Meru etc. mountains smoke fire kindling burning. Fire maṇḍala one below one burning. Beings there all died, wind kissed fire one place gathered, everything burned ashes dust also not remained, completely empty like space.

[1513-1541]
From four great kings to great Brahma similarly. Water destruction: clouds gathered rain fell flooded, below wind maṇḍala supported not sank. Beings there all died. Then fire destruction. Wind destruction: wind maṇḍala upper and lower upper and lower very grinding one above one struck completely destroyed. Last: container-contents all destroyed. Abiding destruction empty three. Uncommon vehicle here 60 intermediate kalpas equal 180, called first duration kalpa. 180 duration kalpas two intermediate kalpas called second. Intermediate kalpa number infinite said. Vessel-content four eons measure elaborated. Now explaining abode vessel-content taming beings retinue.

[1542-1581]
Vessel and content briefly: first aggregates basis nature, second aspects sense-bases distinctions, third apprehender faculties entity, fourth object subject aspects. First aggregates basis nature: five aggregates aggregated, basis dharmatā nature not two thus. Mind and matter two and many not one thus basis nature like. Second sense-bases distinctions: six sense-bases separate distinguish twelve thus aspects like. Third faculties entity: faculties apprehender aware entity merely thus apprehender like. Fourth object subject aspects: form etc. five objects, eye etc. five subjects, both object subject aspects like. Thus explained, here mind consciousness six aggregates basis, abode sense-bases aspects, support faculties entity, enjoyment object subject aspects well explained, root and branch divisions two by habit well explained. The eon cycle demonstrates Buddhist understanding of cosmic time as cyclical rather than linear. Formation, abiding, destruction, and emptiness repeat endlessly throughout beginningless time. The trichiliocosm represents Buddhist cosmos with Mount Meru at center and four continents surrounding. Seven suns destruction by fire shows ultimate impermanence even of physical universe. Water and wind destructions alternate with fire, demonstrating three types of cosmic dissolution. Kalpa measurements provide framework for understanding vast time scales. Translator must preserve numerical specifications while understanding they are symbolic rather than scientific. Decreasing and increasing of lifespan correlates with moral degeneration and regeneration. When human lifespan decreases to ten years, virtue is abandoned; when increases, prosperity follows. Vessel and content teachings establish framework for understanding existence. Four aspects of vessel and content provide analytical tools for examining phenomena. Aggregates, sense-bases, faculties, and objects form complete structure of experience.
