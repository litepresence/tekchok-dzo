This section (15415-15628) presents condensed practical instructions for subtle body work—sitting postures, channel manipulation, sleep practices, and vital point therapy. The architecture moves from preliminary practices through main practice to specific remedies. The view throughout is that the physical body can be worked with to affect the subtle body, leading to recognition. These are advanced practices requiring authentic transmission. The translator must preserve the technical terminology while acknowledging these are specialized practices for qualified practitioners under guidance. The risk notes emphasize that these instructions are condensed and require unpacking by authentic teachers.

The practical instruction section provides detailed guidance for subtle body work. Starting with sitting posture as the foundation, practitioners learn to work with channels, gates, and sleep states. The three kayas sitting manner establishes proper alignment for recognition. Channel vital points allow energetic transformation through specific operations. The three gates provide entry points for transforming deluded appearances. Sleep practices turn ordinary rest into practice opportunity. The seven vital points enable advanced energetic manipulation. Gender-specific practices acknowledge different subtle body configurations. These are advanced practices requiring authentic transmission and proper preparation. The heart wheel serves as the central hub connecting all subtle body systems.
