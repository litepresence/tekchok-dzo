Structural function: Comprehensive aggregates (phung po) exposition—worldly and transcendent. Worldly aggregates: form, feeling, recognition, formation, consciousness—grasped (nyer len) and afflictive (nyon mongs can). Standard fivefold structure of conditioned existence analyzed in Abhidharma. Each aggregate analyzed for essence (ngo bo), cause (rgyu), and result ('bras bu). View register: Abhidharma systematic analysis of psycho-physical existence.

[1671-1731]
Extended recognition of worldly aggregates as basis of samsaric existence: form (gzugs) as material basis; feeling (tshor ba) as hedonic tone; recognition ('du shes) as identifying function; formation ('du byed) as volitional activities; consciousness (rnam shes) as cognizing awareness. Together they create illusion of substantial self where none exists.

[1671-1731]
Transcendent aggregates exposition: Thought-free aggregates abiding in self-knowing aspect of aryas beyond world. Samatha-vipasyana nature as samādhi aggregate. Liberated from own afflictions as wisdom aggregate. Seeing own-common nature as discerning aggregate. Fivefold structure parallel to ordinary aggregates but transformed through path. Not different substances but different mode of abiding.

[1671-1731]
Ethics aggregate for purifying stains. Liberation aggregate beyond all conceptualization. Sense-bases: what arises and expands from what. Six objects like form for eye, sound for ear, etc. Arising and expanding as mutual dependent origination. Twelve sense-bases: six internal apprehenders, six external objects. Not creator-creation but simultaneous conditionality.

[1671-1731]
Elements as basis: five great elements as ground of appearance. Earth-solid, water-moist, fire-hot, wind-moving, space-accommodating. Not material substances but qualities of experience. Eighteen dhatus: six sense-bases plus six objects plus six consciousnesses. Complete phenomenological analysis.

[1671-1731]
Overall structural recognition: This section presents foundational Abhidharma analysis of aggregates, sense-bases, and elements. Recognition required: these are constituents of deluded existence; understanding them is essential for liberation. Translator must maintain Abhidharma technical terminology without reducing to modern psychological concepts.

The aggregates form the basis for understanding selflessness in Buddhist practice.
Through analysis of the five aggregates, the illusion of a permanent self is revealed.
The transcendent aggregates represent the transformation of ordinary existence through the path.
Translator must preserve the distinction between worldly and transcendent presentations.
