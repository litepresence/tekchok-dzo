Crown bliss wheel (spyi bde 'khor lo) enumeration: channel-petals (rtsa 'dab) thirty-two divided (bcas gsum) three-hundred sixty (brgya phrag gsum dang drug cu), petal-small (dab phra) two-thousand nine (stong dgu). Detailed enumeration of the subtle body channels at the crown chakra. View register: precise anatomy of subtle body. Gathering channels (sdud pa'i rtsa) twenty-four (nyi shu rtsa bzhi): six ignorance (ma rig drug), six desire phlegm ('dod chags bad kan drug), six delusion bile (gti mug mkhris pa drug), six wind (rlung drug). The twenty-four gathering channels correspond to six groups of four—ignorance, desire, delusion, and wind, each associated with phlegm, bile, or wind humors. View register: channels associated with afflictions and elements. Wisdom channels (ye shes kyi rtsa) fifty (lnga bcu): dharmadhatu ten (chos dbyings bcu), mirror ten (me long bcu), equality ten (mnyam nyid bcu), discriminating ten (sor rtogs bcu), accomplishing ten (bya grub bcu). The fifty wisdom channels correspond to the five wisdoms, ten channels each. View register: wisdom manifesting through specific channels. Body thirty-eight (lus sum cu rtsa brgyad), awareness channels (shes pa'i rtsa) twenty (nyi shu), bindu channels (thig le'i rtsa) thirty (sum cu), element channels ('byung ba'i rtsa) fifty (lnga bcu), prajña channels (shes rab kyi rtsa) twenty-eight (nyer brgyad), mind channels (yid kyi rtsa) ten (bcu), ignorance channels (ma rig pa'i rtsa) ten (bcu), affliction channels (nyon mongs kyi rtsa) twenty-eight (nyer brgyad). Comprehensive enumeration of all channel types at the crown. Crown great bliss wheel (spyi bde 'khor lo chen po): rigpa and wisdom wind and karma gather and blood and consciousness (rig pa dang ye shes kyi rlung dang las dang khrag dang rnam shes 'dus). The crown chakra gathers all aspects of subtle body—awareness, wisdom wind, karma, blood, and consciousness. View register: crown as central gathering point. Locations seven each (gnas bdun re re): fifty above go (yar song lnga bcu), fifty left go (gyen song lnga bcu), fifty spokes (sor mo lnga bcu), fifty center (dbus lnga bcu), fifty all-pervading (khyab byed lnga bcu). Seven locations with fifty channels each, indicating comprehensive coverage. View register: spatial organization of channels. Outer channel petals (phyi rtsa 'dab): wheel sequence ('khor lo'i rim pa), outside right side (phyi g.yas skor): white conch curling (dung dkar g.yas 'khyil), Brahma aperture (tshangs bu), lotus like (padma 'dra), peacock horn like (rma bya rwa 'dra). Right side channels with specific symbolic characteristics. View register: symbolic anatomy. Left side (g.yon skor): aspects moving (rnam 'gyu), lotus like right left (padma g.yas g.yon 'dra), channel two (rtsa gnyis). Wheel outer rim front ('khor lo'i phyi skor mngon): wish-fulfilling tree (dpag bsam shing), channel root trunk (rtsa ba sdong po), top head crown (dbu rtse gtsug), buffalo tongue like (ma he ljags 'dra), channels forty (rtsa bzhi bcu). Detailed description of left side and front channels. Wind and bile phlegm gathering (rlung mkhris bad kan sdud pa) and aspects four (rnam pa bzhi): desire class ('dod chags rigs), delusion (gti mug), anger actions (khro ba'i byed pa). Four aspects of elemental gathering related to afflictions. View register: elements and afflictions interconnected. Consciousness mount (rnam shes kyi rtengs): gathering mind and prajña (sems dang shes rab sdud pa). Consciousness rides the gathering of mind and wisdom. View register: consciousness supported by subtle body elements. Essence two (snying po gnyis): blood and water-yellow flesh (khrag dang chu ser gyi sha), light and wind color ('od dang rlung gi mdog). Two types of essence—blood-related and light-wind-related. View register: dual essence system. Vital-point specific (gnad kyi khyad par): crown bliss wheel remainder pervading petals all appearing (spyi bde 'khor lhag ma khyab 'dab thams cad snang ba). Remedy methods (gso thabs): vital-letter-from (gnad yi ge nas). Crown top straight letter A (spyi rtse gyen 'greng yi ge A), medicine-speech Nyan thread (sman smra snyan 'dra), bloodletting heart fever (gtar ga snying tsha). Specific therapeutic applications. View register: medical theory integrated with subtle body. Right finger-width KA (g.yas sor KA), Bodhi right (byang chub g.yas), bloodletting ribs right (g.yas rgyab gtar ga). Left finger-width KI (g.yon sor KI), Bodhi left (byang chub g.yon), bloodletting ribs left (g.yon rgyab gtar ga). Specific locations for therapeutic intervention. View register: precise medical correspondences. Risk: letter-mandala protocols—preserve as period medical theory. View register: historical medical context. Translation risk: anachronistic medical claims. Preservation: this represents traditional Tibetan medical theory integrated with tantric subtle body physiology. Preserve as period-specific knowledge, not modern medical advice. The thirty-two channel-petals ('dab) at the crown represent the major pathways of subtle energy entering and leaving the head region. Each petal corresponds to specific cognitive and perceptual functions. The number thirty-two is significant—double the sixteen vowels of Sanskrit, indicating the completeness of the system. These petals are not physical structures but energetic configurations—vortices where subtle winds gather and disperse. View register: numerical symbolism in subtle anatomy. The two thousand nine hundred small petals (dab phra) represent the finest subdivisions of the energetic system—micro-channels that permeate the crown region. This vast number indicates the extraordinary complexity of the subtle body at its highest center. View register: complexity indicating sophistication. The twenty-four gathering channels classified by six groups of ignorance, desire, delusion, and wind—each associated with phlegm (bad kan), bile (mkhris pa), or wind (rlung)—demonstrate the integration of Ayurvedic/Tibetan medical theory with tantric subtle body physiology. The three humors (nyes pa gsum) pervade the channels, affecting mental and physical health. View register: medical theory integration. The fifty wisdom channels (ye shes kyi rtsa)—ten for each of the five wisdoms—indicate that enlightened qualities have specific pathways in the subtle body. Dharmadhātu wisdom (space), mirror wisdom (water), equality wisdom (earth), discriminating wisdom (fire), and accomplishing wisdom (air) each have their channels. View register: wisdom embodied in channels. The thirty-eight body channels (lus kyi rtsa) support the physical form, connecting the crown to the entire somatic structure. These are the channels that maintain bodily function and connect the highest center to the rest of the organism. View register: integration of crown with body. The symbolic characteristics—white conch curling (dung dkar g.yas 'khyil), Brahma aperture (tshangs bu), lotus (padma), peacock horn (rma bya rwa)—are not mere poetry but encode specific energetic qualities. The conch represents sound and space, the lotus purity and unfolding, the peacock horn transformation of poison. View register: symbolism encoding function. The wish-fulfilling tree (dpag bsam shing) and buffalo tongue (ma he ljags) continue the symbolic language—the tree representing growth and fulfillment, the tongue representing taste and assimilation. The forty channels of this region process the most refined essences. View register: symbolic anatomy as functional description.

Wind (rlung), bile (mkhris pa), and phlegm (bad kan) are not merely humors but energetic forces that shape consciousness. Wind provides movement, bile provides heat and transformation, phlegm provides stability and moisture. Their balance determines mental clarity. View register: elements as mind-shapers.

The two essences—blood-related (khrag) and light-wind-related ('od rlung)—represent the material and energetic poles of existence. Blood is grosser, more physical; light-wind is subtler, more conscious. Both are necessary for embodiment. View register: matter-energy continuum.

The crown serves as gateway between individual and universal, subtle and manifest. The channels here connect the practitioner to higher states and allow the descent of blessings. This is why the crown is emphasized in tantric practice and initiation. View register: crown as portal.

This section (15036-15414) presents the complete anatomical and therapeutic framework of the crown bliss wheel (spyi bde 'khor lo). The architecture moves from channel enumeration through symbolic description to therapeutic application. The view throughout is that the crown chakra is a complex system of channels, essences, and energies that can be understood and worked with through precise knowledge. The translator must preserve the technical terminology—rtsa (channel), 'dab (petal), thig le (bindu), rlung (wind)—while acknowledging that this represents traditional Tibetan medical and tantric theory, not modern anatomy. The therapeutic applications (bloodletting, etc.) are historical medical practices that should be preserved as cultural knowledge. The crown bliss wheel serves as the gateway between the subtle and physical, the individual and the universal, making it central to advanced tantric practice.
