Second position addressing momentariness of consciousness implying momentary basis. Three aspects: consciousness as momentary generates momentary basis; consciousness with many thoughts generates corresponding basis; consciousness under afflictive conditions generates conditioned basis. Third position addressing internal-external division: basis as grasped and grasper, basis as six collections to be abandoned. Critique: basis cannot be single expanse because it appears as multiplicity. Register is Dzogchen-sem side philosophical critique. Risk: reifying consciousness as momentary loses rigpa's timeless nature. Preservation: must maintain non-assertive syntax indicating provisional positions.

Seventh position on self-arisen awareness free from existence-nonexistence extremes. Citation from Six Expanses (Klong drug) tantra supporting. Refutation sequence: if primordial wisdom not established anywhere, contradiction arises—expanse must be basis for samsara-nirvana arising; without wisdom, liberation of Buddhas and sentient beings becomes impossible; without five lights, basis-appearances have no cause. Counter-refutation: because essence is primordially pure, samsara is not logical; stains are primordially exhausted. Register shifts to negational clearing establishing primordial purity. Structure demonstrates doxographical method of successive refinement through critique.
