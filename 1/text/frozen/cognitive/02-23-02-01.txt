Contemplation on difficulties of obtaining leisure and training (dal 'byor sbyong) opening Chapter 23's practical instructions. Threefold structure: contemplating difficulty of obtaining to train without intermission; contemplating cause of certain decay to produce emergence and weariness; contemplating simile of certain death to meditate on emptiness. standard Buddhist contemplation on precious human birth reframed for Dzogchen practice. Treating this as generic "precious human birth" teaching misses the Dzogchen emphasis—here it's about obtaining the opportunity for Dzogchen recognition specifically. The six difficulties must remain clearly enumerated and distinct.

[12245-12350]
Extended recognition of the six difficulties as progressive requirements for Dzogchen practice. Difficult to be born: born in Dharma place from karma-ground of Jambu continent—the geographical and karmic rarity. Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments—the eighteen qualities required. Difficult to meet: meeting virtuous friend—the teacher who holds the lineage. Difficult to enter: entering door of holy Dharma—actually committing to practice. Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly—receiving Dzogchen teachings. Difficult to abandon: abandoning samsara's suffering ocean—actually achieving liberation. Recognition: These are not sequential but cumulative—all must be present for Dzogchen recognition to occur.

Extended recognition of the urgency emphasized in the conclusion: "now if not accomplished, later favorable conditions not possible" (da ma grub na phyir bzang thabs med). This is not pessimism but realistic assessment—the convergence of conditions that makes Dzogchen practice possible is extraordinarily rare. The instruction to "meditate day and night in profound meaning without leisure opportunity" establishes the intensity of practice required. Recognition: This urgency is not anxiety but inspiration—the rarity of the opportunity makes it supremely precious.

[12245-12350]
Extended recognition of the contemplation on death as the motivator for practice. The simile of certain death establishes the impermanence that makes the present opportunity urgent. Without recognizing that death is certain and the time of death uncertain, the practitioner will postpone practice indefinitely. The contemplation on decay establishes that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent and unsatisfactory, producing weariness with samsara. The contemplation on difficulty of obtaining establishes the rarity of the opportunity, producing diligence. Together these three contemplations create the mental environment necessary for serious Dzogchen practice.

Overall structural recognition: This section opens the practical training section of Chapter 23 with the classic contemplation on the difficulty of obtaining leisure and endowments. The recognition required is that this is not merely a preliminary contemplation but the foundation of all subsequent practice—without appreciating the rarity of the opportunity, the practitioner will not apply themselves with sufficient intensity. The translator must preserve both the systematic enumeration of the six difficulties and the urgent tone of the conclusion. This is standard Buddhist pedagogy but with Dzogchen emphasis: the "profound emptiness" to be meditated on when time comes is not philosophical emptiness but the recognition of primordial purity. The leisure and endowments framework establishes the preciousness of the human condition that makes Dzogchen recognition possible.

The Dzogchen practitioner recognizes the preciousness of human existence as the foundation for recognition of primordial purity.
Without appreciating the rarity of leisure and endowments, one cannot generate the diligence necessary for practice.
The contemplation on impermanence creates the urgency that leads to immediate practice rather than postponement.
Meditation on the profound meaning must be continuous, without wasting the precious opportunity of human existence.
The six difficulties remind us that everything necessary for Dzogchen recognition is present now, and may never be again.
Recognition of impermanence leads to immediate engagement with Dzogchen practice without delay or procrastination.
Practice now without delay.
Dzogchen recognition is the goal.
