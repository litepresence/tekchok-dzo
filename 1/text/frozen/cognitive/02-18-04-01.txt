Three-kāya posture system establishing nirmāṇakāya posture as foundation for physical practice. Structural arrangement provides detailed technical specifications: feet position for method-wisdom connection, soles pressing for controlling active winds, knee-chest contact for settling bodily elements, straight spine for preventing channel constriction, crossed hands for merging space and awareness, extended neck for releasing wind realm. Systematic presentation serves as practical manual for kāya-specific meditation postures. Perspective presents nirmāṇakāya posture as physical expression of emanation-body realization. Posture of ṛṣi—feet crossed in manner of sage—establishes body as vehicle for manifesting enlightened activity in world. Multiple "essential points" (gnad) embedded in posture connect physical alignment with subtle energy channels and winds, demonstrating how bodily posture serves as support for meditative recognition. Golden sky reference establishes scriptural authority for posture as means of realizing three realms. Technical terminology for three-kāya postures requires precise rendering to maintain specific energetic and realization functions. Term "essential point" refers to specific junctions where physical alignment influences subtle energy; technical usage differs from general usage. Etymological explanation of nirmāṇakāya—body accomplishing various actions, purifying and maturing—establishes functional definition underlying physical expression.

Saṃbhogakāya posture establishing elephant-lying position as support for enjoyment-body realization. Structural arrangement parallels nirmāṇakāya presentation: physical specifications followed by essential points and scriptural authority. Specifications include lying with chin tucked, knee-chest contact, toe extension, hand palm grounding, raised chin. Systematic presentation enables practitioners to adopt posture with precise alignment for optimal energetic effect. Perspective presents saṃbhogakāya posture as physical support for direct experience of dharmatā. Posture enables practitioner to remain continuously in direct perception of reality through sense power of eyes. View establishes body as site of enjoyment—purifying five sense pleasures and introducing them into unborn path—capturing non-dual relationship between physical posture and realization. Golden sky citation establishes textual foundation for posture as supreme body essential point. Preservation note: detailed technical specifications serve as practical meditation instructions requiring precise preservation. Connections between specific physical alignments and energetic effects—controlling active winds, settling elements, preventing channel constriction—constitute technical knowledge enabling postures to function as supports for realization.

Dharmakāya posture establishing lion-entering-its-lair position as support for truth-body realization. Structural arrangement follows established pattern: physical specifications, essential points, scriptural authority. Specifications include soles grounding, relaxed upright body, hand fingers pressing ground, chest space open, neck supported. Completes presentation of three-kāya posture system. Perspective presents dharmakāya posture as physical expression of liberation from all confused fear. Posture of lion—unafraid, majestic, sovereign—embodies view of complete freedom from cyclic existence. Open chest and supported neck establish conditions for rapid appearance of meditative experiences, while finger grounding and relaxed body control active and wisdom winds. Posture expresses view transcending all form while remaining in form. Distinction between three postures and specific functions requires precise rendering. Each posture connects to specific kāya manifestation: nirmāṇakāya appears in world, saṃbhogakāya in pure realms, dharmakāya beyond all form. Technical explanations establish functional definitions guiding proper adoption and use.

Interrelationship between three postures and prognostic significance. Structural arrangement presents each posture as "sign" indicating future liberation: nirmāṇakāya ṛṣi posture signifying liberation through austerity in future times, saṃbhogakāya elephant posture signifying effortless spontaneous liberation, dharmakāya lion posture signifying genuine fearless liberation. Establishes postures not merely as meditation supports but as indicators of realization trajectory. Perspective presents three postures as natural expression of three kāyas already present within practitioner. View that three kāyas abide in heart while posture brings them forth establishes non-dual relationship between physical expression and innate realization. Perspective dissolves duality between practice and result: postures not merely causes of future kāyas but expressions of kāyas already present. Recognition that one's own posture becomes three-kāya posture captures essential view. Preservation note: connection between bodily elements and appropriate postures—cold constitution suiting nirmāṇakāya, hot constitution dharmakāya, balanced saṃbhogakāya—establishes individualized practice recommendations based on elemental constitution. Traditional medical-physiological framework requires preservation for practical application.

Why only three postures definitively established: three postures as complete system for liberation from three poisons and three doors. Structural arrangement establishes correspondence: three poisons (desire, hatred, ignorance) bind beings to three realms, three postures liberate them; three poisons mature into body, speech, and mind, three postures purify them. Systematic correspondence demonstrates completeness of threefold system. Perspective presents three postures as complete method for liberation from cyclic existence. View that three definitively established while more unnecessary and fewer incomplete establishes sufficiency of system. Correspondence between three poisons, three doors, and three postures demonstrates systematic nature of path. Presentation of three poisons maturing into specific body types—desire into bird-body with emphasis on speech, ignorance into pig-body with emphasis on mind, hatred into snake-body with emphasis on physical action—represents traditional Buddhist physiological psychology. Framework establishes basis for individualized posture recommendations: bird-nature practitioners benefit from saṃbhogakāya posture, pig-nature from dharmakāya, snake-nature from nirmāṇakāya. Correspondences require precise preservation for practical application in matching practice to constitution. Definitive nature of threefold system as complete expression of liberation from cyclic existence. View that three postures exhaust possibilities for liberation establishes sufficiency. Recognition that three doors of body, speech, and mind purified through three postures demonstrates comprehensive scope of practice.
