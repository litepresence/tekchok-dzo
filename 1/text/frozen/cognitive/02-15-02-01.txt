Life-holding wind fivefold subdivision with precise locations and functions. Root-holding anchors to channels, protecting provides defense, radiating extends outward, impure processes contaminants, shaking creates movement. wisdom-energetic patterns, not physiology. wind names without technical specificity. fivefold structure as systematic subtle body anatomy, winds abide at crown and heart establishing universal template.

[488-501]
Fire-equal wind fivefold subdivision operating in non-dual correspondence: fire-equal one with life-holding, two with rigpa, three with lamp, four with bindu, five with prajna. winds as wisdom-energetic matrices. "fire-equal" misread as comparative rather than technical identity. wind-wisdom non-dual correspondences as functional mappings, not poetic associations.

[502-526]
Color-radiance producing wind and all-pervading wind complete the system. Color-radiance winds: consciousness-producing, mind-arising, radiance-possessing, consuming, agitating. All-pervading winds: wisdom-pervading, lamp-pervading, awareness-pervading, memory-pervading, body-holding. appearance-making as wisdom function. "color-radiance" and "radiance" conflated. object-correspondences establish perceptual dimension of wind function.

[527-540]
Compassionless karma wind fivefold completion: moving, liberating, reversing, accelerating, instantaneous. Pervasions: aggregates, moments, bardo, thought, three times. karma as movement pattern, not moral judgment. "compassionless" as ethical deficiency. technical designation for non-discriminating kinetic function operating across all domains.

[541-567]
Etymological explanations connect wind system to broader framework. Life-holding: holding wisdom-life; color-radiance: possessing five wisdom-lights; fire-equal: abiding without separation from wisdom-appearance; karma: liberating into wisdom's expanse. etymology as recognition support. "because of" implying causation. precise etymological derivations support recognition of wind nature.

[568-590]
Two knowings establish wisdom framework: knowing-all regarding dharmata internally clear, knowing-all-aspects regarding dharmachan externally clear. natural rigpa capacities. epistemological categories rather than wisdom functions. two knowings as Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya perspectives, integrated yet distinct.

[591-620]
Synthesis demonstrates winds as wisdom display abiding inexpanse without departure. Five winds arise from expanse as display, never separate, never truly arising or ceasing. winds as ultimately non-arising display. "arising from expanse" as causal generation. Kunsal citation establishes three-kaya presence through wind-wisdom integration—body, speech, mind each have specific abiding manner.

[621-650]
Pure original rigpa abides in secret cavity's spontaneously light-clear palace as essence-nature-compassion threefold. Essence as kaya unclear, external-appearance never ceases. Nature as five-light basis, life-wind four limbs as speech essence. Compassion as rigpa essence, two knowings spontaneously complete. Kaya and wisdom without separation abide without transition. all elements naturally integrated wisdom display.

[651-680]
Five winds as life-wind essence, compassion-rigpa wisdom aspect. Pure becomes Buddha wisdom, impure becomes sentient thought-accumulation. Radiating limb winds four as compassion capacity like sun-rays: upward-going prajna horse, downward-clearing light-ray, fire-equal ripening power, all-pervading completing power. Though merely life-wind's aspect, not radiating into expanse, essence abiding in non-ceasing manifestation basis.

[681-710]
Kunsal citation establishes three-kaya integration: body like clear-empty water bubble, speech as limb winds four like fire sparks in rigpa's expanse, mind as life-wind own nature like wisdom fire spark without partiality, essence of essence as five wisdoms. three kayas naturally integrated, not sequential. three-kaya as progressive achievement. simultaneous natural presence.

[711-740]
Wisdom incorruptible by conceptual thought: cannot be modified or labeled, like earth and sky. Clear and minute like five iron sparks. Essence of expanse Dharmakaya, rigpa holds all basis. wisdom naturally pure, not purity achieved. "cannot be modified" as impassivity. Dharmakaya-as-expanse-essence, rigpa-as-holder as technical description.

[741-770]
Chos kyi dbyings citation: dharmadhatu like empty-pervasive sky. Dharmakaya in jewel cavity—original pure ye-gdangs. Rigpa light house in light appearance—common basis rigpa's expanse. Connection with five winds establishes meaning. dharmadhatu as natural abiding. "common basis" as shared ground. ye-gdangs distinct from gdangs, five-wind connection as systematic description.

[771-800]
Fire-five: pervading external-internal, illuminating external-internal, equally abiding, conceptual activity, completing activity. Located in lung, eyes and limbs, flesh-skin gap, soles, palms. fires as wisdom display, not metabolic heat. fire as physiological temperature. fire-wind correspondence as wisdom clarity and movement pairing.

[801-830]
Five earths: universally appearing, unchanging vajra, all-arising jewel, appearance-showing infinite, completing practice. earths as wisdom display's substantial aspect. earth as material solidity. earth-wisdom correspondences—abiding with rigpa, lamp, bindu, wisdom, prajna.

[831-860]
Five waters: unchanging, peaceful clear, qualities-arising extensive, non-grasping, non-holding completing. Located in channels, bones, blood, lymph, eyes. waters as wisdom display's fluid aspect. water as physiological fluids. five-water structure as wisdom fluidity with precise subtle body locations.

[861-890]
Five spaces: universally pervasive, objectless clear gdangs, unmixed pure, meaning-indicating, pure field liberating. Correspond to rigpa, five lights, pure expanse lamp, signs wisdom, twenty-one pointing certainties. space as wisdom display's open dimension. space as mere emptiness. space-wisdom correspondences and twenty-one pointing certainties as recognition framework.

[891-920]
Synthesis: five elements' rigpa aspects gathered are great elements, support is minor elements. Completes dependent arising nature presentation. all elements as wisdom display naturally complete. synthesis as summary. great-minor element distinction as technical description.
