[10699-10721]
Refutation of positions holding permanent and impermanent together. If impermanent things established while permanent not, ability to accept anything damaged. Saṃsāra liberated without recognition, liberated revert to non-recognition, accepting anything without recognizing own face. Rabbit horns and barren woman's son could create saṃsāra and nirvāṇa: limitless endless faults. Teacher spoke: all merely projections of not recognizing own face, established as existing entities through delusion, faults of non-recognition endless. Sixth position: essence arises everywhere, variegated appearances through not recognizing own face. Refutation: multiplicity outer appearance due to non-recognition, or inner consciousness failing to recognize itself, or gathering of those two through delusion?
