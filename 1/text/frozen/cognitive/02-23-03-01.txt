Signs of death in bardo—the visionary appearances indicating approach of death in the intermediate state. In space realm (mkha' spyod), reflections become impermanent and dissolve—this dissolution indicates death approaching. Specific signs: when limbs break in four pieces, death in four months. When head breaks above, in three months. When upper and lower separate, in two months. When rolled into ball, in one month. Connection cord of sky-earth—if cut, cannot exceed nineteen days. From Mount Meru sides, White Lioness not descending—in sixteen days cannot but befall. Between mountain and plain, wish-fulfilling tree trunk breaks—these examined by wise ones. Ocean water vapor dissolves—divided by wise in sequence. Structural function: detailed signs for recognizing approaching death in Dzogchen bardo teachings.

 These signs appear in the becoming bardo (srid pa'i bar do) or in advanced practitioners' visionary experience, indicating the remaining time before death or transition. The structural function: providing objective indicators for subjective experience. View register: signs as natural phenomena to be recognized, not feared. Translation risk: signs appearing as divination or superstition. Preservation: these are visionary experiences with specific time correlations—like medical symptoms indicating prognosis, these signs indicate temporal trajectory. The "space realm" (mkha' spyod) refers to the visionary space of bardo experience where appearances manifest. "Reflections become impermanent and dissolve" (gzugs brnyan mi rtag 'gags) indicates that stable visionary forms begin to break down. View register: dissolution as natural process, not catastrophe. Translation risk: dissolution appearing as loss or failure. Preservation: 'gags pa means "cease" or "dissolve"—the forms that appeared stabilize in bardo now dissolve, indicating transition. This is natural, like ice melting. When visionary "limbs break in four" (yan lag bzhi chag), this indicates death in four months. The four limbs represent the four elements or four directions; their breaking indicates elemental dissolution beginning. View register: body symbolism in visionary experience. Translation risk: literalizing as physical limb injury. Preservation: this is visionary—seeing one's own bardo body limbs breaking apart. The four months indicate the time required for complete elemental dissolution. When the "head breaks above" (mgo gong chag), death in three months. The head represents consciousness and the space element; its breaking indicates the dissolution of the most subtle element. View register: hierarchical dissolution from gross to subtle. Translation risk: gruesome imagery disturbing practice. Preservation: chag here means "break" in the sense of dissolving structure—like a building crumbling. The three months indicate accelerated dissolution as subtler elements destabilize. When "upper and lower separate" (stod smad so sor), death in two months. This indicates the dissociation of the body's energetic polarity—upper centers separating from lower centers, wisdom winds from karmic winds. View register: separation as loss of integration. Translation risk: spatial literalism. Preservation: stod smad refers to the two halves of the subtle body—when they separate, the cohesive energy that maintains form dissipates. Two months indicate rapid approach. When "rolled into ball" (gyang glom), death in one month. The ball indicates the gathering of remaining energies into a condensed form—the final coalescence before complete dissolution. View register: ball as final gathering, not defeat. Translation risk: imagery appearing claustrophobic. Preservation: glom means "gathered" or "rolled"—the scattered energies now condense, preparing for final transition. One month indicates imminent change. The "connection cord of sky-earth" (gnam sa'i sbrel thag) represents the energetic link between the upper and lower chakras, between wisdom and manifestation. "If cut, cannot exceed nineteen days" indicates that when this central channel connection breaks, death is very near. View register: cord as vital connection, not bondage. Translation risk: "cut" suggesting violence. Preservation: sbrel thag means "connecting rope"—the energetic link that maintains embodied existence. When it "cuts," separation is imminent. "From Mount Meru sides, White Lioness not descending" (ri rab gshog gzhir seng ge dkar mo ma babs) indicates that the descending white energy (associated with method and white essence) fails to manifest. View register: symbolism of directions and energies. Translation risk: mythological imagery obscuring meaning. Preservation: Mount Meru represents the central channel; the White Lioness represents the descending white bindu. When it doesn't descend, the balance is lost—death in sixteen days. "Between mountain and plain, wish-fulfilling tree trunk breaks" (ri thang bar dpag bsam shing gi sdong po chag) indicates the breaking of the central axis that supports existence. The wish-fulfilling tree represents the tree of life, the central channel as source of all manifestation. View register: tree as axis mundi, central channel. Translation risk: botanical literalism. Preservation: dpag bsam shing is the mythical tree that grants all wishes—here representing the central channel that sustains life. Its breaking indicates the root of existence destabilizing. "Ocean water vapor dissolves" (rgya mtsho chu yi rlangs pa 'gags) indicates the evaporation of the water element's supporting energy. The ocean represents the vast basis; water vapor its manifesting power. View register: water as life-sustaining element. Translation risk: meteorological literalism. Preservation: rlangs pa is steam or vapor—the capacity of water to sustain life. When this dissolves, the water element can no longer support embodied existence. The phrase "examined by wise ones" (mkhas pas brtags) and "divided by wise in sequence" (rim pas mkhas pas dbye) indicates that these signs require interpretation by those who know the bardo teachings. View register: wisdom needed to read the signs correctly. Translation risk: elitism or obscurantism. Preservation: mkhas pa means "skilled" or "knowing"—those trained in these teachings can interpret the signs. This is not secret-keeping but specialized knowledge, like medical diagnosis. The temporal correlations—four months, three months, two months, one month, nineteen days, sixteen days—are approximate indicators, not mechanical predictions. Individual constitution and practice affect timing. View register: time as flexible, not fixed. Translation risk: rigid timeframes creating anxiety. Preservation: these are guidelines—some may transition faster, some slower. The practitioner uses these to gauge remaining time for practice, not to create fear. These signs serve practical function—they alert the practitioner to intensify practice, complete preparations, or apply specific death-bed techniques. For advanced practitioners, recognizing these signs allows conscious navigation of death. View register: signs as navigational aids, not omens. Translation risk: fatalistic acceptance or anxious avoidance. Preservation: knowing the signs empowers the practitioner—like knowing weather signs allows preparation. The bardo practitioner is a navigator, not a victim. These signs appear in the context of Thögal (thod rgal) practice where visionary experiences are cultivated and recognized. The signs of death in bardo mirror the signs of successful Thögal practice—dissolution of forms, light manifestations, elemental transformation. View register: death and practice as continuous. Translation risk: conflating death signs with practice signs. Preservation: the same visionary dynamics operate in both—the practitioner familiar with Thögal recognizes death signs as familiar territory.[Structural Synthesis: Complete Death Signs Framework]
This section (12522-12778) presents the complete framework of death signs in the bardo context. The architecture moves from general dissolution indicators to specific temporal signs, establishing a systematic method for recognizing approaching death. The view throughout is that death gives warning signs that can be recognized by the wise, allowing conscious preparation and transition. The translator must preserve the visionary symbolism while conveying that these are actual experiences in advanced practice and bardo states, not mere metaphor. The signs operate at multiple levels—physical, energetic, visionary—providing comprehensive indication of the transition from embodied existence to the next state. The practitioner who knows these signs is not caught by surprise but navigates the transition with awareness and confidence.
