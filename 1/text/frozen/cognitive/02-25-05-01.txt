[16436-16439]
Structural function: Opening definition of dharmata from the perspective of "that upon which one looks"—the analytical standpoint of examination. The definition is quintuple negation: not established as any essence, free from elaboration extremes, transcends entity-grasping, without arising/ceasing/transference/transformation, ultimate directly manifest, inconceivable. This is not mere apophaticism but precise delimitation. View register: Dzogchen ultimate truth, primordial purity beyond conceptual mind. Translation risk: Rendering "bsam gyis mi khyab" as "inconceivable" domesticates it into philosophical abstraction—it means "unthinkable by conceptual mind," which is stronger. Preservation: The fourfold negation pattern (skye 'jig 'pho 'gyur med) must remain grammatically parallel.

[16440-16452]
Buddha nature presentation with Hevajra and Uttaratantra citations. The twofold purity formula—pure through primordial purity and pure through purification of adventitious stains—establishes the tathāgatagarbha doctrine. Sentient beings are Buddhas yet obscured; when obscurations cleared, truly Buddhas. This is not potentiality but actuality temporarily concealed. Register: Yogācāra-Tathāgatagarbha synthesis. Risk: The "rigs yod" (possessing lineage/buddha-nature) formulation can be read as ontological essentialism—the text means capacity for recognition, not inherent substance. Preservation: The citation from Sublime Continuum establishes scriptural authority for the Dzogchen view.

[16453-16487]
Vehicle-specific presentations of Buddha nature collapsing into Great Perfection miraculous display. Each vehicle demonstrates rigpa, emptiness, qualities—but here divided through spontaneous display: dharmakaya fields inconceivable, abode as dharmata transcending mind, samadhi as great Immovable. The recognition required is that Dzogchen does not reject lower vehicle presentations but recognizes them as partial aspects of what is complete. Register: Dzogchen inclusivity, not exclusivity. Risk: The enumeration of dharmakaya's threefold aspects (field/abode/samadhi) appears redundant with earlier three-kāya analysis unless recognized as application of same structure to dharmata itself.

[16488-16532]
Extended presentation of dharmakaya characteristics through fivefold analysis: body as empty-clarity without marks, speech as inexpressible transcending sound/words/names, mind as free from thought/conception/analysis, qualities as non-returning without change, activities as spontaneous display without arising or ceasing. This is the definitive presentation of dharmakaya as ground. Register: classic Dzogchen ka dag presentation. Risk: The fivefold structure mirrors the five Buddha-attributes applied to dharmakaya specifically—reader may miss that this is the basis from which sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya emerge. Preservation: The negational structure throughout must remain consistent.

[16533-16629]
Sambhogakaya extensive explanation with fourfold definitional structure: essence, definitive terminology, divisions, enumerations. Essence as rang gsal chen po (great self-clarity) fully perfect. Defining characteristic as unmoving natural expression. Definitive terminology as non-ceasing knowing in the very engagement with display. The four divisions—elemental-essence body, pervasion-mode body, path-appearance body, and disciple-manifestation body—represent progressive subtlety from ground to manifestation. Register: tantric subtle body cosmology. Risk: The fourfold body typology appears as mere enumeration without recognizing each represents different perceptual capacity level. Preservation: The connection to five elements (emerging in first type) must remain audible.

[16630-16670]
Sambhogakaya's speech and activities presentation. Speech as "unspeakable" yet appearing as six-syllable self-arising sound to disciples—this is the paradox of sambhogakaya communication: unexpressed yet expressed, unheard yet heard, like dream-words. Activities as continuous turning of dharma-wheels without interruption. The recognition required is that sambhogakaya functions simultaneously across multiple dimensions: for pure disciples in Akanishta-like fields, for bodhisattvas on the path, for beings in dreams and intermediate state. Register: sambhogakaya as bridge between dharmakaya ground and nirmanakaya manifestation.

[16671-16718]
Nirmanakaya extensive explanation mirroring the fourfold structure. Essence as manifold and indefinite. Definitive terminology as "whatever tames, thus emanated"—sprul pa as responsive manifestation, sku as perfect form. Divisions into common (three vehicles) and uncommon (Dzogchen-specific) types. Common: crafted, birth, supreme enlightenment emanations. Uncommon: impure emanations, world-taming emanations, nature emanations. The twelve deeds presentation for Shakya forms—birth, descent, entry, birth, skill mastery, enjoyments, renunciation, austerities, Bodhi seat, defeat of maras, complete enlightenment, Dharma-wheel turning, including gods, parinirvana—establish conventional framework. Recognition: Dzogchen does not reject conventional presentation but recognizes all as spontaneous display.

[16436-16718]
Overall structural recognition: This is the heart of Chapter 25's presentation of the three kayas as fruition. The structure is: dharmata/Buddha nature as basis (lines 16436-16532), sambhogakaya as expression (16533-16670), nirmanakaya as manifestation (16671-16718). This is the Dzogchen architecture of enlightenment: ground as empty clarity, path as spontaneous display, fruition as compassionate emanation. The recognition required is that these are not temporal stages but simultaneous aspects of what is always already complete. The extensive citations from Hevajra, Sublime Continuum, and Thalgyur establish scriptural grounding for the Dzogchen view. The translator must preserve both the systematic analytical structure and the poetic resonance of the tantric descriptions—particularly the sambhogakaya section with its rich imagery of light, mandalas, and pure fields.

[16436-16452]
Extended recognition of the twofold purity formula as central to Dzogchen anthropology. Primordial purity (ka dag) establishes that enlightenment is not achieved but recognized. Adventitious purity (glo bur dri bral) establishes that obscurations are temporary and removable. The recognition required is that these operate simultaneously—there is no temporal sequence where one first purifies adventitious stains and then discovers primordial purity. The discovery of what is primordially pure and the removal of what is adventitiously obscuring happen in the same moment of recognition. This is the Dzogchen view of Buddha nature: not a seed that must grow but a jewel that must be cleaned. The citations from Hevajra and Sublime Continuum serve to ground this view in Indian scripture against potential charges of Tibetan innovation.

[16533-16629]
Extended recognition of the fourfold sambhogakaya body typology as representing progressive capacity levels. The elemental-essence body ('byung chen ngo bo'i sku) operates at the level of subtle energy and five elements. The pervasion-mode body (khyab tshul gyi sku) operates at the level of light and radiance pervading all. The path-appearance body (lam gyi sku) operates at the level of bardo and dream appearances. The disciple-manifestation body (gdul bya snang tshul gyi sku) operates at the level of individual perception. This is not four different bodies but four ways of recognizing the same sambhogakaya display according to capacity. The recognition required is that Dzogchen practitioners work with all four levels simultaneously—subtle body practice, light yoga, dream yoga, and guru yoga are not separate practices but aspects of one recognition.

[16671-16718]
Extended recognition of the nirmanakaya uncommon typology as specifically Dzogchen. The three types—impure emanations (ma dag pa sprul pa'i sku), world-taming emanations ('gro ba 'dul ba'i sprul pa'i sku), and nature emanations (rang bzhin sprul pa'i sku)—represent Dzogchen's unique contribution to emanation theory. Impure emanations appear in conditioned realms for beings who cannot perceive pure forms. World-taming emanations specifically target collective karma and social transformation. Nature emanations are the spontaneous display of dharmata without deliberate intent. This threefold classification expands beyond the conventional twelve deeds to include emanations that may not appear conventionally "Buddha-like"—appearing as artists, craftsmen, even controversial figures—if that serves beings' needs. The recognition required is that nirmanakaya activity is infinitely flexible, responsive to conditions rather than conforming to predetermined forms.
