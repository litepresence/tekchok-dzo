Structural function: Enumeration of bardo liberation methods for various capacities. Opening establishes the fundamental recognition: recognizing self-face in seeing primordial purity's appearances establishes the ground. View register: Dzogchen bardo techniques, systematic presentation. The progressive capacity framework—sharp acumen liberated instantly, lesser dwell long in realm meditating many days, swift like arrow vs. slow vs. extremely slow—establishes the correlation between capacity and recognition speed. Translation risk: Reading the temporal descriptions literally misses that they describe recognition intervals, not objective time. Preservation: The progressive nature of the presentation must remain clear.

Extended recognition of the liberation methods as natural responses to appearances. Liberation in three moments occurs when recognition is immediate and complete. Liberation through mirror sphere occurs when the practitioner recognizes the mirror-like nature of all appearances. Liberation through father-mather recognition occurs when the practitioner recognizes the union of appearances and emptiness. Liberation through flickering and radiant light occurs when the practitioner recognizes the display of wisdom lights. Liberation arising in own truth occurs when the practitioner recognizes self-arisen wisdom. Liberation through compassionate radiance occurs when the practitioner recognizes the natural responsiveness of awareness. Liberation through two spheres occurs when the practitioner recognizes the union of clarity and emptiness. Liberation through whatever appears by body liberated occurs when the practitioner recognizes that all appearances are the natural display of the body of the deity.

Extended recognition of the various liberation methods enumerated: liberation in three moments, through mirror sphere, through father-mother recognition, through flickering and radiant light, arising in own truth, through compassionate radiance, through two spheres, through whatever appears by body liberated. Supreme capacity beings become Buddha in three moments, emanations naturally arise. In one moment sphere-appearance ceases, spontaneous presence appearance ceases. Recognition: These are not sequential techniques to be applied but recognition possibilities that appear naturally—the practitioner recognizes whatever appears rather than creating specific experiences. The supreme capacity practitioner recognizes so completely that sphere-appearance and spontaneous presence appearance both cease in a single moment of recognition, becoming Buddha instantly with emanations arising naturally for the benefit of beings.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents a catalogue of bardo liberation methods, demonstrating the comprehensive approach of Dzogchen—multiple entry points for recognition depending on what appears to the practitioner. The recognition required is that these are not techniques to be memorized and applied but natural manifestations to be recognized. The translator must preserve the systematic enumeration while maintaining the understanding that recognition is natural, not constructed. The detailed enumeration of methods serves a pedagogical function—it prepares the practitioner for whatever might appear, establishing familiarity with the various forms recognition can take. The sharp acumen practitioner recognizes immediately, the medium practitioner takes longer, the lesser practitioner takes many days—this progression reflects not different techniques but different capacities for recognition. All methods lead to the same recognition: the natural state of primordial purity.

Recognition is the key to liberation in all bardo states.
The practitioner must recognize all appearances as self-display.
