Structural function: Opening of bardo liberation instructions for those of "final faculties" (dbang po tha ma) who failed to recognize truth when dharmata bardo arose. This is the "safety net" teaching—liberation for those who missed earlier opportunities. View register: Dzogchen bardo teachings, practical instruction for death and intermediate state. The becoming bardo (srid pa'i bar do) appears dreamlike, and recognition dawns: "I have died." Translation risk: Domesticating "bar do" as mere "intermediate state" loses the technical sense of "interval" or "in-between." Preservation: The recognition "nga shi 'dug" (I have died) must retain its immediacy and personal quality. The technical term "dbang po tha ma" (final faculties) indicates beings who have not recognized the clear light of dharmakaya at death or the visions of the bardo, yet still have the opportunity for liberation through the becoming bardo. This demonstrates the comprehensive compassion of Dzogchen teachings—no one is abandoned, all have paths to liberation appropriate to their capacity. The dreamlike nature of the becoming bardo is crucial—it indicates that experiences in this state lack substantial existence and can be recognized as illusory display.

[15295-15313]
Preliminary instructions for bardo recognition. Habituation during daytime to direct perception of self-appearance; nighttime habituation to five lights within heart; sleeping while looking toward emanation field; training power through transference during intervals. This is the practice preparation for what will manifest at death. The technical instruction: wisdom-consciousness riding wind projects from heart or eyes to chief heart-center into emanation field. Recognition: These are not speculative practices but direct preparation for the actual process of death. Register: practical Dzogchen phowa ('pho ba) instruction. Risk: The "five lights" instruction can be read as visualization rather than recognition of naturally present luminosity. Preservation: The naturalness of the display must be emphasized. The daytime practice of direct perception (mngon sum) trains the practitioner to see all appearance as self-appearance—one's own mind's display rather than external reality. This is the foundation for bardo recognition: if one cannot recognize waking appearances as mind's display, one will not recognize bardo appearances as mind's display. The nighttime practice of the five lights in the heart center ('od lnga snying nang du goms pa) recognizes the naturally present luminosity that will appear at death. The five lights (white, yellow, red, green, blue) are not visualizations to be created but natural manifestations of the five wisdoms to be recognized. Sleeping while looking toward the emanation field trains the mind's directionality—establishing the habit of looking toward liberation rather than toward samsara.

[15314-15350]
Natural emanation body (rang bzhin sprul pa) transference method. Twofold nature: abiding nature and enumerated nature. Abiding nature: from primordial time this exists as path-appearance, visible in the four directions of spontaneous presence gate's sambhogakaya. Ten fields with central cremation ground blazing fire mountain, making eleven—here identifying the five great liberation breaths. Enumerated nature: bodhisattva grounds as eleven, Kun Tu Od's field as special Buddha-appearance ground. Recognition: The fields are not locations elsewhere but the nature of mind's own display. The distinction between abiding nature (gnas pa'i rang bzhin) and enumerated nature (bgrangs pa'i rang bzhin) is crucial to Dzogchen ontology. The abiding nature is what is actually the case—fields are primordially present as the natural display of mind's luminosity. The enumerated nature is how these are conceptually organized for pedagogical purposes—into ten directions, eleven fields, corresponding to bodhisattva grounds, etc. The recognition required is that the fields are not external locations to which one travels but the nature of mind's own display appearing as fields. The cremation ground imagery (dur khrod me ri 'bar ba) is standard in tantric iconography—representing the burning of obscurations, not a literal location.

[15351-15420]
Five great liberation breaths detailed exposition. First: encountering dharmakaya at death. Second: meeting sambhogakaya in dharmata bardo. Third: becoming bardo natural emanation appearance. Fourth: miraculous birth in pure field through recognition. Fifth: liberation in dharmakaya through birth. Each with detailed description of what appears and how to recognize. Citations from Zhi Tro (Peaceful and Wrathful) and other tantras establish scriptural authority. Recognition: These are not sequential stages for everyone but possibilities depending on recognition capacity. The five liberation breaths represent progressive opportunities—the recognition can happen at the moment of death (first breath), in the dharmata bardo (second breath), in the becoming bardo (third breath), at the moment of conception in a pure field (fourth breath), or even after birth in that field (fifth breath). This demonstrates the comprehensive compassion of the teaching: even if recognition is missed at death, opportunities continue. The technical term "liberation breath" (grol sa'i dbugs) refers to moments when the natural flow of the mind can be redirected toward recognition through the force of previous habituation and the power of dharmata blessing.

[15421-15500]
Detailed instructions for each of the five liberation breaths. First breath: when death approaches, external signs, internal signs, how to recognize dharmakaya appearing in the mind. Second breath: if recognition missed, how sambhogakaya appears in the bardo. Third breath: if still not recognized, how becoming bardo appears as natural emanation. Fourth breath: recognition at this point leads to miraculous birth. Fifth breath: even if birth occurs, recognition leads to immediate liberation. The technical precision of these instructions is extraordinary—specific signs, specific recognitions, specific results.

[15501-15600]
Preparatory practices for those currently alive. Daytime practice: direct perception of self-appearance as illusory, dreamlike. Nighttime practice: recognition of the five lights in the heart center as own-face, not external deities. Sleep practice: sleeping in the attitude of looking toward the emanation field. Interval practice: training the power of transference through the "HIG" phowa. The recognition that these practices establish familiarity with what will appear at death. Detailed instructions on how to project the wisdom-consciousness riding the winds from heart center or eyes to the chief heart center of the field. The crucial point: it is not the physical body that travels but the wisdom-consciousness.

[15601-15634]
Summary and conclusion of bardo instructions. Through these practices, some achieve birth in pure fields immediately; even if bardo arises, recognition is certain. When that time comes, merely remembering the field leads to birth through dharmata blessing—no other hidden instruction exists. The final emphasis: liberation is not achieved through complexity but through simple recognition. The various emanation fields, the five liberation breaths, the detailed descriptions—all serve to prepare recognition, not to establish a complex path. The translator must preserve both the technical precision of the instructions and the ultimate simplicity of the recognition they point toward.

[15275-15634]
Overall structural recognition: This is the most extensive bardo instruction section in the entire Treasury, presenting the complete Dzogchen approach to death and intermediate state. The architecture is sophisticated: it begins with the "safety net" for those of lesser faculties who missed earlier opportunities, provides detailed preliminary practices for the living, explains the natural emanation body transference method, enumerates the five great liberation breaths with exhaustive detail, and concludes with the simplicity underlying all complexity. The recognition required throughout is that bardo is not merely "after death" but the continuous intermediate state of not recognizing one's own nature. The practices described are not preparations for some future event but recognition of what is already happening. The translator must preserve the urgent, immediate quality of these instructions while maintaining their technical precision. The stakes could not be higher: these are instructions for liberation at the moment of death or in the bardo. Every detail matters, yet the ultimate recognition is utterly simple.

[15275-15294]
Extended recognition of the "final faculties" category as crucial to understanding Dzogchen pedagogy. In the nine-vehicle framework, capacity is typically understood hierarchically—sharp faculties achieve liberation quickly, dull faculties require gradual paths. But Dzogchen introduces a radical equality: even those of final faculties (tha ma) who missed recognition in the dharmata bardo can achieve liberation in the becoming bardo. This is not "lower" liberation—it is the same recognition, simply delayed. The "safety net" metaphor is apt but potentially misleading: it suggests that this is a fallback for failures, when in fact it is the compassionate provision of multiple opportunities for recognition. The becoming bardo appears "dreamlike" (rmi lam dang 'dra) because it is appearance without substantial existence—like a dream, it can be recognized as mind's own display. The recognition "I have died" (nga shi 'dug) is the crucial turning point—the moment when the conceptual self-image of being alive dissolves, creating the possibility of recognizing what was always the case.

[15295-15313]
Extended recognition of the preparatory practices as creating familiarity with what will appear at death. The daytime practice of direct perception (mngon sum) of self-appearance establishes recognition that all appearance is one's own display, not external reality. The nighttime practice of the five lights ('od lnga) in the heart center is not visualization but recognition of naturally present luminosity—the same lights that will appear at death. Sleeping while looking toward the emanation field (sprul pa'i zhing) trains the mind's directionality toward recognition. The transference ('pho ba) practice during intervals with the "HIG" syllable is the actual technique that will be used at death. The technical instruction about wisdom-consciousness (ye shes) riding wind (rlung) projects from heart or eyes to chief heart-center establishes the subtle body mechanics of phowa. Recognition: These practices are not creating something new but establishing familiarity with what is already the case.

[15314-15350]
Extended recognition of the natural emanation body (rang bzhin sprul pa) as distinct from the emanation body that appears to ordinary beings. The twofold nature—abiding nature (gnas pa'i rang bzhin) and enumerated nature (bgrangs pa'i rang bzhin)—establishes the difference between ultimate and conventional presentation. The abiding nature is primordially present as path-appearance, visible in the four directions of spontaneous presence. The enumerated nature organizes this into the eleven fields (ten directions plus central cremation ground), corresponding to bodhisattva grounds and the special field of universal light. Recognition: These fields are not locations elsewhere but the nature of mind's own display appearing as fields. The five great liberation breaths (rngol sa'i dbugs chen 'byin pa) are not physical breaths but moments of recognition.

[15351-15500]
Extended recognition of the five liberation breaths as the core practical instruction of this section. First breath: encountering dharmakaya at death—the clear light dawning as the mind dissolves into the ground. Second breath: if recognition missed, meeting sambhogakaya in the dharmata bardo—the visions of peaceful and wrathful deities appearing as one's own display. Third breath: if still not recognized, becoming bardo appears as natural emanation—the dreamlike experiences of the intermediate state. Fourth breath: recognition at this point leads to miraculous birth (rdzus te skye ba) on a lotus in a pure field. Fifth breath: even if birth occurs, recognition leads to immediate liberation without further obscuration. Each breath represents an opportunity—the recognition can happen at any point, and each missed opportunity leads to the next, not as failure but as compassionate provision of multiple chances.

[15501-15600]
Extended recognition of the preparatory practices as the main practice for those currently alive. The daytime practice of recognizing self-appearance as illusory establishes the view. The nighttime practice of the five lights establishes recognition of luminosity. The sleep practice establishes continuity of recognition. The phowa practice establishes the technique. The detailed instructions on projecting wisdom-consciousness riding the winds from heart center or eyes to the chief heart-center of the field are technical descriptions of what happens naturally at death, made conscious through practice. The crucial point: it is not the physical body that travels but the wisdom-consciousness—establishing that this is not a physical journey but a shift in recognition.

[15601-15634]
Extended recognition of the conclusion's emphasis on simplicity. Despite the extraordinary detail of the instructions, the ultimate recognition is simple: remember the field, receive the blessing, achieve birth. This is not "mere" simplicity but profound simplicity—the simplicity of direct recognition without the complexity of constructed path. The statement "no other hidden instruction exists" (gdams ngag gzhan gab pa c'i yang med) establishes the completeness of the teaching. Nothing is held back, nothing is secret—the teaching is complete in itself. The translator must preserve both the technical precision that makes the practice possible and the ultimate simplicity that makes it accessible. contain critical technical terms requiring precise preservation. "Bardo" (bar do) must retain its sense of "interval" or "in-between" rather than merely "intermediate state." The three bardos—death process (chi kha'i bar do), dharmata (chos nyid bar do), and becoming (srid pa'i bar do)—each have specific technical meanings. "Becoming" (srid pa) refers to the process of re-becoming, re-existence, not merely "existence." The term "final faculties" (dbang po tha ma) indicates the lowest of three capacity levels. "Natural emanation body" (rang bzhin sprul pa) distinguishes from ordinary emanation—this is spontaneous appearance, not created display. "Five great liberation breaths" (grol sa'i dbugs chen)—grol sa means "liberation place" or "escape route," indicating opportunities for liberation. "Wisdom-consciousness" (ye shes) must be distinguished from ordinary consciousness (rnam shes)—the former is primordial knowing, the latter conditioned cognition. Multiple translation risks pervade this section. First, psychologizing: reading these as "visualizations" rather than recognition practices. Solution: maintain language of "recognition," "direct perception," "own-face." Second, spatializing: treating emanation fields as external locations. Solution: emphasize fields are "nature of mind's display," "path-appearances." Third, temporalizing: reading five breaths as sequential stages. Solution: emphasize these are "opportunities," "possibilities," not fixed sequence. Fourth, literalizing: reading descriptions as objective death accounts. Solution: emphasize these are "appearances," "display," "like a dream." Fifth, reifying: treating bardo as actual place. Solution: maintain bardo as "interval," "state," "condition of not recognizing." reference the "five lights" ('od lnga) appearing in the heart center. These are naturally present luminosities visible when mind's obscurations thin. The five lights correspond to the five wisdoms and five Buddha families: white (mirror wisdom, Vairocana), yellow (equality wisdom, Ratnasambhava), red (discriminating wisdom, Amitabha), green (accomplishing wisdom, Amoghasiddhi), blue (dharmadhatu wisdom, Akshobhya). View register: these lights are the natural radiance (mdangs) of rigpa. Translation risk: "lights" suggesting external illumination. Preservation: use "luminosity" or "radiance" rather than "lights"; emphasize "naturally present" (rang gnas) or "self-arisen" (rang byung). Recognition of these lights during life establishes familiarity for recognition at death. The transference ('pho ba) instructions involve subtle body mechanics. Wisdom-consciousness (ye shes) rides the vital wind (srog rlung) exiting through the aperture of Brahma (tshangs bu) at the crown or through the eyes, traveling to the heart-center of the emanation field. This is not physical journey but shift in recognition—consciousness was never localized, the field was never separate. View register: phowa as directing attention toward recognition, not moving something from here to there. Translation risk: describing this as if self were literally traveling. Preservation: emphasize "projects" or "directs" rather than "travels"; use "wisdom-consciousness" (ye shes) not "soul" or "spirit"; maintain that field is "nature of mind's display" not external location. describe eleven emanation fields: ten in four directions of spontaneous presence gate's sambhogakaya plus central cremation ground. These correspond to ten bodhisattva grounds (sa bcu) plus special ground of universal light (kun tu 'od). Structural function: complete framework for liberation recognition. View register: fields are natural display of ten perfections and universal compassion. Translation risk: enumerating fields as cosmic geography. Preservation: emphasize fields are "path-appearances" (lam snang), "abiding nature" (gnas pa'i rang bzhin) of mind. The central cremation ground with blazing fire mountain represents burning of obscurations—the energetic center from which recognition dawns. The fourth liberation breath mentions "miraculous birth" (rdzus te skye ba) on a lotus in pure field. This refers to birth without womb, semen, or ovum—direct manifestation through recognition and blessing. View register: consciousness can manifest directly in appropriate form without requiring physical birth process. Translation risk: "miraculous" suggesting supernatural rather than natural process. Preservation: rdzus means "self-arisen," "spontaneous," not "miraculous" as violating natural law. This is natural manifestation when conditions are present—recognition + aspiration + blessing = spontaneous appearance. Lotus imagery represents purity emerging from mud (samsara) without being stained. This section cites extensively from Zhi Tro (zhi khro—Peaceful and Wrathful Deities), one of the most important Dzogchen tantras for bardo teachings. Structural function: establishing these instructions as transmission from realized masters, not invention. View register: citation authenticates teaching as direct pointing. Translation risk: treating citations as ornamental rather than integral. Preservation: Zhi Tro is traditionally revealed by Karma Lingpa as a terma; its citation invokes the entire treasure tradition (gter ma). Specific verses establish five liberation breaths as canonical, not optional teachings. Other citations from Mutik Phrengba provide additional layers of authority. The entire structure demonstrates Dzogchen pedagogical compassion at its most extensive. The text does not abandon those who missed recognition in dharmata bardo; it provides complete path through becoming bardo. This is not "second best" but complete teaching. View register: all beings have buddha-nature; all can recognize; capacity differences indicate timing and method, not essential limitation. Translation risk: hierarchical language suggesting some paths better than others. Preservation: emphasize recognition in becoming bardo is "liberation" (thar pa) just as complete as recognition at death; five breaths are "opportunities" (skabs) not "stages" (rim pa). The translator must preserve sense of comprehensive compassion—no one is abandoned, all paths lead to recognition. The first liberation breath involves recognizing signs of approaching death—external signs of elements dissolving, internal signs of dissolution experience, and the dawning of dharmakaya clear light. Lines 15421-15440 detail these signs with extraordinary precision: earth dissolving into water (loss of physical sensation), water into fire (loss of fluidity), fire into air (loss of warmth), air into consciousness (cessation of outer breath), then the dawning of the clear light. View register: these are natural processes that can be recognized, not feared. Translation risk: describing dissolution as frightening experience rather than natural display. Preservation: emphasize these are "appearances" (snang ba), "natural dissolution" (rang bzhin gyis 'gags), "own-display" (rang snang). The clear light dawning is not something new appearing but what was always present becoming visible as obscurations dissolve. The second liberation breath involves meeting sambhogakaya in the dharmata bardo—the visions of peaceful and wrathful deities (zhi khro) appearing as one's own display. Lines 15441-15470 describe these visions: forty-two peaceful deities appearing in the heart center, fifty-eight wrathful deities appearing in the brain center, all appearing as natural radiance of the five wisdoms. View register: these are not external beings but one's own nature appearing in enlightened form; recognition is key. Translation risk: describing deities as "encountered" suggesting external beings. Preservation: emphasize these are "own-appearance" (rang snang), "self-display" (rang gsal), "nature of mind's luminosity" (sems kyi 'od gsal). The wrathful forms are not angry but energetic; the peaceful forms are not passive but settled. Both are expressions of the same nature. The third liberation breath involves the becoming bardo body (srid pa'i bar do'i lus)—the dreamlike form that appears after the clear light and deity visions have passed. Lines 15471-15500 describe this body: it has all senses complete, can travel instantly by thought, passes through solid objects, but is invisible to ordinary beings. View register: this body is appearance without substantial existence, like a dream body. Translation risk: describing this as "astral body" or "subtle body" importing concepts from other systems. Preservation: use terms like "mental body" (yid kyi lus), "apparitional body" (sgyu lus), emphasizing its dreamlike (rmi lam) nature. The becoming bardo can last up to forty-nine days, during which the consciousness is drawn toward the conditions for its next rebirth unless recognition intervenes.

This section (15275-15634) presents the complete Dzogchen bardo framework as comprehensive system for liberation at death and in intermediate state. The architecture moves from recognition of immediate need (final faculties), through preparatory practices for the living, to core teaching of five liberation breaths, concluding with emphasis on simplicity. The view throughout is that bardo is continuous with life—recognition in life prepares for recognition at death; failure to recognize in life leads to bardo. The translator must preserve both technical specificity that makes practice possible and ultimate simplicity of recognition. The stakes are liberation itself—every detail matters, yet essence is utterly simple: recognize your own nature, wherever and whenever that recognition dawns. This is summit of Dzogchen instruction: practical, comprehensive, compassionate, direct.
