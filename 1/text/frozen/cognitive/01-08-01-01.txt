Structural function: Sevenfold ground nature general exposition—rigpa's primordial abiding through seven ways of natural recognition. Three principal divisions: brief presentation of seven aspects, demonstrating conceptual fixations fundamentally faulty, establishing non-dual recognition of primordial purity and unceasing display as authentic tradition. View register: Dzogchen view presentation through seven aspects.

[10472-10547]
Seven aspects enumerated: (1) basis primordially pure from beginning (ka dag); (2) spontaneously present with qualities complete (lhun grub); (3) uncertain and indeterminate (ma nges); (4) certain and established as actual basis (nges pa); (5) transformable into anything (bsgyur rung); (6) accepting anything that arises (blangs rung); (7) various manifold multiplicity (sna tshogs). These seven represent different ways of recognizing single primordial purity, each perceiver accepting own recognition as complete.

Extended recognition of each aspect: Great sphere free from elaborations represents primordially pure. Unceasing display represents natural expression spontaneously possessing qualities like sun and rays. Uncertain represents nature not established singularly, freedom from extremes. Certain represents abiding without change. Transformable represents naturally appears as whatever manifests. Accepting represents all phenomena arise equally from awareness. Multiplicity represents appears without ceasing, naturally variegated.

Self-arisen wisdom transcends conceptual fabrication, not asserting existent or non-existent. Citations from Thalgyur and Klongdrukpa establish sevenfold manner as authentic tradition. Recognition required: these seven are not contradictory views but different angles on same non-dual nature.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents sevenfold manner of primordial purity through different recognitional approaches. Translator must preserve distinctiveness of each aspect while maintaining their unity as perspectives on same natural state.

The seven aspects provide multiple entry points for recognizing primordial purity.
Each aspect describes the same natural state from a different perspective.
Together they form a complete presentation of Dzogchen view.
Translator must preserve the systematic enumeration while maintaining non-dual understanding.
The sevenfold presentation demonstrates the completeness of Dzogchen view.
Each aspect addresses a different conceptual fixation that might obstruct recognition.
Primordial purity is the foundation, spontaneously present is the manifestation.
Uncertain and certain aspects address the freedom from extremes.
Transformable, accepting, and multiplicity aspects describe the dynamic nature of display.
Translator must preserve both the individual aspects and their unity as complete view.
