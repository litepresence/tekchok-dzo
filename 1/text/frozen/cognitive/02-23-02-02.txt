Meditation on impermanence (mi rtag pa) and emptiness (stong pa nyid). Impermanent compounded dharmas ('dus byas chos) resemble dream (rmi lam), illusion (sgyu ma). Standard similes: star (skar ma), dust (rdul), eye-disease (rab rib), lamp (mar me), magical-illusion (sgyu ma), dew (thigs pa), water-bubble (chu bur), dream (rmi lam), lightning (glog), cloud (sprin). View register: impermanence as gateway to understanding emptiness. The ten similes represent different aspects of impermanence. Star: visible then gone. Dust: disturbed by slightest wind. Eye-disease: illusory appearance. Lamp: dependent on fuel. Magic: created by conditions, not real. Dew: disappears with sun. Water-bubble: brief formation from conditions. Dream: vivid yet unreal. Lightning: momentary flash. Cloud: forms and disperses. View register: phenomena as like these—appearing briefly, dependent on conditions, without substance. Life impermanent like dream (rmi lam lta bu)—dream establishment not exists (rmi lam gtan la phab pa med). Dreams appear vivid and real, yet have no substantial existence. View register: waking life as dreamlike. Translation risk: "like dream" suggesting unreality in nihilistic sense. Preservation: dreams are real experiences with unreal objects; waking life is similar—experience is real, objects are empty. Life like rushing water (chu bo)—by falling water not sit as one (chu 'bab pas gcig tu mi sdod). Water never rests in one place, constantly flowing. View register: life as constant flux. Translation risk: water simile appearing cliché. Preservation: the force of 'bab pa (falling, rushing) indicates the momentum of samsara—life moves on, cannot be held. Life like wind not grasped (rlung bzung du med)—by wind beings not seized (rlung gis sems can mi 'dzin). Wind cannot be grasped or held; likewise life. View register: life's ungraspable nature. Translation risk: "grasped" suggesting understanding. Preservation: 'dzin pa means physically grasping—you cannot hold wind in your hand; you cannot hold life. It moves through your fingers. Life like short-duration emanation (sprul pa)—emanation not remain always (sprul pa rtag tu mi gnas). Magical emanations appear temporarily then dissolve. View register: body as emanation. Translation risk: "emanation" suggesting magical creation. Preservation: sprul pa indicates apparent form without substantial basis—the body appears, functions, then dissolves, like a magician's creation. Life like not-true magical-illusion (sgyu ma)—magical illusion true ground not seized (sgyu ma bden gzung ma byung). Magic appears real but has no true ground. View register: groundlessness of phenomena. Translation risk: "not-true" suggesting deception. Preservation: sgyu ma is not deceit but appearance without substance—the magician isn't lying, but the elephant isn't really there. Life like not-staying traveler (lam 'gro)—traveler not always sit (lam 'gro rtag tu mi sdod pa). Travelers rest briefly then move on; life is journey without permanent rest. View register: life as pilgrimage, not destination. Translation risk: traveler simile appearing trivial. Preservation: the lam 'gro (path-goer) is on a journey—life is the journey, death the next stage. The point is non-remaining. These are standard Buddhist contemplations applied to Dzogchen practice motivation. The structural note emphasizes this application. View register: impermanence as motivation, not discouragement. Translation risk: impermanence inducing nihilism or despair. Preservation: impermanence is freeing—if everything changes, liberation is possible. The contemplation motivates practice by showing the urgency. Impermanence serves as gateway to emptiness—by seeing that phenomena are impermanent, one understands they lack inherent existence. View register: impermanence revealing emptiness. Translation risk: impermanence as separate from emptiness. Preservation: in Madhyamaka, impermanence proves lack of svabhava—inherent existence would require permanence. Contemplating impermanence opens to seeing emptiness. "Compounded dharmas" ('dus byas chos) are conditioned phenomena—those arising from causes and conditions. Only compounded dharmas are impermanent; the uncompounded (nirvana) is not. View register: conditioned vs. unconditioned distinction. Translation risk: "compounded" suggesting complexity. Preservation: 'dus byas means assembled or compounded—put together from parts and conditions. This excludes the unconditioned, which is permanent. "Dream establishment not exists" (rmi lam gtan la phab pa med) indicates dreams cannot be established as real—they appear but lack substantial existence. View register: appearances without establishment. Translation risk: "not exists" suggesting non-existence. Preservation: med pa means cannot be established as real—dreams certainly appear (snang), but cannot be proven substantial (bden par grub pa). The application to Dzogchen practice: understanding impermanence motivates seeking the unconditioned—recognizing that all compounded phenomena are impermanent and unsatisfactory, one turns to the primordial purity which is neither arising nor ceasing. View register: impermanence pointing beyond itself. Translation risk: impermanence as merely depressing. Preservation: the contemplation leads to Dzogchen—seeing all is impermanent, one seeks the impermanent ground, which is ka dag. The similes emphasize that phenomena are vivid (gsal) yet unreal (bden med)—like dreams, illusions, mirages. This is not nihilism but accurate description. View register: appearance and emptiness as compatible. Translation risk: vivid OR unreal (either/or). Preservation: the teaching is vivid AND unreal—appearances are clear and distinct, yet lack inherent existence. This is the middle way. While the similes are standard Buddhist, Dzogchen applies them distinctively—not to induce renunciation only, but to recognize the dreamlike nature as the play of rigpa. View register: impermanence recognized as display. Translation risk: standard application only. Preservation: in Dzogchen, impermanence is not just a reason to renounce samsara, but a characteristic of rigpa's display—empty yet apparent. These contemplations are integrated into Dzogchen practice—not merely preliminary, but ongoing recognition. Every appearance recognized as impermanent and dreamlike is seen as rigpa's play. View register: integration of view and practice. Translation risk: contemplations as merely preliminary. Preservation: while these are often preliminary practices (sngon 'gro), in Dzogchen they continue as recognition—seeing impermanence is seeing the nature of display.

This section (12351-12521) presents the standard Buddhist contemplations on impermanence and emptiness through ten similes, applied specifically to Dzogchen practice motivation. The architecture uses familiar similes—star, dust, dream, lightning—to establish the fleeting, insubstantial nature of phenomena. The view throughout is that impermanence is not merely a reason for renunciation but a characteristic of rigpa's display—recognizing phenomena as impermanent and dreamlike is recognizing their true nature. The translator must preserve the similes' evocative power while conveying that these are not depressing truths but liberating recognitions. The dream simile is particularly important—life is like a dream, vivid yet unreal, and recognizing this is the beginning of waking up to the true nature of mind.
