Inner radiance (nang gsal) and five lights ('od lnga) section. Opens with primordial space (ye dbyings) as clear light within (nang 'od gsal)—like jewel interior luminosity (nor bu nang gsal) not visibly colored (mdog snang med) yet containing five lights ('od lnga yod). View register: inner radiance as subtle luminosity. Five lights arise ('od lnga 'char): white (dkar po), yellow (ser po), red (dmar po), green (ljang khu), blue (sngo)—corresponding to wisdom-activities (ye shes kyi phrin las). The five colors of light corresponding to the five wisdoms and their activities. View register: chromatic manifestation of wisdom. Color-grasping section ('od 'dzin gyi skabs): wisdom produces light (ye shes 'od skyed), wisdom-purity produces white (ye shes dag pas dkar po skyed), qualities produces yellow (yon tan gyis ser po skyed), empowerment produces red (dbang gis dmar po skyed), activity produces green (phrin las kyis ljang khu skyed)—five lights correspond to five wisdoms (ye shes lnga). Specific correspondence between colors and wisdom aspects. View register: colors encoding wisdom functions. Bindu-circle section (thig le 'khor lo'i skabs)—three circles ('khor lo gsum): basis (gzhi), path (lam), and fruit ('bras) bindus (thig le). The three bindus representing ground, path, and fruition. View register: triadic structure of bindu. Central channel bindu (dbu mar thig le): five lights spontaneously accomplished within inner space (nang dbyings lhun grub 'od lnga). The bindu in the central channel naturally manifests five lights. View register: central channel as locus of luminosity. Structural note: connects to subsequent thögal visionary practices. Register: highest tantric physiology terminology. View register: preparation for advanced practice. Preserve technical terms: thig le (bindu), tshig (circle/assembly), od (light). Translation risk: generic translation losing precision. Preservation: maintain technical terminology with explanation. Inner radiance (nang gsal) as basis for visionary experience—not created through effort but naturally present. View register: natural luminosity vs. constructed visualization. Translation risk: "inner" suggesting spatial interior. Preservation: nang means inner or subjective—radiance of mind itself, not external light. Jewel interior luminosity (nor bu nang gsal) simile indicates clarity without color—like a clear gem that is luminous yet colorless, containing potential for all colors. View register: luminous ground containing all manifestations. Translation risk: literal jewel. Preservation: the jewel represents mind's nature—clear, luminous, containing all qualities potentially. The correspondence between five lights and five wisdoms is precise: white (mirror wisdom), yellow (equality wisdom), red (discriminating wisdom), green (accomplishing wisdom), blue (dharmadhātu wisdom). View register: chromatic code for wisdom types. Translation risk: arbitrary color association. Preservation: these correspondences are standard in Tibetan Buddhism. The three bindus represent: basis (primordial ground), path (practice), fruit (realization). This triadic structure is common in Dzogchen. View register: temporal and structural organization. Translation risk: sequential misunderstanding. Preservation: while named basis, path, fruit, these can be simultaneous aspects.

This section (19303-19403) presents the framework of inner radiance and the five lights as the basis for Thögal visionary practice. The architecture moves from the inner radiance of primordial space through the manifestation of five colored lights to the three bindus of basis, path, and fruit. The view throughout is that luminosity is intrinsic to mind—not created but recognized. The five lights represent the play of wisdom manifesting as color, each corresponding to specific wisdom functions. The translator must preserve the technical precision—nang gsal (inner radiance), 'od lnga (five lights), thig le (bindu)—while conveying that these describe natural phenomena of advanced practice, not conceptual constructs. This is the physiology of light in Dzogchen—how mind's luminosity manifests as the basis for all visionary experience.
