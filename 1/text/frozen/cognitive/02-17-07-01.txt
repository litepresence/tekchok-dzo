Dream yoga preliminary practices and main techniques establishing foundational training for recognizing and transforming dream state. Structural function moves from preliminary recognition through three techniques—training, transforming, cutting—to establish complete practice framework. Opening description of recognizing fear-inducing conditions as dreams establishes basic capacity for dream awareness. Register operates in dream yoga technical terminology: dream recognition (rmi lam nams rtogs pa), training ('byongs pa), emanation (sprul pa), transformation (bsgyur ba), cutting (gcod pa), empty (stong pa), appearance-emptiness (snang stong). Preliminary practice of recognizing dreams through strong intention establishes psychological foundation for subsequent techniques. Translation risks center on preserving specific techniques without conflating them: training technique involves daytime practice of viewing all appearances as last night's dreams, then looking back at observing awareness to see appearances as groundless, rootless, naturally clear; transformation technique involves appearing and empty transformation through mirror meditation on deity bodies; cutting technique involves releasing all appearance-mind connections without fabrication. Developmental progression from coarse dreams to subtle, then to forgetting, finally to nothing dreamed with awareness resting in clear samādhi day and night establishes complete path. Technical term "day-night union" (nyin mtshan zung 'jug) indicates final integration of waking and dream states.

Main practice through three aspects: dharmatā-meaning crucial point, means and focus crucial point, and channel-wind binding crucial point. Structural function presents these as integrated dimensions of practice, with threefold training serving as foundation. Instruction that while some say doing one or two is sufficient for those with lesser capacity, here all three are trained establishes comprehensive approach. Register maintains technical terminology: dharmatā-meaning (chos nyid don), means (thabs), focus (dmigs pa), channel-wind binding (rtsa rlung chings). Training technique emphasizes strong intention and looking back at awareness to see groundless appearances, establishing reflexive recognition essential to practice. Preservation requires maintaining hierarchical relationship between preliminary and main practices without diminishing either. Description of training transforming cutting as "extremely difficult" for some while "easy" for others acknowledges different capacities while affirming completeness of full practice.

Specific techniques for dream transformation establishing methods for working with appearance and emptiness in dream state. Structural function moves from appearance transformation to empty transformation, presenting two complementary approaches. Appearance transformation involves deity body meditation using mirrors, transforming all appearances into divine maṇḍalas, pure realms, or eight similes of illusion. Register operates in transformation terminology: appearance transformation (snang ba bsgyur ba), empty transformation (stong par bsgyur ba), mirror (me long), deity body (lha'i sku), divine maṇḍala (lha'i dkyil 'khor), pure realm (sangs rgyas kyi zhing), eight similes of illusion (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad). Eight similes refer to standard Buddhist list: illusion, dream, mirage, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, rainbow, and water-moon. Translation risks center on preserving specific visualizations while maintaining technical function. Empty transformation—like clouds or mist clearing in space—establishes dissolution aspect complementary to appearance aspect. Both must be practiced with strong intention to accomplish transformation in dreams.

Dream training conclusion with cutting technique and introduction of means and focus crucial points: churning, squeezing, and throwing to crucial point. Structural function presents cutting as non-dual resolution of previous techniques, then transitions to wind and mind practices supporting dream yoga. Register maintains cutting terminology: not establishing apprehension in space, not apprehending appearance's reflection, appearance-mind connection, self-clear awareness. Technique of releasing into spacious clarity without fabrication establishes non-dual completion of practice. Preservation requires maintaining progression from dualistic training through non-dual cutting without imposing external philosophical frameworks. Introduction of churning, squeezing, and throwing indicates next level of practice involving subtle body work, establishing transition to channel-wind binding techniques supporting advanced dream yoga.
