The opening verse describes the first pure red perfect empowerment, round and complete self-clear. Two pure fingers become three—pressing again, the five wisdom colors appear without effort. This marks the advanced stage of thogal practice where visionary appearances stabilize and multiply. The view register emphasizes spontaneous arising without contrivance. Translation must preserve the technical vocabulary of "pure" and "self-clear" while conveying the sense of natural perfection.

[9086-9093]
The wind portion moves without effort, mirror-pure shapes appearing as portions. From continuous familiarization, five-color light appears, edge-cut from the slice. The structural function marks the progression from initial appearances to mature vision. The imagery of mirror-pure shapes and five-color light establishes the visual vocabulary of advanced practice. Translation risk lies in rendering the technical terms precisely while maintaining the poetic quality.

[9094-9101]
The bindu center with body, abiding in pure half-body, five-five pairs connected—this describes the stabilization of visionary anatomy. Father-mother body appearance, pure field from delusion ceasing, all measures and signs arise. The view register shows how conventional perception transforms into pure vision. Translation must preserve the "father-mother" terminology and its significance in tantric cosmology.

[9102-9116]
The wisdom-perfect appearance is space; true nature pure appearance is awareness; bindu-ripened appearance from body as mandala—these three appearances complete the visionary framework. The structural function integrates the visionary progression into the broader context of practice. The timing instructions establish diligence levels: three years for excellent, five for middle, seven months eleven days for last. This provides concrete benchmarks for practice assessment.

[9117-9128]
The day-night cycle section presents four aspects: gathering sense faculty essential points closes the doorway of memory, placing knowable objects in the vase causes wisdom to dawn at dawn, morning wisdom clear showing brings rise and fall experiences to self-purification, daytime appearance radiance suppresses all signs. This establishes the round-the-clock practice schedule. Translation must preserve the technical vocabulary while conveying the practical application.

[9129-9147]
The daytime practice uses elephant gaze for direct perception, letting deluded appearances self-release. Nighttime places awareness on the thigle empty lamp, expanding and contracting awareness with the thigle. Before sleep, placing mind in the thigle empty space recognizes sleep luminosity. At midnight, holding mind on inner heart luminosity liberates dream into luminosity, cutting the stream of habitual patterns.

[9148-9176]
Dawn practice uses lion gaze on the bow-length sky on white A, causing empty-clear free from elaboration to arise from within. The citations from Klong Drugpa support the gaze instructions and the continuous practice approach. The structural function demonstrates how thogal integrates with all times of day. The view register maintains that day and night practice leads to deluded appearances self-releasing and liberation into luminosity.

[9177-9207]
The body, sense objects, and awareness measure the pure appearances of self-appearance. When such self-appearance measures are taken, the deluded appearances of the six migrations cease. When that very ceasing occurs, awareness arrives at the measuring line. When that measuring line is reached, even one's own body is not seen—the flesh and blood body produced by elements self-purifies in the elements. Translation must preserve the measuring imagery while conveying its metaphorical significance.

[9208-9222]
The distinction between light body and concentration body: light body is awareness's own radiance without defilement, visible to buddha eye but not sentient beings. Concentration deity body is ripened habitual patterns, extremely subtle element particles, visible to those with divine eye. This clarifies the ontological status of different visionary bodies. The structural transition moves to explaining the wheel of wisdom space expanse in detail.

The Thogal practice progresses through stages of increasing clarity and stability.
Initial appearances may be faint or unstable, but with continued practice they become vivid and consistent.
The timing instructions provide benchmarks for practice assessment without becoming rigid requirements.
Diligence in practice leads to faster recognition, but the natural state is always available regardless of timeline.
The day-night practice cycle ensures continuous engagement with the recognition process.
Translator must preserve the practical instructions while understanding they point to natural processes.
