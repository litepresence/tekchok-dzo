[11825-12002]
Signs of birth in hell realms (dmyal ba)—the negative outcomes of destructive karma manifesting at death. At death: sky gathers black clouds (gnam nag gi sprin 'dus), darkness spreading (mun pa khyab), rain (char), mist (khug rna), great wind (rlung chen), hail (ser ba), dust-whirlwinds (rdul gyi rlung 'khyil ba)—these signs indicate taking birth in the eight hot hells (tsha dmyal brgyad), eight cold hells (grang dmyal brgyad), intermittent hells (nyi tshe ba), neighboring hells (nya lde ba), Avīci (mnar med), seven vajra hells (rdo rje'i dmyal ba bdun). View register: signs as warnings, not condemnations. The signs at death indicate the destination—black clouds, darkness, rain, mist, wind, hail, dust-whirlwinds all represent the confused, turbulent states leading to hell birth. View register: external signs reflecting internal karma. Translation risk: signs appearing as punishment. Preservation: these are natural results of causes, not punishments. Destructive actions create turbulent mind-states that manifest as hell experiences. The eight hot hells (tsha dmyal brgyad) vary in intensity: Reviving (sos), Black Line (thig nag), Crushing (bsdus 'joms), Wailing (ngu 'bod), Great Wailing (ngu 'bod chen po), Heating (tsha), Great Heating (tsha chen po), Avīci (mnar med). Each has specific sufferings—burning, crushing, wailing. View register: hells as experiences of extreme affliction, not physical places. Translation risk: literal hells as eternal torture. Preservation: dmyal ba means "torture" or "extreme suffering"—these are experiences created by extreme hatred and violence, not locations. The eight cold hells (grang dmyal brgyad) are: Blisters (chu bur can), Burst Blisters (chu bur rdol ba), Teeth-Chattering (so tham tham pa), Lamentation (a chu zer ba), Groaning (kyi hud zer ba), Cracking like Lotus (padma ltar gas pa), Cracking like Big Lotus (padma chen po ltar gas pa). Extreme cold causing physical destruction. View register: cold as freezing of compassion, numbness of heart. Translation risk: sadistic imagery. Preservation: these describe states of frozen emotion—extreme cold represents the freezing of the heart's natural warmth. Intermittent hells (nyi tshe ba) appear sporadically in various locations. Neighboring hells (nya lde ba) surround the main hells. View register: variation in suffering intensity and location. Translation risk: taxonomic obsession. Preservation: the classification indicates different types of suffering experiences, not merely organizational categories. Some sufferings are continuous, others intermittent. Avīci (mnar med) means "uninterrupted"—the most intense hot hell where suffering is continuous without respite. Last two hot hells are included in eight but distinguished due to long lifespan and great suffering. View register: Avīci as extreme result of extreme harm. Translation risk: "uninterrupted" suggesting eternal. Preservation: even Avīci is not eternal—nothing in samsara is permanent. But the lifespan is measured in aeons, seeming eternal to the sufferer. The seven vajra hells (rdo rje'i dmyal ba bdun) are specific to certain tantric traditions, representing unbreakable suffering. View register: vajra indicating indestructibility of karma's result. Translation risk: additional hells suggesting sadistic theology. Preservation: rdo rje here means unbreakable—the karma creating these experiences is extremely heavy, the results correspondingly intense. "Karma of immediate actions" (mngon spyod kyi las) bear fruit immediately in this life or the next. These are the ten non-virtues taken to extreme: killing father, mother, arhat, harming Buddha, dividing sangha, etc. View register: immediate ripening as natural law, not punishment. Translation risk: "immediate" suggesting quick justice. Preservation: mngon spyod means "manifest"—the results are immediate because the causes are so powerful. This is natural law, not moral judgment. "All who take birth in last hot hell dwell one intermediate kalpa; those who abandoned Dharma remain billions of kalpas—called Unbearable Sentient-Being Hell" (tsha dmyal tha ma der skyes pa thams cad bar bskal pa gcig na gnas te chos spong ba rnams bskal pa bye ba na gnas pas sems can dmyal ba mi bzad par grags). View register: vast time as result of vast harm. Translation risk: eternal damnation theology. Preservation: "billions of kalpas" is finite, though vast. The "Unbearable" indicates intensity, not permanence. "Breaking samaya with vajra guru produces long lifespans and great suffering" (rdo rje'i bla ma dang dam tshig 'gal na tshe ring thung mi za sdug bsngal chen po 'byung). Breaking commitment with the tantric teacher creates especially heavy karma. View register: samaya as sacred bond, breaking it as deep violation. Translation risk: fear-based control. Preservation: samaya is the bond of trust and transmission; breaking it severs the connection to enlightenment. The suffering comes from losing that connection, not from external punishment. The detailed taxonomy serves recognition—knowing these signs and destinations motivates practice and virtue. View register: knowledge empowering choice. Translation risk: hell-descriptions creating fear-attachment. Preservation: the descriptions are true at the level of experience—extreme negativity creates extreme suffering. Knowing this, the practitioner chooses virtue. This is education, not intimidation. Recognizing signs of hell birth allows the dying person to apply countermeasures—practices, prayers, guru yoga—to redirect the trajectory. View register: signs as navigational warnings, not fixed destinies. Translation risk: signs appearing as irreversible sentences. Preservation: until the moment of death, redirection is possible. The signs indicate current trajectory; practice can change course. The structural note indicates this is "Buddhist hell realm taxonomy for recognizing negative outcomes." View register: taxonomy serving practical recognition, not speculative cosmology. Translation risk: hell-descriptions appearing as fear tactics. Preservation: the purpose is recognition—seeing where destructive actions lead. This empowers the practitioner to avoid creating such causes. In Buddhist view, even hell experiences serve as teachers—extreme suffering creates powerful motivation for liberation. View register: all experiences potentially leading to awakening. Translation risk: justifying suffering or hell. Preservation: not that suffering is good, but that it can be transformative. The Buddha's compassion includes beings in hell, working for their eventual liberation. Crucially, hell is not eternal—no state in samsara is permanent. Eventually, the karma exhausting, the being leaves hell and continues in the cycle. View register: hope within even worst situations. Translation risk: hell's temporariness minimizing its horror. Preservation: while not eternal, hell can last aeons—vast suffering for vast time. This is serious, but not hopeless.

This section (11825-12002) presents the complete framework for recognizing signs of hell birth at death. The architecture details the visions and experiences indicating various hell destinations. The view throughout is that these are natural results of destructive actions, not punishments; they serve as warnings and motivations for practice. The translator must preserve the specificity of the hell classifications while conveying that these are experiences created by mind, not external tortures. Breaking samaya with the guru creates especially heavy results, emphasizing the importance of proper relationship. Yet even the worst hell is temporary—all beings eventually find liberation through the Buddha's compassion and their own ripening karma.
