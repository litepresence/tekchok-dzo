[1589-1609]
Four enlightened activities through color-symbolism. White pacifying (dkar po chos nyid zhi ba) mapped to dharmatā, crystal purity metaphor (shel gong dag pa). Yellow enriching (ser po rgyas pa) mapped to abundance, wish-fulfilling jewel (nor bu rin po che). activity as wisdom display, not achieved power. color-activity as general symbolism. technical tantric mappings—white-pacifying-dharmatā, yellow-enriching-abundance.

[1610-1636]
Powerful and fierce activities. Red powerful (dmar po dbang) mapped to self-existing ground (ma btsal gzhi la grub pa), gold metaphor (rin chen gser). Green fierce (ljangs gu drag po) mapped to unobstructed manifestation (thogs med 'char ba), wind force (rlung gi sprul pa). fierce as energetic-unobstructed, not aggressive. drag po as violent. four-activity system complete—pacifying, enriching, powerful, fierce.

[1637]
Transition to being-time exposition. Temporal frame (sems can gyi dus) without abandoning non-temporal ground. Shift from gnas lugs (abiding manner) to snang lugs (appearance manner). View register: timeless-time structure. temporal language as historicization. Preservation: ground-display relationship without dualism.
