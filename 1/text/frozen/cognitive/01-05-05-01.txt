Empowerment framework establishment. Threefold structure defines the empowerment process: basis for entering (prerequisites), actual path (method), and completed result (attainment).

Structural clarity preserves the progressive logic: preparation, practice, fruition.

Fourfold operational framework. Enumeration of preparatory components: guru qualifications, student nature, shared Dharma activities, empowerment methodology. The sequential structure (dang po la bzhi ste) establishes logical order of treatment. Dbang gi bya ba—empowerment activity—encompasses both ritual performance and transformative function. Preserve the categorical precision; these four constitute complete causal basis for valid transmission.

The six-formula provides mnemonic summary of preceding detailed enumeration. bridge between idealized citation and practical qualification. Preserve each characteristic's distinct emphasis without merging categories.
