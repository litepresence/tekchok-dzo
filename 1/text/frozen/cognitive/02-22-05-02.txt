Overall structural recognition: This section presents the standard Mahāyāna ground system to establish comparative framework for Dzogchen. These grounds are progressive stages of realization, not locations. Signs described (trembling south, trembling from above) are traditional indicators of spiritual attainment. Translator must preserve systematic enumeration while maintaining understanding that Dzogchen transcends yet includes these stages. The progression through grounds represents increasing subtlety of realization, with each ground eliminating specific obscurations.

The ground system provides a map of the spiritual journey from ordinary being to complete awakening.
Each ground represents a stage where specific obscurations are eliminated and qualities are realized.
The Hearer's four grounds focus on liberation from samsara for oneself.
The Bodhisattva's eleven grounds focus on awakening for the benefit of all beings.
Dzogchen recognizes these stages while pointing directly to the nature of mind beyond gradual progression.
The signs of attainment described are traditional indicators recognized in Tibetan Buddhism.
Trembling south in six days indicates the Bodhisattva's compassionate orientation toward beings.
Trembling from above with sound in nine days indicates the Vidyadhara's mastery over elements.
Translator must preserve the systematic presentation of grounds while maintaining the understanding that these are stages of realization.
