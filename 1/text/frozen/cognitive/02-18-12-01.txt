Detailed exposition of three kayas' manifestation through light display progression. Provides roadmap for recognition stabilization markers. Rigpa reaching measure produces appearances as wisdom display. First, within each bindu, half-body appearances manifest—nirmanakaya purification. Then, full individual bodies appear—nirvana appearance from direct perception. Then, these become five fathers and mothers—sambhogakaya wisdom reaching measure. Then, individual circle mandalas become boundary walls and principal retinue—dharmakaya purification. Progression could be read as hierarchical achievement rather than natural manifestation. Body descriptions risk being interpreted as visualizations rather than recognition phenomenology. These appearances arise from preliminary practice's key points reached—body activities not producing future results. These are designated appearances from purification, not produced by causes. Wisdom's naturally existing display, obscurations purified appearing. Natural manifestation, not cause-effect fabrication.

Canonical sealing through Talgyur and Tenbu citations. Establishes authoritative foundation for appearance descriptions. Wisdom reaching measure appearance definitively shows sambhogakaya marks. From uncertain rainbow colors, five families appear as fathers and mothers. Tenbu citation confirms: until reaching body, six and ten and five-three, definitely sambhogakaya. Numerical references require technical knowledge. Without context, citations appear cryptic. Talgyur citation establishes: rigpa reaching measure appearance, sambhogakaya marks clearly shown, from uncertain rainbow colors, five families appearing. Canonical seals confirm phenomenological descriptions are recognition of natural display.

Transition to detailed characteristic exposition with general presentation and particular three measures. Reaching measure's definition distinguishes general and particular to establish framework for recognition stabilization. Essential point throughout: appearances as wisdom display, kayas as natural manifestation, recognition as confirmation of what is already present. King of vehicles' view—direct recognition of natural perfection.
