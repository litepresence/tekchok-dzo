transition frame from general empowerment exposition to specific wisdom-prajñā empowerment detailed analysis. Lineage continuity markers establish textual authority: Vimala to Lhetsün hand lineage—phyag len—maintains unbroken transmission; Guru Jobér treasure lineage—gter ma—acknowledges interruption requiring guru's clarification on blessing bestowal permissibility. Frame serves dual purpose: authenticating teaching source while establishing contemporary application parameters. Anuttara-yoga tantra with completion stage emphasis—practices operating at subtle body level within empowerment context, not separate from it. lineage terminology precision crucial—hand lineage implies direct transmission through practice; treasure lineage implies terma revelation with different authorization structures. distinction between phyag len and gter ma must remain clear; empowerment sequence integrity maintained across lineage interruptions.

wisdom-prajñā empowerment classification introduction establishing seventeen-point analytical framework for mudrā/consort examination. Sequential enumeration creates comprehensive examination methodology: seeking and examining, attracting, channel marks examination, bodhicitta expansion, dhāraṇī training, mantra-path holding, bliss generation method instruction, special seat method, conventional bindu descent, body posture, wind key holding, bindu refinement, bliss sequence application, view application, change calculation, ultimate bodhicitta application, special empowerment certainty, bliss object separation measure, continuous practice guideline, post-empowerment conduct. Anuttara-yoga technical classification system operating within traditional Indian-Buddhist analytical frameworks. seventeenfold structure must remain numerically precise without conflation; technical terms rtsa, rlung, thig le must maintain technical specificity without reduction to generic equivalents like channels, winds, drops. sequential integrity of seventeen points; terminology consistency with broader Nyingma lexical conventions.

[8166-8171]
Frame completion establishing method-result correlation. Wisdom-prajñā empowerment produces attainment of prajñā corresponding to consort's classification level. Fivefold attainment hierarchy mirrors consort typology: royal consort yields full Buddhahood, minister consort yields vajra-holder status, commoner consort yields vidyādhara accomplishment, brahmin consort yields maṇḍala sovereignty, outcaste consort yields siddhi attainment. This establishes functional correspondence between examination rigor and accomplishment level. linking analytical framework to soteriological outcomes. tantric soteriology where method-fruit correspondence operates through symbolic and energetic resonance. hierarchical terminology must not imply value judgments; attainment descriptions must remain technical. fivefold correlation integrity.

[8172-8180]
First examination category—consort type rigs classification through caste-Buddha family correspondence system. Fivefold typology establishes structural homology between social classification and enlightened families: royal corresponds to Tathāgata family, minister to Vajra family, commoner to Jewel family, brahmin to Lotus family, outcaste to Karma family. Necessity principle stated: each practitioner type requires corresponding consort type for accomplishment—forced mismatches produce obstacles rather than attainments. traditional Indian social classification transposed onto tantric maṇḍala structure without hierarchical valuation. caste terminology carries historical baggage requiring careful contextualization; correspondence must not imply caste determines spiritual capacity. fivefold structure integrity; necessity principle clarity.

[8181-8195]
Inner type classification: non-human consort categories expanding beyond human social typology. Yakṣa, god, nāga, Brahma, Indra daughters as five karma family types—each with specific energetic characteristics and practice suitability.
