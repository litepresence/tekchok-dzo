Crucial distinction between momentary recognition (skad cig gi ngos 'dzin) and meditation (sgom pa) in the context of bardo liberation. This is a key Dzogchen technical distinction that determines liberation potential. precise analytical discrimination between recognition states. The presentation divides momentary recognition in half—meditation days comprise the abiding portion. Confusing "momentary recognition" with "brief glimpse" misses the technical sense of instantaneous recognition of own-face. The distinction between recognition pervaded by own-face realization vs. mere abiding without realization must remain absolutely clear.

Extended recognition of the classification: momentary recognition is pervaded by recognition of own-face (rang ngo shes), yet meditation days are not pervaded by realization. Even without realization, one may abide in natural contemplation (cog bzhag) like the end of spontaneous presence. Momentary recognition is not pervaded by meditation—for in the moment of realization, one is liberated into primordial purity. The limits are connected from peak supreme (rtse mo) to final (mtha' ma), yet meditation days not pervaded by momentary recognition are like final delusion—the limit unconnected like the middle. Therefore dividing momentary recognition and meditation days is most crucial.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents one of the most crucial technical distinctions in Dzogchen bardo teachings—the difference between genuine recognition and mere meditative abiding. The recognition required is that liberation depends on recognition (ngo shes), not on meditation (sgom). One can meditate for eons without recognition and remain in samsara; one can recognize for an instant and be liberated. The translator must preserve this distinction with absolute precision—confusing recognition with meditation destroys the entire soteriological framework of Dzogchen. This technical distinction between momentary recognition and meditation days is essential for understanding how liberation occurs in the bardo state.

Recognition is the key to Dzogchen liberation.
Meditation alone cannot lead to liberation without recognition of one's true nature.
