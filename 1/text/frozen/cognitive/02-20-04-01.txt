Fundamental view: awareness in all states—deluded or not, wandering or passed, sleeping or awake—bears no good-bad distinction. Structural function establishes this universality across all conditions without exception. rigpa's immutable nature. When awareness rests unmeditated, during meditation, during wandering, at passing time—none carry evaluative weight. This is not nihilism but recognition that essence does not transform. Appearance-ways show dream-like joy and suffering, yet these are not the essence. "no good-bad distinction" misread as amorality rather than transcendence of evaluation. "Wandering wrongly in suffering when the jewel is lost" requires contextual understanding—suffering is real as appearance, empty as essence. the jewel metaphor stands central. Precious jewel nectar of awareness, lost in beginningless time, causes suffering through wrong wandering. Not found by searching because never truly lost. Self-arisen, realized by self. Rangshar citation establishes canonical authority. The paradox: losing without knowing, finding with joy—yet both moments without distinction in single nature.

Jewel metaphor elaboration for practice. Structural progression moves from external metaphor to internal recognition—coarse to subtle. self-arising within self-awareness nature. Though lost within self-awareness, found from its own nature. Within single mandala of self-awareness, no going elsewhere. King's treasury metaphor: jewel lost in treasury causes suffering; found causes joy—yet both remain in same treasury unmoved. Samsara and nirvana appearing from awareness nature follow similar pattern. treasury metaphor read as psychological rather than ontological. Single mandala interpreted as solipsism rather than non-dual recognition. this is secret word of supreme wish-fulfilling self-nature determining vast expanse of dharma-nature. Awareness never moves, never changes, yet appears to wander and return. Recognition that wandering and returning are same unmoved nature constitutes the view.

Transition from view to practice through lamp placement preparation. Threefold division: retreat characteristics, lamp placement method, appearance arising. lamp placement as direct continuation of view recognition. Prerequisites: abandoning this-life activities, pleasing authentic guru, dwelling in secluded place with three unmoving aspects, completing guru yoga. Talgyur citation establishes method: faithful one abandoning samsara mind, making offerings, abandoning samsara connections, dwelling alone in secluded place. "abandoning this-life activities" invites extreme interpretation. Tibetan context emphasizes mental non-attachment rather than physical renunciation alone. retreat characteristics establish optimal conditions—darkness-surrounded room, three unmoving aspects, guru yoga completion. These serve as supports for recognition, not requirements. Lamp placement has two aspects: placing on letter a, and entering into clarity. Essential point: view and practice remain continuous, not sequential.
