Path-appearance (lam snang) presentation opening with architectural metaphor—treasury of spontaneous presence's primordial purity as meaningful fruition like a house. The recognition required is that "path" in Dzogchen is not progressive but performative: one "enters" primordial purity and "emerges" as spontaneous display. The house metaphor establishes containment and emergence structure. Dzogchen non-gradual path, recognition-based rather than developmental. Rendering "lam" as "path" suggests progressive journey—Dzogchen path is immediate recognition, not sequential traversing. The entering-emerging structure must not sound temporal.

Twofold path-appearance typology: path of self-accomplishment preceding fruition, and path of guiding disciples after accomplishment. This is the bodhisattva model applied to Dzogchen fruition: first one's own recognition, then manifestation for others. Register: Mahayana bodhisattva path reframed in Dzogchen terms. Risk: The "before-after" structure appears temporal unless recognized as logical not chronological priority. The non-contradictory relationship between path-appearance and fruition—two aspects of one thing, not sequential stages.

[16372-16401]
Extended analysis of three-kāya manifestation from inner expanse to external display. The subtle point: liberated dharmakaya's three kayas manifesting externally as path from inner expanse. This is the crucial Dzogchen doctrine: kayas are not created but disclosed. The citation from Senghe Tsal Dzogchen establishes authority for the "similar yet different" (dra gnyis) distinction—vajrasattva's dharmata and self-appearance mandala are similar in essence but differ in appearance to disciples. Register: Dzogchen subtle distinction requiring high intelligence. Risk: The "dra gnyis shan phyed" (distinguishing the two similars) is among the most subtle Dzogchen points—easy to misread as contradiction rather than paradox.

[16402-16408]
Transition to three locations presentation—general and specific explanations of three-kāya abodes. shifting from path-appearance theory to three-kāya architecture. The section break indicates move from philosophical analysis to systematic enumeration. Register: Abhidharma-style systematic presentation. Risk: The shift appears abrupt without recognizing it as application of path-appearance theory to specific three-kāya locations. The continuity between theoretical framework and specific application must remain visible.

[16360-16408]
Overall structural recognition: This section presents the Dzogchen theory of path-appearance—how enlightenment manifests without departing from primordial purity. The core paradox: buddhahood is already complete (ka dag) yet spontaneously displays (lhun grub) for beings' benefit. The "two similars" distinction is crucial: inner self-appearance (rang snang) and what disciples perceive are essentially the same rigpa-display, but appear differently according to capacity. This is not two different things but one thing appearing differently. The translator must preserve both the logical rigor of the analysis and the recognition that the "path" being described is not a path to somewhere but the nature of what is already complete.
