This section establishes the tenth through twelfth stages of the Dzogchen path, distinguishing them from common Mahāyāna bodhisattva grounds. The tenth stage, comparable to the Dharma Cloud, represents the duration where individuals who have seen truth do not abandon this very nucleus. For those who have abandoned the nucleus, the progression continues: when deluded appearance ceases and appears as pure appearance mass, this is the eleventh stage, All-Pervading Light. When without attachment to that appearance, unstained by all external and internal phenomena, this is the twelfth stage, Unstained Lotus-Bearer. The structural function is to present a Dzogchen-specific stage theory that maps onto but fundamentally reinterprets common Buddhist stage structure. The preservation requirement is to maintain the technical specificity of these stages as recognition-stages rather than accumulation-stages.

[5934-5943]
The thirteenth through sixteenth stages continue the progression: when from one's own heart center wisdom light-rays shine forth and in the sky five light-masses appear as wheel mandala, this is the thirteenth stage, Great Wheel Assembly of Letters. When resting in wisdom-appearance, this is the fourteenth stage, Great Samādhi. When spontaneously present stage is certainly attained, this is the fifteenth stage, attainment of Vajra-Holder Stage. When in originally pure stage pristine awareness freely dawns and above that nothing else exists, this is the sixteenth stage, attainment of Wisdom Teacher Stage. The key distinction follows: these are correspondences of appearance-method, not the actual bodhisattva ten stages themselves. The preservation concern involves maintaining the Dzogchen view that these stages are expressions of single awareness rather than sequential achievements.

The section establishes that these stages are merely different aspects of the single stage of primordial awareness-clear light, without training or traversing. Actually, there is only the stage of awareness. For attainment of Buddha Vajra-Dhara, there is no need for separate causal stages. The structural insight is that different entry-points to the path produce this kind of correspondence, but common cause-effect sequences do not apply. The stages of external and internal mantra, generation and completion, effort and accomplishment, are not traversed or trained in. The verse citations establish the view: sems can bsam gyis mi khyab pa yod kyang ye shes kyi ngo bo gcig las med do; sa dang lam zhes bya ba gud na yod pa ma yin no; sa dang lam la sbyang zhing bgrod mi dgos pa yin par shes par bya'o. The preservation requirement is to maintain the radical Dzogchen view that stages are spontaneous expressions rather than gradual achievements.

The conclusion establishes this teaching as the eighteenth chapter-section of the Jewel Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle. Having presented the actual path, now the path's distinction is presented: for those with superior faculties, the method of liberation without meditation—Khregschod instruction—is established definitively through three aspects: introducing face-to-face directly, cutting decision directly to bind the fetter, and cutting through confidence-liberation to clear the ravine. The first has three aspects: establishing the nature of Great Perfection beyond acceptance, rejection, and effort—like space, originally pure spontaneous presence, as the essential nature. The structural function is to transition from general path presentation to specific instruction on the highest practice. The preservation concern involves maintaining the technical specificity of khregs chod as a distinct Dzogchen practice rather than general meditation instruction.
