Structural function: Thögal (thod rgal) practical technique presentation—thumb-finger pressing method. Sitting cross-legged, pressing thumb and finger on red-clear light-appearance, taking as experience. Sessions short, many in number. Release effort, look slowly—seeing appearance by pressing again called dharmatā directly manifest appearance. View register: Dzogchen Thögal direct introduction technique. Translation risk: Literalizing the physical instructions misses their function as supports for recognition, not mechanical techniques. Preservation: The gentle, natural quality of the practice must remain clear.

Extended recognition of the five-light progression described: first like smoke, dull illusion, hovering clouds, fire sparks, sun and moon, star forms, intermediate-space rainbow, white clear light. These are not external phenomena but natural manifestations of rigpa's luminosity. The progression from coarse to subtle establishes increasing refinement of clarity as obscurations dissolve.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents a specific Thögal technique for generating visionary appearances. The recognition required is that the physical technique (thumb-finger pressing) is a support for recognition, not a mechanical means of producing visions. The translator must preserve the practical precision of the instructions while maintaining the understanding that these are natural processes, not forced visualizations.
