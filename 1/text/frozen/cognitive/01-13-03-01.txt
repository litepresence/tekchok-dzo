[Structural Synthesis: Complete Bindu Empty Lamp Framework]
This section (16483-16768) presents the complete framework of the bindu empty lamp—one of the four lamps in Thögal practice. The architecture moves from definition through classification to characteristics, locations, doors, and natures. The view throughout is that the bindu is simultaneously empty and luminous, the place where all phenomena are trusted to mind, and the basis for both samsara and nirvana. The translator must preserve the technical terminology—thig le (bindu), sgron ma (lamp), stong pa (empty)—while conveying that this describes actual visionary experience, not philosophical abstraction. The five colors, five locations, six doors, and seven natures provide a comprehensive map of the bindu experience, serving as reference points for practitioners. This is advanced Dzogchen material requiring experiential familiarity to fully appreciate.
