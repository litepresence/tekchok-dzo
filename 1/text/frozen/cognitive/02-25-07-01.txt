[16972-17330]
Overall structural recognition: This is the final chapter of the Treasury, the twenty-fifth story of the twenty-five-story palace. The architectonic completion of the entire work happens here through systematic presentation of Buddha's fivefold attributes—Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities. The recognition required is that this is not merely a summary but the crowning exposition that makes explicit what has been implicit throughout: the full manifestation of enlightenment as basis, path, and fruition. The definitional formula applied across all five attributes establishes a consistent heuristic: essence (ngo bo), definitive terminology (nges tshig), and divisions (dbye ba). This is Longchenpa's signature analytical style—rigorous categorization serving non-dual recognition. The translator must preserve this tension between enumerative precision and emptiness of inherent existence. The colophon material that extends through line 17330 performs multiple closure functions simultaneously: textual completion, merit dedication, protective entrustment, and lineage transmission. Each of these functions operates on different temporal and metaphysical registers, and the cognitive layer must recognize all of them without collapsing their distinctions. The three-kāya framework that organizes the entire presentation must remain clearly visible throughout the translation process, as it is the architectural spine of this concluding chapter.

[16972-16975]
Structural function: Opening definition of kāya establishing Buddha-ground as unchanging basis. The text names its own subject matter through definitional formula—ngo bo, nges tshig, dbye ba—the threefold presentation standard. View register: Sambhogakāya and dharmakāya distinction emerging, pure realm cosmology. Translation risk: Rendering sku as "body" reifies what the text explicitly de-reifies through "changing-unchanging" polarity. Preservation: The nges tshig as "lus su rdzogs pa" must not become anatomical—this is functional completion, not physical form.

[16976-16982]
Citation from Jewel Lamp Sūtra serves dual purpose: scriptural authority and definitional clarity. The polemical edge is subtle but present—referencing Khotsema against potential charges of innovation. Structural transition from definition to proof. Register shifts to citation-formula, standard scholastic device. Risk: Over-translating the citation markers destroys the conversational rhythm. Preservation: The "ltar" construction establishing textual lineage must remain audible.

[16983-17002]
Three-kāya architecture presented through characteristic-mark distinction. The pattern is: essence-definition, mark-absence, function-implication. Dharmakāya: free from elaboration (spros bral) marking ultimate register. Sambhogakāya: free from marks (mtshan ma dang bral ba) marking subtle-body register. Emanation-kāya: free from determination (nges pa dang bral ba) marking conventional register. Translation risk: Collapsing the three "bral ba" distinctions into generic "free from" misses the progressive refinement. Preservation: The threefold structure mirrors Guhyagarbha architecture—this resonance must not be smoothed.

[17003-17026]
Speech presentation mirrors kāya structure exactly—same threefold definitional formula applied to gsung. This is architectural consistency, not redundancy. The sixfold division of speech requires careful tracking: great deeds, Brahma's, six migrations', beings' faith, symbolic, word. Each operates at different pedagogical levels. Register shifts between tantric citation and systematic enumeration. Risk: The sixfold classification appears arbitrary without recognizing sambhogakāya-nirmāṇakāya interface. Preservation: The hierarchical relationship—emanation-kāya as basis for all appearing speech—must not be lost in the enumeration.

[17027-17046]
Mind presentation completes the three-kāya triad of Body-Speech-Mind. The thugs triad mirrors the structure: complete abandonment, complete realization, complete deeds. Awareness-wisdom (ye shes) distinguished from ordinary mind (sems). Register: Dzogchen-rigpa terminology emerging in "rang sa na gsal ba." Risk: Translating rig pa as "awareness" loses the specific Dzogchen valence. Preservation: The threefold ye shes structure—dran pa sangs pa, 'gyur med rdo rje, mkhyen pa sna tshogs—represents recognition, stability, and manifestation phases.

[17047-17070]
Qualities presentation shifts the architectural register. No longer triadic but focusing on spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as jewel-like perfection. The ground-path-fruition structure applies qualities temporally while asserting atemporal spontaneity. This is the Dzogchen synthesis: sequential presentation of what is inherently complete. Register shifts to nor bu jewel metaphor. Risk: Treating ground/path/fruition as stages contradicts the text's own lhun grub assertion. Preservation: The tension between presentation-structure and asserted-nature must remain available to the reader.

[17071-17110]
Activities presentation as final member of fivefold Buddha-attributes. The fourfold activity typology—pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, wrathful—represents standard tantric classification. Synthesis of Ornament of Realization citation with spontaneous engagement formula. Register: classic sādhana presentation. Risk: The four activities formula is so familiar it becomes invisible—reader misses the "lhun gyis grub pa" as non-causal spontaneity. Preservation: The moon-in-water simile for effortless activity must retain its epistemic force.

[17111-17250]
Extensive colophon material establishing textual completion and dedicatory merit. The architectural metaphor of twenty-five-story palace (rim khang nyer lnga) returns to frame the entire work. Structural function: closure through return to opening imagery. Register shifts to pure land aspiration. The dedicatory verses operate on multiple levels—immediate completion celebration, future lineage transmission, and ultimate emptiness dedication. Risk: Reading these as mere "flourishes" misses their functional role in sealing the teaching. Preservation: The twenty-five-story architecture explicitly named—this is the text's own meta-structure and must be preserved in translation awareness.

[17251-17330]
Final dedication and protective entrustment. The text names itself—Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod—establishing self-referential closure. Entrustment to protectors and dakinis serves both practical (preservation) and metaphysical (blessing) functions. The dge'o thrice repeated marks liturgical conclusion. Final Sanskrit formula returns to Indic source. Register: terma-style sealing. Risk: Translating the protective verses as "may it be preserved" loses the active entrustment to dharmapālas. Preservation: The three dge'o as sonic seal of completion must remain audible as such.

[16972-17010]
Extended recognition of the definitional architecture across body, speech, and mind presentations. Each follows identical grammatical scaffolding: essence (ngo bo), definitive terminology (nges tshig), divisions (dbye ba). This is not repetitive filler but systematic application of a heuristic framework. The recognition here is that Longchenpa treats Buddha-attributes as analysable without becoming reified. The three-kāya structure appears in each domain—body as dharmakāya/sambhogakāya/nirmāṇakāya, speech through sixfold classification mapping to the three, mind as three wisdom-awarenesses. The structural risk is overwhelming the reader with enumeration while the doctrinal point is non-enumerability. The translator must preserve both: the enumerative presentation as upāya, the non-dual essence as truth.

[17011-17050]
Recognition of the citation strategy in the speech section. The Perfect Power (rtsal rdzogs) tantra is cited twice: first for the definitional formula, then for the sixfold division. This is not redundancy but pedagogical layering. The Sublime Continuum (rgyud bla ma) citation on echo-like speech serves a specific polemical function—it establishes Buddha-speech as non-originated, countering potential charges of authorship. The echo metaphor is precise: sound appears to arise from the echo but actually arises from the original sound source. Similarly, Buddha-speech appears to arise from Buddha but actually arises from the disciple's cognition meeting blessing. This is Madhyamaka-level emptiness applied to sambhogakāya function. Risk of translation: domesticating the echo metaphor into something more "natural" loses the epistemological precision.

[17051-17090]
Recognition of the mind-section's placement after body and speech. The triad Body-Speech-Mind follows standard Buddhist anthropology but with Dzogchen inflection. Where ordinary mind (sems) would be the expected category, here we have ye shes—wisdom-awareness. This is the crucial shift from Sutric to Dzogchen register. The threefold ye shes structure maps to the three kāyas: dharmakāya as dran pa sangs pa (mindfulness ceased), sambhogakāya as 'gyur med rdo rje (unchanging vajra), nirmāṇakāya as mkhyen pa sna tshogs (various knowing). The recognition required here is that these are not developmental stages but simultaneous aspects. The translator must not sequence them temporally.

[17091-17130]
Recognition of qualities and activities as functional rather than substantial attributes. The nor bu (jewel) metaphor for qualities establishes spontaneous presence—qualities not acquired but naturally manifesting. The ground-path-fruition division of qualities appears sequential but is actually perspectival: from the basis, qualities are chos sku rang sa zin pa (self-abiding dharmakāya); from the path, they manifest as longs sku 'khar la gsal ba (vase-clear sambhogakāya); at fruition, they conduct as sprul sku 'gro ba 'dren pa (emanation-kāya guiding beings). This is not temporal unfolding but three ways of recognizing what is always already complete. The four activities (zhis rgyas dbang drag) similarly are not things Buddha does but ways Buddha-activity appears to different recipients.

[17131-17170]
Recognition of the architectural closure in the colophon material. The text explicitly names its own structure: rim khang nyer lnga pa—the twenty-fifth story. This is the final chapter completing the twenty-five-fold presentation of the Treasury. The metaphor of the palace (khang bzangs) with its twenty-five stories woven throughout (rim khang lnga phrag lngas brgyan pa) is not decorative but structural. The recognition here is that the entire text is architecturally self-aware. The dedicatory verses that follow (extending through line 17250) operate on multiple temporal registers: celebrating completion in the immediate present, dedicating merit to future recipients, and sealing the teaching in timeless emptiness. The translator must preserve these temporal layers without collapsing them into simple "past-present-future."

[17171-17210]
Recognition of the protective entrustment (gtad pa) function in the closing verses. This is standard terma literature structure: completion, dedication, entrustment to protectors, and sealing. The entrustment to dpal ldan sngags kyi bdag mo (Glorious Mantra Mistress), rāhu la, and rdo rje legs pa is not merely "asking for protection" but activating the dharmapāla function—establishing the text as terma requiring guardian stewardship. The risk of translation is making this sound like superstitious petition rather than functional activation of the text's protective dimension. The recognition required is that these verses perform an action: they entrust, not merely request.

[17211-17250]
Recognition of the merit-dedication architecture. The verses follow the standard four-immeasurables pattern extended to pure land aspiration. The phrasing "dpag med chos kyi mdzod 'di" (this immeasurable Dharma treasury) explicitly names the text as chos mdzod—Dharma treasury—echoing the title rin po che'i mdzod (jewel treasury). This is self-referential closure: the text names itself as complete. The dedicatory recipients expand outward: from immediate circle to all beings to pure land aspiration. The final verses seal with the aspiration that the teaching remain and flourish. This is not mere well-wishing but establishment of the text's continuity in time.

[17251-17290]
Recognition of the final structural elements. The threefold dge'o (auspiciousness) functions as sonic seal—auditory punctuation of completion. The Sanskrit formula that follows is the standard ye dharma hetu prabhava mantra, serving as universal Buddhist closure. The text then names itself one final time: Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod ces bya ba—the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle, so named. This is the full title with its author—Kun mkhyen ngag gi dbang pos mdzad pa—accomplished by Omniscient Lord of Speech. The recognition required is that these are not mere formalities but the text's establishment of its own identity, authority, and completion.

[17291-17330]
Final recognition of the completion-state. The text ends with the Sanskrit blessing formula, returning to the Indic source. The structural journey is complete: from homage opening to dedication closing, from Sanskrit title to Sanskrit seal. The translator's recognition here is of the work as complete architectural entity—each element positioned functionally, each citation serving validation, each definitional formula establishing analytical precision. The preservation requirement is total: nothing in this closing material is decorative; everything performs closure-function. The cognitive layer documents this completion-awareness: the recognition that the text knows itself as finished, sealed, and entrusted.
