Structural function: Establishes the chapter's organizing principle through seven excellences that distinguish this vehicle from common paths. The opening frame introduces the "secret great display of the good path of rigpa's self-appearance" as the topic, immediately signaling a Dzogchen view context. The seven excellences function not as hierarchical claims but as pedagogical distinctions pointing to recognition beyond effort-based attainment.

View register: Recognition operates independently of faculty sharpness or dullness. Unlike gradual paths where superior intellect accelerates realization while dull faculties impede it, this approach establishes that recognition manifests equally regardless of effort intensity. The faculties do not transform—recognition simply occurs.

Translation risk: "Superior" (khyad par 'phags) risks sectarian interpretation. The Tibetan emphasizes functional distinction rather than ontological hierarchy. The phrase "not depending on conceptual assessment" (yid dpyod la mi ltos pa) is critical—preserving the non-conceptual nature of recognition prevents reading this as philosophy rather than direct perception.

Preservation: The seven excellences form a complete framework: (1) faculties without sharp-dull distinction, (2) no dependence on conceptual assessment, (3) single-syllable recognition of meaning, (4) no dependence on intellectually fabricated ground-path-result, (5) no dependence on karmic cause-effect, (6) no age distinction for youth-elder, (7) three kayas as path-appearances. These are not additive achievements but simultaneous recognition aspects.

[3942-3978]
Structural function: Situates this teaching within Dzogchen's own typology by comparing with Atiyoga's three divisions—Mind, Space, and Instruction. The dialectical structure responds to potential objection: if this is Atiyoga, how does it exceed Ati? The answer distinguishes recognition depth rather than claiming sectarian superiority.

View register: Even within Atiyoga, limitations exist. Mind Division establishes confidence in the unfabricated ground but remains at conceptual assessment. Instruction Division with its three cycles of outer, inner, and secret focuses on intermediate state timing. This teaching contains the excellence of light-body liberation, distinguishing it functionally without hierarchy.

Translation risk: The jewel-lamp simile (3972-3977) requires careful handling. The citation from Pramanaviniscaya establishes that although wrong awareness and jewel-light-perceiving awareness are equally "awareness," they differ functionally in accomplishing purpose. This is not about "better awareness" but about recognition's efficacy.

Preservation: The three Atiyoga divisions each have specific orientations: Mind Division toward vast ground-free confidence, Space Division toward unfabricated spontaneity, Instruction Division toward intermediate state timing. This teaching transcends these limitations through direct light-body recognition, not by negating them but by including their scope within immediate perception.

[3979-3993]
Structural function: Canonical seal through Talgyur citation encapsulating the seven excellences in verse form. The structural movement from prose exposition to canonical citation provides authoritative closure to the superiority presentation.

View register: Primordial purity recognized through direct perception (chos nyid mngon sum). The verse emphasizes that wisdom sees through faculties, not through intellect—preserving the non-conceptual core. Common vehicles fail to accomplish meaning not through deficiency but through depending on words and concepts rather than direct recognition.

Translation risk: "Three kayas as path-appearances" (sku gsum lam snang) is easily misconstrued as achieving kayas through path practice rather than recognizing kayas as intrinsic display. "Not reversing the three realms" (khams gsum ldog pa min) requires context—this refers to non-rejection, not non-transformation.

Preservation: The verse structure mirrors the seven excellences: direct perception of dharma-nature, no good-evil in karma, Heart Essence definitive summary, faculties without dull-sharp, conceptual thought and words ended, wisdom not intellect, words do not see dharma-nature, common vehicles do not accomplish meaning, three kayas as path-appearances. This encapsulation serves as mnemonic and transmission vehicle.

[3994-4021]
Structural function: Transitions from theoretical superiority to practical prerequisites—empowerment and samaya. The structural division into ripening empowerment and liberating instruction establishes the two-phase pedagogical model. This section covers empowerment, leaving samaya for subsequent lines.

View register: Empowerment as ripening (smin pa), not conferring what is absent. The four empowerments transform body, speech, and mind into their natural states through recognition, not fabrication. Outer empowerment with elaboration: body transforms into deity body through mandala and vase support. Inner without elaboration: speech transforms through the unexpressed meaning of the syllable A. Secret: mind arrives at its own nature. Most secret: all three transformed simultaneously through posture and gaze.

Translation risk: Standard tantric terminology (empowerment, vase, mandala) risks interpretation through lower vehicle frameworks. The phrase "obtaining power over body" (lus...dbang thob pa) could imply acquisition rather than recognition. Preservation requires emphasizing that these are supports for recognition, not constructions.

Preservation: The four empowerments have distinct effects: body as deity body, outer container as palace; speech as deity recitation, inner inexpressible meaning experienced; mind arrives at entity nature, experiences clear-light meaning; posture liberates into three kaya postures, speech-cutting liberates sound power, mind blessing stimulates clear-light. These are descriptions of natural state, not achievements.

[4022-4057]
Structural function: Detailed exposition of empowerment effects and the necessity of samaya as supporting condition. The structural movement from empowerment effects to samaya establishes dependency—ripening requires maintenance through observance.

View register: Ripening of body, speech, and mind corresponds to generation stage, uncommon power, and completion stage signs. When all three ripenings complete, the direct perception path of dharma-nature fully manifests. Samaya as root of accomplishment—pleasing the guru generates all siddhis. This is not transactional but recognition-based: the guru represents the nature of mind, so devotion to guru stabilizes recognition of nature.

Translation risk: "Pleasing the guru" (bla ma mnyes pa) carries risk of cultic interpretation. The Tibetan context emphasizes recognizing the guru as manifestation of awareness, not personality worship. Physical, verbal, and mental service each have specific modes—not arbitrary devotion but recognition-supporting practice.

Preservation: Samaya has three gates: body through respectful service (rising, mandala offering, washing feet, anointing, gazing homage, seeing homage), speech through focusing on qualities not faults, mind through emulating activity and generating faith in others. The canonical citations from Damtsig Chenpo and Drwa Ba Sengden establish the authoritative foundation. The key principle: never transgressing the guru's mind-intention.

[4058-4080]
Structural function: Transition from samaya to instruction proper. The structural formula "having ripened, liberating" (smin pa grol ba) establishes the sequence—empowerment and samaya prepare the vessel, instruction pours the contents. The threefold instruction typology (khrid, ngo sprod, tsang sprugs) maps to trekcho, thogal, and intermediate state teachings.

View register: Instruction as direct pointing, not explanation. The three types—guidance system, direct introduction, and challenging the guest—represent different pedagogical approaches to the same recognition. Trekcho as direct introduction hitting all-at-once; thogal as challenging completion; intermediate state instruction as guiding through transition.

Translation risk: Instruction terminology (gdams ngag) risks interpretation as information transfer. The phrase "cutting through" (khregs chod) and "direct leap" (thod rgal) require preservation as technical terms with specific phenomenological referents, not merely poetic language.

Preservation: The three instruction types have distinct applications: guidance system for systematic practitioners, direct introduction for those with sharp faculties, challenging completion for intermediate state preparation. All three serve the same function—triggering recognition of what is already the case. The structural inclusion here anticipates detailed exposition in subsequent sections.

[4081-4093]
Structural function: Preliminary practice section opening—establishing the necessity and nature of preliminary practices. The structural question-answer format (what precedes, how it precedes, simile, purpose, classification) provides comprehensive coverage.

View register: Preliminaries as "clearing fears"—like investigating dangerous terrain before travel, preliminary practice removes obstacles to main practice. The essential point: without preliminaries, main practice recognition cannot stabilize; without main practice, preliminary practice produces no result. They function as mutual supports.

Translation risk: Preliminary practice risks being dismissed as "lesser" or "preparatory" in a hierarchical sense. The Tibetan emphasizes functional necessity rather than temporal sequence. The metaphor of king's summons or horse saddling indicates inevitability and preparation, not subordination.

Preservation: Preliminary practice has five aspects: what precedes (transcending worldly mind), how it precedes (purifying body-speech-mind of accumulated obscurations), simile (unavoidable preparation), purpose (easy main practice, confidence, no obstacles), classification (three introductions—kaya, rigpa, mind). The male-female agricultural partnership simile establishes that both are necessary, neither sufficient alone.

[4094-4120]
Structural function: Detailed preliminary practice exposition—the three introductions. The structural organization follows the classification: body introduction through element yoga, rigpa introduction through samsara-nirvana distinction conduct, mind introduction through body-speech-mind nature practice.

View register: The three introductions progressively refine recognition: body through element sound training establishes pure perception of environment; rigpa through distinction conduct separates samsara from nirvahana recognition; mind through body-speech-mind nature stabilizes recognition of natural state.

Translation risk: "Element yoga" ('byung ba'i rnam 'byor) risks confusion with Hindu yoga or other Buddhist element practices. The specific reference is to training in the sounds of earth, water, fire, wind—the four elements' qualities as support for recognition.

Preservation: Body introduction: training in four element sounds with emphasis on earth, water, fire, wind. Rigpa introduction: distinction conduct separating samsara from nirvana—without this distinction, body-speech-mind cannot connect to meaning. Mind introduction: training in body-speech-mind nature. Canonical citations from Talgyur and Gyutrul establish lineage continuity.

[4121-4155]
Structural function: View section detailed exposition—stillness, movement, and awareness as dharmakāya. The structural progression from conduct to view follows the standard sequence, but here with emphasis on recognition rather than cultivation.

View register: Ordinary mind (tha mal gyi shes pa) as technical term for rigpa in natural state. Stillness without thought, movement with thought, and naked awareness—each recognized as dharmakāya establishes non-dual view. This is not intellectual understanding but direct recognition.

Translation risk: "Ordinary mind" risks confusion with conventional consciousness. The Tibetan specifies unmodified, unfabricated awareness—not the ordinary mind of delusion but the ordinary nature of awareness. "Dhramakaya" here refers to nature, not achievement.

Preservation: The three aspects—stillness, movement, awareness—each have dharmakāya nature. Stillness: no thought, empty essence. Movement: with thought, clear nature. Awareness: knowing, unobstructed compassion. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of recognition. The threefold structure serves as recognition support, not graduated path.
