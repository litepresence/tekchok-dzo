Heart wheel (snying gi 'khor lo) enumeration: eight root lotus (rtsa padma brgyad) divided into thirty-two branch-petals ('dab so gsum bcu rtsa gnyis) with numberless sub-channels (rtsa phra grangs med). Detailed anatomy of heart chakra. View register: heart as central hub. Dharma wheel channels (chos kyi 'khor lo'i rtsa) thirty-two (so gsum bcu rtsa gnyis) great petals ('dab chen), small thousand nine-hundred dwelling (chung stong dgu brgya gnas pa), gathering channels (bsdud pa'i rtsa) four (bzhi), twenty-eight end (nyer brgyad mtha').

Complete channel enumeration. View register: comprehensive anatomy. Risk: numerical precision critical—preserve exact counts. View register: numbers carry meaning. Channel movements (rtsa 'gros): ten karma wind (las kyi rlung bcu), day one twenty thousand aspects moving (nyin gcig khri gnyis stong rnam 'gyu). Remainder six-hundred wisdom wind (lhag drug brgya ye shes kyi rlung), instant each parts (skad cig re re'i cha), movement thirty-two ('gros so gsum bcu rtsa gnyis). Wind movements through channels. View register: dynamic energetics. Person day each (mi nyin re re), instants ten-thousand four-thousand (skad cig khri bzhi stong), wind also that much (rlung de snyed). Daily wind movements. View register: quantification of subtle processes. Outer channel branch-petals (phyi rtsa 'dab): dharma wheel location manner (chos 'khor gnas tshul)—flower like channel (me tog 'dra ba'i rtsa), very subtle channel aspects five five divided (phra mo'i rtsa rnam pa lnga lngar dbye), stake like channel (phur pa lta bu'i rtsa). Symbolic channel descriptions. View register: visualization supports. Risk: anatomical metaphor describes energy patterns—preserve as visualization correspondences. View register: energetic, not physical anatomy. Vital-point specific (gnad kyi khyad par): dharma wheel thirty-two (chos 'khor so gsum bcu rtsa gnyis), channel form those and wind form those (rtsa gzugs de dang rlung gzugs de). Able-to-squeeze channel five ('gag nus kyi rtsa lnga), able-to-hold wind five ('dzin nus kyi rlung lnga), able-to-insert channel five ('jug nus kyi rtsa lnga), able-to-reverse wind five (log nus kyi rlung lnga), able-to-circle channel two ('khyil nus kyi rtsa gnyis), able-to-hold wind two ('dzin nus kyi rlung gnyis), draw drop two (thig 'gugs gnyis).

Hand wrist right hollow (lag phrag g.yas sbubs), letter KA entry located (yi ge KA 'jug gnas). Bloodletting points (gto gnad): left hollow KHA (g.yon sbubs KHA), right GA (g.yas GA), left GHA (g.yon GHA), arm inside NA (dpung nang NA), right corner channel (g.yas zur gyi rtsa), Ru Thung inside TSA (ru thung nang TSA), arm bile corner DZA (dpung mkhris zur DZA), left DZA (g.yon DZA), elbow back center TA (gru mo rgyab dbus TA). Detailed therapeutic instructions. View register: traditional medicine. Risk: therapeutic protocols represent period medical theory—preserve without modernization. View register: historical medical context.

This section (14528-14814) presents the complete anatomy and therapeutic framework of the heart wheel (snying gi 'khor lo). The architecture moves from channel enumeration through wind movements to therapeutic application. The view throughout is that the heart chakra is the central hub of the subtle body, with complex channel systems and therapeutic applications. The translator must preserve the numerical precision and technical terminology while acknowledging this is traditional Tibetan medical theory, not modern anatomy. The heart wheel connects the upper and lower chakras, making it crucial for the circulation of subtle energies. The therapeutic applications require authentic transmission and should be preserved as cultural and historical knowledge.

The heart wheel is the central chakra of the subtle body system, containing the most extensive channel network. With eight root petals dividing into thirty-two branches and countless sub-channels, it serves as the energetic hub of the body. The thirty-two great petals of the dharma wheel correspond to specific wisdom aspects. Various channel types—awareness, body, light, wisdom, bindu—each have specific functions and locations. The five bindu channels distribute essence throughout the system. Daily wind movements number in the tens of thousands, carrying consciousness through the channels. Therapeutic applications use specific channels for bloodletting and energetic manipulation. The numerical precision is essential for practice and preservation. Translator must maintain exact counts and classifications while understanding these describe energetic patterns, not physical anatomy.
