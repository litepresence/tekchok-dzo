Structural function: Abhidharma exposition of three gates: aggregates (phung po), sense-bases (skye mched), elements (khams). Three realms explained through consciousness origination—form realm with spatial distinctions above-below, desire realm with five objects, afflictions arising from alaya as all-seed mind. Eight consciousnesses with various concepts. Formless realm fourfold: infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothing-at-all, neither perception nor non-perception. Each arising from previous as gathering and aspect. View register: Abhidharma systematic analysis of existence.

[1582-1660]
Extended recognition of the three realm analysis. Dharmakāya level: five wisdoms as spontaneously arisen clear light, awareness-emptiness inseparable. Sambhogakāya level: five families as appearance aspects, buddha field enjoyments, self-awareness object non-dual. Nirmāṇakāya level: six sense-bases as various concepts, object-subject grasping, habit beings. Samsara arising from self-awareness aspect clear, from alaya mind only six consciousnesses. Recognition: The three levels correspond to the Three Kayas, with samsara emerging from failure to recognize.

Six consciousnesses enumeration: eye consciousness holding name and color (ming gzugs), ear accomplishing grasping, nose grasping others, tongue experiencing objects, body consciousness gathering all objects, mind consciousness pervading all existent and non-existent. Each with specific function in perception process. Standard Abhidharma analysis of the perceptual process through six consciousnesses.

[1582-1660]
Two types of aggregates: worldly ('jig rten pa) and transcendent ('jig rten las 'das pa). Worldly: form, feeling, recognition, formation, consciousness—grasped, afflictive. Transcendent: thought-free aggregates abiding in self-knowing aspect of aryas beyond world. Samatha-vipasyana nature as samādhi aggregate. Liberated from own afflictions as wisdom aggregate. Seeing own-common nature as discerning aggregate. Ethics aggregate for purifying stains. Liberation aggregate beyond conceptualization. Path-related qualities transforming ordinary aggregates into transcendent.

[1582-1660]
Sense-bases exposition: what arises and expands from what. Six objects like form for eye. Twelve sense-bases: six internal, six external. Arising and expanding from mutual dependence—not sequential but simultaneous dependent origination. Eye sense-base arises from form, form from eye, consciousness from both. Dharmadhātu as basis of all. Five elements as support: earth-solid, water-moist, fire-hot, wind-moving, space-accommodating. Not analysis into parts but recognition of interdependence.

[1582-1660]
Detailed faculty analysis: sense faculties and wisdom faculties. Eleven form faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, plus five subtle sense faculties and life faculty. Five faculties of those who are learning: faith, effort, mindfulness, samādhi, wisdom. Five faculties of those who are not learning: faith through wisdom similarly. Abhidharma classification system preserves technical terminology without reduction to psychology.

Overall structural recognition: This extensive section presents the complete Abhidharma analysis of aggregates, sense-bases, elements, and faculties. The recognition required is that this systematic analysis provides the foundation for understanding selflessness and the path to liberation. The translator must preserve the technical precision of Abhidharma terminology while maintaining the understanding that these are analytical categories, not ontological substances.

The Abhidharma framework provides the foundation for all subsequent Buddhist philosophical analysis.
Understanding aggregates, sense-bases, and elements is essential for recognizing selflessness.
The three realm analysis demonstrates how existence manifests at different levels of subtlety.
Translator must preserve technical terminology while making the systematic analysis accessible.
