The section on awareness reaching measure opens with precise definition. Rigpa reaching measure indicates the ground-abiding awareness becoming fully manifest, having entered the stream of the path. From the ground appearance's self-resonance, the spontaneous presence door opens, manifesting as body appearance. As path appearance nears exhaustion, mandalas become complete. The structural function establishes the transition from ground to path to fruition, showing how recognition matures through stages without the recognition itself changing. Measure spans from half-body appearance through complete body mandala manifestation. Arrival means appearing without remainder beyond that stage. The full moon simile illustrates how increase and decrease both serve completion—whether waxing or waning, the moon remains complete in itself.

[5281-5300]
The three measures are presented in detail: external appearance measure, internal body measure, and secret awareness measure. The external appearance measure involves control over appearances as fields become light, with pure lands completing as luminosity. The Thalgyur citation provides authoritative support: direct objects cease appearing as solid, earth and stone appearances melt into light, self-knowing penetrates everything, inserted bems po moves, wind movement finds its measure, body's atomic particles become visible, whatever appears becomes complete as form body, father and mother deities embrace, fivefold mandalas manifest, all within round halos. The yogi body itself becomes light and clear, with natural movement of going, coming, and sitting. All this indicates rigpa reaching measure.

[5301-5320]
The internal body measure shows the clearing of the body's coarse solidity. From a white A in the heart center, five light rays coil and emerge like the sun through a seeing-hole, shining in the sky's light window. The crown displays wisdom wind abiding with naturally uplifted appearance. The ushnisa radiates five-colored light to an arm-span's extent. The five fingers display light garlands. The body pores become doorways—the outer and inner atomic particles, each smaller than a particle's extent, reveal immeasurable pure fields where Buddhas and beings appear without number. This is the appearance of spontaneous presence's eight gates, all appearing as self-appearance without addition or subtraction.

[5321-5340]
The secret awareness measure manifests mandalas throughout the body. The skull center displays wrathful mandala, the heart center displays peaceful mandala, all body parts show natural emanation and subduing emanation. Various emanations appear as Buddha field self-appearance, benefitting beings. Through the compassion door, six clairvoyances manifest. Wisdom knowing all phenomena appears. The pure wisdom door opens, revealing pure Buddha fields as self-appearance saṃbhogakāya completion. The mind's stains clear, dust and doubt separate, ground and ground habitual tendencies self-purify. The Thalgyur citation establishes body transformation signs: body dust apart, outer space light window appearing, light ray hook shapes, slender and coiled holding appearance, body dust self-ceasing, pure light body, A syllable mark in center, crown light rays arm-span measure, crown tuft wind uplifted appearance, peaceful body fingers' light garlands pervading.

[5341-5360]
The progression continues with silent mind activity, skull kapala palace, Herukas manifesting. At this time one's own body reaches measure, three kayas unified in transparent purity. The secret awareness measure reveals how even coarse and subtle moving mind, along with all-ground consciousness, still contains mind without the qualities of awareness—without clairvoyance and foreknowledge. From that very state, mind becomes clear with six clairvoyances, knowing distant and hidden phenomena instantaneously, immeasurable Buddha fields appearing, even Buddha bodies appearing in mind. Empty mind's stains exhausted, nature unmoving empty-clear obtained, unmixed equal-complete sphere pervading, display of appearance without many divisions, without parts beyond elaboration. This occurs when the two previous appearances have purified afflictive mind and mental consciousness obscurations, obtaining this as the eighth collection's first seven are purified, liberated from coarse and subtle stains, body and mind connection severed.

[5361-5380]
The external appearance becomes object-cognition, with investigating consciousness as all-ground consciousness faculty acting as subject-condition. This dawns self-arising as fast as stars and meteors traverse space, self-liberating without looking to antidote. This arises from the power of wind being expelled outward and not gathered inward during the two previous appearances, from power that does not allow thought to remain even two instants. Body becomes transparent, consciousness all-ground portion becomes thought-free object-cognition like fire sparks spreading, clear and pure. Seeing both external appearance and internal self-appearance portions, body and mind sever connection, the supreme ground great mandala completes without returning to the three realms. The Thalgyur citation confirms: body-mind connection severed, consciousness with signs clear beyond contaminated body, like meteors spreading clear in space, that itself at first times, also separated from wind, pure wind's action arises from body expelling outward. From both seeing portions, body becomes clear light purity, mind like fire sparks spreading, not abiding unified self-clear ground, arising as two appearance portions. This severs body-mind connection, not returning to three realms.

[5381-5400]
At this time the seeing portion is like stars and meteors or spreading fire sparks as the all-ground consciousness portion, while rigpa's compassion wisdom portion has two aspects. The seen object appears as the two external and internal seen portions' cognition portion. At this time there is no deliberate gaze posture or other contrivance, never departing from dharmata's wheel, called completion of practice measure. The exhaustion of dharmata appearance has two aspects: brief presentation of exhaustion mode and extensive explanation of nature. From the previous measure-arrived full moon-like appearance, self-resonance dissolving into sphere mode is like the moon waning, the body dissolving into thigle and so on, definitely appearing to first mind. This applies the four modes of vessel-contents' formation-abiding-dissolution-emptiness to the four appearances' purification mode in sequence, similar to birth-aging-sickness-death's increase-decrease, outer vessel's formation dissolving, inner contents beings' lifespan increasing and decreasing as exhaustion signs.

[5401-5420]
If these do not exhaust, one does not liberate from the three realms. Thus as outer vessel's world exhausts, support ground gone, no returning ground. As inner contents beings exhaust, birth continuum ceases, rigpa itself beyond death. Then appearance has no established nature as anything, difficult to express as this is or is not, called dharmata exhaustion as meaning's result. Result means for the person difficult to express as this is or is not, inconceivable. Dharmata exhaustion at measure-arrived time means outer object inner body dharmas with dust exhaust, here all-ground consciousness's dharmas gathered by mind exhaust, all-ground's portion three doors' dharmata abiding, root fundamental ignorance that exhausts. Compared to confused dharmas, appearance's luminosity without arising-ceasing abiding in dharmata ultimate, from that dharmata pair exhausting called dharmata exhaustion.

[5421-5440]
Appearance means the previous spontaneous presence appearance existing, dissolving inward part by part, original purity's appearance like cloudless sky naturally pure, abiding momentarily called appearance—not appearance as thing and sign. At this time not observing even dharmata as dharmata, dharmata exhaustion. Subject object, dharmata that emptiness holding portion object-possessor gathered, three realms' mind mental events all-ground with returning time. Exhaustion mode has gradual and simultaneous. Gradual exhaustion is four appearances measure-arrived time. Simultaneous exhaustion is from first dharmata direct perception seen, familiarized, appearance increase and so forth not arising but exhausting, called supreme intelligence simultaneous. This is merely the exhaustion mode of those with past training's momentum, merely having great faith in teacher, merely having great superiority over others.

[5441-5460]
The extensive explanation of nature has five aspects: entity, etymology, nature, dharmata, and boundary. Dharmata exhaustion's entity means outer five-light appearance with body exhausted, inner with dust thought collections exhausted, experience appearance's object exhausted, original purity's appearance like sky's mode rigpa abiding. The Thalgyur citation: dharmata exhaustion appearance, experience's appearance empty, body exhausted sense object's object exhausted, thought collection confused liberation, expression ground's word apart. Etymology: dharmas means body speech mind's collection dharmas with afflictions, nye means training path's appearance luminosity meditation portion with, exhaustion means emptying, mind's meditation object appearance with self-reversed gone, non-observing called.

[5461-5480]
The nature means external internal appearance-mind exhausted, blue sky radiance like original purity's self-radiance only engaging. The Thalgyur citation: this time exhaustion's characteristic, beyond action like sky. Dharmata has two: appearance's dharmata means external internal with dust coarse wind exhausted, that exhausting mind-supported habitual tendencies all-arising characteristic subtle stains seed portions also exhausted, abiding in continuum absorption not departing dharmata's wheel, clairvoyance and great clairvoyance controlled, three realms dharmaraja's regent power obtained. All-ground subtle knowable obscuration completely cut like white silk curtain only apart, no obscuration, called path dharmas exhaustion result. Removing that, Buddhas with all obscurations apart entering inner sphere original purity dharmakāya, great peace.

[5481-5500]
The Thalgyur citation confirms: self-arisen exhausted dharmata, elements exhausted dust ceases, dust and subtle particle finally ceasing, portion part also not abiding, affliction exhausted confusion and, thought-free fixation not abiding, habitual tendency and all-arising, dust portion also not abiding. Thus coarse subtle exhausting, five aggregates also finally subtle, four elements' body exhausted, all wisdom complete body, thought-free absorption self-abiding, beyond contrived collection, dharmas called word not abiding. Empty dharmata means coarse channel wind exhausted mind and mental events exhausted, body and wisdom's appearance portion measure-arrived full moon-like also dissolving inner sphere, abiding in original purity's appearance, called dharmakāya's appearance, sphere result's dharmata self-appearance.

[5501-5520]
The earlier citation establishes cause and effect dharmata: coarse thought's source ceasing, memory self-pure from continuum, dependent relation wind itself pure, cause arisen dharmata. Originally pure nature, one and many's number transcended, body and wisdom without, dharmas exhaustion ground arrived, result's dharmata considered. The three later words if confused about, result's original purity without body and wisdom considered, great error arises from Nyingtig, not understanding the meaning expressed about external appearance radiance's body and wisdom crystal light dissolving inward portion. Actually without inner sphere contradicts spontaneous presence, unconditioned therefore later not existent destroyed contradicts, also from sphere body and wisdom's arising base beings' benefit arising contradicts, Samantabhadra ground sphere purified completion showing beings and Buddhas path compassion and activity contradicts, and so forth faults exist, not appropriate to accept such errors.

[5521-5540]
The fifth boundary means from measure-arrived curtain to exhaustion beginning, one's own four limbs' fingers five-light clear only existing, from this time entering inner sphere and returning to external appearance boundary exists. Also if that body form now does not actually widely arise for beings' benefit, rigpa placed on finger's light, external appearance and own body's luminosity all dissolving inward sphere going, direct object's appearance blue pure only, light body dissolving like crystal light dissolving inward. Body and appearance's self-radiance also reversed, inner clear spontaneous presence precious cocoon inside body and wisdom's depth radiance only rigpa abiding, external appearance blue appearing portion also not existing, like abiding in crystal clear mirror's shadow, rigpa dharmakāya Buddha coiled.

[5541-5560]
Returning to external appearance, that body not accomplishing Buddha's activity equal is the sign. Also from birth and entering's power, rigpa with compassion placed on beings, nothing existing original purity's appearance that self-reversed, confused appearance's appearance like mirror's reflection appearing, that body also like water's moon wisdom illusion body self-appearance transparent, apart from element's harm, vajra body obtained, called arising as great transference body for beings' benefit. Others' impure eyes see only with dust, not seeing transparent, like great teacher Vimala and Padma. Then obtaining power over birth and entering, instantaneously Buddha though remaining, benefiting beings until samsara not empty also self-power obtained.

[5561-5580]
Birth power means entering inner sphere time, inserting rigpa into three thousand beings, all liberating simultaneously great power obtained, even insects dissolving into light. Obtaining birth's power means manifesting whatever desired, spontaneously accomplishing beings' benefit. Entering's power means even inserting rigpa into bems po makes it move and utter sounds, lotus and wish-fulfilling tree and jewel and so forth producing dharma sounds, maturing all beings, raining food and clothing. These two powers over birth and entering obtained at exhaustion's following inner sphere entry mouth, if not returning for beings' benefit, liberating three thousand beings simultaneously in bardo then entering sphere. If doing, birth power returning, gradually liberating three thousand, with many births entrances for eons fields' dust-sand beings' benefit whatever accomplished.

[5581-5600]
Earth treasure, jewel, dharma enumerations and so forth long time benefit accomplished, that method not even an instant departed, therefore from others compassion miraculously arising and activity blessing engaging. Therefore relying on our supreme teacher Vimala and Padma Arya like that, whether this or bardo definitely liberated. These modes from Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: inner body exhaustion ground arrived time, fingers and so forth similarly appearing, this arising elements self-exhaust. Birth and entering's distinction, all dharmas exhaustion's own ground, nothing holding abiding, illusory body. This enters engaging's power, birth's self-power who obtained, that also placed on that, again time thus done, appearance's self-sound silence sound, manifestly reversed confused appearing. This does all beings' benefit, rigpa equal one, three thousand beings' great transference accomplishes. Thus gradual and simultaneous, body this accomplishes, all body exhaustion measure liberated, all result certain, supreme ground great mandala completes.

[5601-5620]
The fourth meaning's boundary-supported oral instruction four previous ones' back support or close connection. These are: three unmoving establishing base with body, three vows measuring, three obtaining piercing, four confidences showing liberation measure. The Thalgyur citation: there boundary-support confidence, three unmoving base established, wind-mind essential point arrived. Three abiding measures measured, dream reversing and body speech mind, signs and measure certainly determined. Three obtaining piercing, contaminated aggregates not appearing. From Mutig Trengwa: measure is four confidences' yogin. First three unmoving establishing base stabilizing nirvana ground: body's three unmoving essential points pressing, speech's three unmoving path clearing, mind's three unmoving extracting juice rolling.

[5621-5640]
First body's three unmoving: pervasive abiding posture's unmoving channel essential point placed, arising seeing posture's unmoving path straightened, extracting holding posture's unmoving wind's going-stopping blocked. First from Mutig Trengwa: body's essential point these three, lion manner and elephant manner, know like rishi. On emanation body's abiding posture, sound explanation and meaning division two.
