Structural function: Statement of Buddhist superiority (chos khyad par) in doxographical analysis. Unlike outsider (mu stegs) systems, Buddhism has no acceptance-rejection (blang dor) or purity-filth (dag dri) divisions. Lower vehicles cannot practice deity union (lha syll) as found in higher tantras. Buddhist realization of inseparable truth superior to partial outsider views. View register: traditional Buddhist doxography with evaluative hierarchy. Translation risk: Modernizing the evaluative stance into relativism destroys the traditional framework. Preservation: The evaluative hierarchy must remain clear without becoming sectarian polemic.

[3317-3321]
Extended recognition that this is not sectarian polemic but recognition of progressive subtlety in spiritual teachings. Outsider systems are not rejected as wrong but recognized as partial—valid up to a point, yet incomplete. The superiority of Buddhism lies not in cultural chauvinism but in the comprehensiveness of its view. The translator must preserve this evaluative stance while avoiding both modern relativism and aggressive sectarianism.

[3317-3321]
Overall structural recognition: This brief section establishes the traditional Buddhist evaluative framework within which the entire Tenet Systems analysis operates. The recognition required is that hierarchies of view are pedagogical, not ontological—they describe increasing subtlety of understanding, not inherent superiority of persons or cultures.
