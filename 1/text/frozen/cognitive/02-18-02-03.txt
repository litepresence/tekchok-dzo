Vajra eye and water bubble eye wisdom distinctions. Vajra eye sees pure wisdom appearances—great expansion of wisdom luminosity, eventually leading to liberation. Water bubble eye sees four aspects of appearance—all appearances arise as water bubbles, impermanent. The two eyes: vajra eye is spontaneous presence (lhun grub), water bubble eye is the wisdom realizing impermanence. When water bubble eye sees subtle appearances, recognizes them as impermanent—arising, passing, moving like bubbles. Three aspects: appearances as bubbles, beings as bubbles, coming and going as bubbles. Structural note: enumerates different wisdom-eye types and their functions.
