[12478-12499]
Mythic cosmogony: delusion arising from primordial basis (gzhi). Basis appears from ground, deluded by Three Ignorances (ma rig pa gsum) and Four Conditions (rkyen bzhi). symbolic narrative of samsara emerging from purity. Self-arisen rigpa is pure Buddha, yet delusion arises from early basis.

Symbolic elements: Field Broad (yang pa), Place Beautiful (mdzes pa), Pig Year (phag lo), Sun Created (bskyed pa), Star Bird (skar bya), Old One Who Possesses Heap (gsol 'dzin rgan po). Four friends, five wild-men, one back-support, one thief, one accumulator—all delusion sources. All arises from basis possessing no delusion.

Key teaching: delusion arises from basis with no delusion—obscuration is adventitious, not inherent.
