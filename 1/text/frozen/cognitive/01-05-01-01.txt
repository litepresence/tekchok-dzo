Tantra exposition framework establishing the Dzogchen classification system. Meaning tantra: mind-nature naturally luminous clear light (rang bzhin gyis 'od gsal ba), free from conceptual stains (rnam par rtog pa'i dri ma). Dzogchen view register established at outset. Technical terminology requires precise rendering—naturally luminous describes inherent clarity, conceptual stains refers to obscuring mental constructs. The structural distinction between indicating and indicated tantras frames all subsequent exposition.

Indicated tantra classification. Six sections: Mind (sems sde), Space (klong sde), Instruction (man ngag sde), each divided into outer, inner, secret. Alternative twofold classification: effortless self-liberation, graduated with effort. Alternative fourfold: outer, inner, secret, suchness (de bzhin nyid). Comprehensive classification demonstrating Dzogchen systematic completeness. Recognition: These classifications are not competing systems but different entry points for practitioners of varying capacity.

Mind section detailed enumeration. Outer mind: sems sde with teachers (Garab Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrī Siṃha), locations (Uḍḍiyāna, Sitavana cemetery, Bhotī mountain), specific texts (Kun byed rgyal po, Byang chub kyi sems bde ba 'byung, etc.). Inner mind: klong sde fourfold subdivision (outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed). Secret mind: man ngag sde with cutting through (khregs chod) and direct transcendence (thod rgal). Instruction section: outer, inner, secret, innermost. Each with authoritative lineage attribution. establish authentic transmission lineage through teacher, place, and text enumeration.

Effortless versus gradual distinction. Self-liberation without effort (rtsol med rang grol) for highest capacity. Graduated path with effort (rtsol bcas rim gyis) for others. Not hierarchical judgment but pedagogical accommodation—Dzogchen provides methods appropriate to each capacity. Maintain Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition while acknowledging gradual methods for those requiring them.

Overall structural recognition: This section establishes the complete Dzogchen tantric classification system with multiple organizational schemes. The recognition required is that these classifications serve pedagogical purposes, creating entry points for practitioners of different capacities. The extensive enumeration of teachers, locations, and texts establishes authentic lineage transmission. The translator must preserve the technical precision of the classifications while maintaining understanding that they describe one truth approached from multiple angles.

The classification systems serve to organize the vast Dzogchen literature into comprehensible frameworks.
Each system provides a different perspective on the same teachings, allowing practitioners to find their appropriate entry point.
The enumeration of teachers, locations, and texts establishes the authenticity of the transmission lineage.
Translator must preserve the precise classification schemes while understanding they point to a single truth.
The Dzogchen classification includes Mind, Space, and Instruction sections, each with outer, inner, and secret subdivisions.
The Mind section emphasizes the nature of mind as primordially pure and naturally luminous.
The Space section emphasizes the expanse in which all phenomena arise and dissolve.
The Instruction section provides the practical methods for realizing these truths.
The effortless path is for those of highest capacity who can recognize the natural state directly.
The gradual path with effort accommodates those who need structured practice to prepare for recognition.
Both paths lead to the same realization of primordial purity and spontaneous presence.
The translator must understand that these classifications are pedagogical tools, not ontological distinctions.
