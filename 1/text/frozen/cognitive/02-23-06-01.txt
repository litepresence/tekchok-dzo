[Comprehensive Synthesis]
This section establishes complete framework for thod rgal visionary practice. Light dissolution mechanics demonstrate how external appearances resolve into internal recognition. Buddha-body manifestations show how wisdom appears spontaneously without fabrication. Heart center light connection reveals how self-recognition operates. Visionary intensification indicates increasing clarity. Four wisdoms union appearance provides systematic anatomy of recognition.

The progression from dharmadhatu wisdom through all-accomplishing wisdom establishes complete mandala. Each wisdom represents transformation of corresponding poison: dharmadhatu transforms delusion, mirror-like transforms aversion, equality transforms pride, discriminating transforms attachment, all-accomplishing transforms jealousy. Through recognition, afflictive emotions become wisdoms.

The visionary process demonstrates Dzogchen's unique approach to enlightenment—not through elimination of defilements but through recognition of their true nature. Appearances that seem external are recognized as self-display. Defilements that seem obstructive are recognized as wisdom. The path is not purification but recognition.

Final recognition: All appearances dissolve into natural state. Wisdoms merge into single essence. Visionary experiences exhaust themselves. What remains is primordial purity, spontaneously present, never apart from recognition.
