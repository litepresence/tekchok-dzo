[10086-10114]
Structural function establishes the outermost level (phyi'i phyi) of mind samaya (sems kyi dam tshig) as the abandonment of harmful intention (gnod sems spang ba), citing the Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken Tantra (snying po'i don rnam par len pa'i rgyud) to provide scriptural authority for this fundamental commitment. The progression from general harmful mind to specific objects of harm creates a graduated framework where the severity of violation corresponds to the spiritual proximity of the harmed being. View register presents harmful intention as the root violation that undermines all tantric practice regardless of other attainments, emphasizing that samaya operates at the level of motivation rather than merely action. Translation risks reduce gnod sems to merely "wishing harm" rather than recognizing it as the complete spectrum of aggressive mental activity including resentment, jealousy, and competitive rivalry that constitutes the root of samaya violation. Preservation requirements note the citation structure establishes tantric authority as paramount, with quotations from root tantras providing the foundation for all subsequent commitments, ensuring that readers understand these as revealed teachings rather than philosophical constructions.

[10115-10125]
Structural function introduces the outer-inner level (phyi'i nang) specifically targeting harmful mind toward guru and vajra siblings (bla mched), citing the Sky-Iron Fire Blazing Tantra (gnam lcags me 'bar ba'i rgyud) to establish exponentially greater karmic consequences for harming those bound by tantric connection. The mathematical progression—ordinary beings equal to killing three hundred lives, teaching holders and mantra practitioners multiplying to seven and one hundred times respectively—demonstrates the precise calculus of karma operating within the tantric framework. View register presents the guru-vajra sibling relationship as creating a karmic resonance where harm reverberates through the entire mandala structure, affecting not only the immediate target but the entire lineage and all connected practitioners. Translation risks obscure the technical term bstan pa'i rtags 'dzin pa as merely "teaching holders" rather than recognizing it as those who embody the symbolic representation of the teaching, whose harm creates symbolic damage to the Dharma itself. Preservation requirements maintain the specific numerical values (seven-times for vajra siblings, hundred-times for lineage gurus, hundred-times-squared for root guru) that establish a precise hierarchy of commitment intensity, ensuring that the graduated severity is accurately transmitted.

[10126-10140]
Structural function addresses the outer-secret level (phyi'i gsang) concerning wrong views toward established philosophical positions (rang gzhag grub mtha'), citing the Great Arrangement (bkod pa chen po) to establish that philosophical nihilism regarding valid spiritual systems constitutes a fundamental root samaya violation. The specific consequences—sa spyod me yi sdug bsngal (earth-dweller fire suffering)—indicate that wrong view leads to particular types of hell realm experience characterized by instability and combustion, reflecting the nature of wrong view itself as mentally destabilizing and "burning" with conceptual fixation. View register presents philosophical wrong view as more dangerous than moral transgression because it undermines the very basis for liberation, creating obstacles not just to comfort but to the possibility of awakening itself. Translation risks reduce log par lta ba to merely "wrong view" without conveying the technical specificity of philosophical positions that deny valid cognition, dependent origination, or the possibility of liberation. Preservation requirements note the distinction between rang gi grub mthar log lta (wrong view toward one's own system) and gzhen gyi grub mthar log lta (wrong view toward others' systems), establishing that both constitute violations with the former being particularly severe as it involves betrayal of one's own commitments.

[10141-10165]
Structural function details the mind-inner-outer level (thugs kyi nang gi phyi) encompassing conduct (spyod pa), meditation (sgom pa), and view (lta ba), citing the Crystal House Stacked Tantra (shel gyi khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud) to establish that wrong engagement at any of these three levels constitutes a "great wrong path" (lam log chen po) that aggregates the suffering of all beings into one's own mindstream. The comprehensive scope—covering view, meditation, and conduct—demonstrates that samaya pervades every aspect of tantric practice without exception. View register presents the integration of view, meditation, and conduct as the hallmark of tantric authenticity, where deviation in any area indicates fundamental misunderstanding that contaminates the entire path. Translation risks separate lta sgom spyod into disconnected categories rather than recognizing them as the unified triad of wisdom, meditation, and activity that characterizes complete practice. Preservation requirements maintain the citation from the Crystal House Stacked Tantra that specifically addresses this integration, ensuring that readers understand these three aspects as necessarily coherent rather than independently negotiable.

[10166-10178]
Structural function establishes the secret-outer level (gsang ba'i phyi) concerning view, meditation, and conduct, while introducing the secret-inner level (gsang ba'i nang) focused on the yi-dam deity (yi dam lha) and the secret-secret level (gsang ba'i gsang ba) requiring day-and-night mindfulness of guru and vajra siblings, citing the Lotus Klong Tantra (padma klong gi rgyud) and Co-Arisen Near-Taken Tantra (lhan cig skyes pa nye bar len pa'i rgyud) to establish the progressive interiorization of commitment. The temporal specification nyin zhag tu yid la byas pa—mindfulness day and night—indicates that secret samaya operates continuously without interruption, unlike overt practices that may have defined sessions. View register presents this progressive interiorization as moving from overt activity to continuous subtle mindfulness, demonstrating how tantric commitment deepens from observable behavior to the constant texture of awareness itself. Translation risks reduce yi dam lha to merely "tutelary deity" without conveying the technical sense of the deity as the enlightened form one is destined to become through the practice commitment. Preservation requirements note the specific temporal phrase nyin zhag tu establishes that secret samaya is not session-bound but operates as continuous mindfulness, distinguishing it from lower levels of commitment that may have defined temporal boundaries.

[10179-10205]
Structural function cites the Supreme Trunk Samaya Arrangements Tantra (dam tshig rnam par bkod pa mchog gi sdong po'i rgyud) to provide a comprehensive summary of samaya commitments encompassing promise-keeping (dam bca'), guru commitment integrity (bla ma'i khas blangs), correct guru activity (bla ma'i bya ba ma log), body-speech-mind alignment with Dharma (lus ngag sems chos las mi 'phran), continuous benefit to beings (sems can gyi don), guru respect (bla ma la gus), samaya non-transgression (dam tshig mi 'da'), vajra and bell holding (rdo rje dril bu 'dzin), and mantra substances (sngags 'os pa'i rdzas). This comprehensive enumeration establishes that samaya is not reducible to any single commitment but constitutes a complete way of life organized around tantric values and relationships. View register presents this comprehensive list as demonstrating the all-encompassing nature of tantric commitment, where every aspect of existence becomes saturated with sacred significance and ethical obligation. Translation risks fragment the list into discrete "rules" rather than recognizing it as an integrated description of a total lifestyle organized around tantric realization. Preservation requirements maintain the complete enumeration without abbreviation, ensuring that the full scope of commitment is transmitted rather than a reduced selection that might seem more manageable but would misrepresent the tradition's comprehensiveness.

[10206-10224]
Structural function cites the extensive passage from Thal 'gyur (presumably a text by that name) establishing guru as Buddha support (bla ma sangs rgyas mchod pa'i rten), continuous offering to guru-Dharma-Sangha-yi-dam-vajra dakinis (tshogs dang mchod pa rgyun mi gcod), guru characteristic-seeing complete worship (bla ma mtshan nyis ldan mthong na bstod dang mchod pa rdzogs par bya), non-disparagement of women and non-anger (bud med mi smad khro mi bya), non-disparagement of aggregates and yi-dam reliance (phung po mi smad yi dam bsten), correct reliance on mandala-mantra-deity-mudra (dkyil 'khor dang ni sngags dang lha phyag rgya bsten pa yang dag nyid), and non-disturbance of faithful assembly virtuous mind (dad can tshogs nyid mi gcag la dge ldan sems ni mi dkhrugs). The comprehensive scope extends beyond individual practice to include respectful treatment of the entire tantric community and its symbolic representations. View register presents this comprehensive enumeration as demonstrating that samaya encompasses not only what one does personally but how one relates to the entire mandala of practice including community, symbols, and the feminine principle. Translation risks reduce bud med mi smad to merely "not disparaging women" without recognizing it as the protection of the feminine principle in tantra as the representative of wisdom and prajna. Preservation requirements note the specific inclusion of phung po mi smad establishes that even the aggregates, conventionally the basis of suffering, are not to be disparaged in tantra where they are recognized as the five buddhas, ensuring that nihilistic attitudes toward embodiment are avoided.

[10225-10240]
Structural function concludes the graduated training presentation (bslab pa'i rim pa) with detailed practice instructions including perfecting body conduct (lus kyi spyod pa rdzogs bya), cutting speech (ngag ni rab tu gcad), abiding and examining mind (sems ni gnas dang brtag cing dpyad), progressive entry action stages (rim 'jug las kyi rim pa bya), continuous mudra and pill practice (rtag tu phyag dang ri lu'i las), channel entry into bindu net (rtsa rnams thig le'i drwa bar gzhug), beautiful ornamented necklaces and half-mudra (phreng ba do shal phyed pa yang mdzes shing), turning wheels ('khor lo sgrol bar bya), and taking the supreme actual-accomplishment lord (dngos grub mchog gi gtsos po blang). These technical instructions establish the practical application of samaya beyond mere abstention from violation, demonstrating how commitment manifests as positive engagement with tantric technique. View register presents these technical instructions as the positive complement to the negative prohibitions, showing how samaya creates the conditions for accomplishment rather than merely preventing obstacles. Translation risks obscure the technical terms phyag (mudra), ri lu (pill), rtsa (channel), thig le (bindu), do shal (necklace) that refer to specific yogic practices, potentially reducing them to generic spiritual terminology. Preservation requirements maintain the precise technical vocabulary that connects these instructions to the completion stage practices of the Six Yogas, ensuring that the practical dimension of samaya is transmitted alongside the ethical prohibitions.

[10241-10270]
Structural function cites the Jeweled Arrayed Wheel Tantra ('khor lo rin po che rnam par brtsegs pa'i rgyud) to establish the immeasurable consequences of transgressing body, speech, and mind samayas, comparing such violations to simultaneously killing all beings in the three realms or cutting the tongues of all world inhabitants—hyperbolic imagery designed to convey the magnitude of karmic consequence rather than literal equivalence. The specific hierarchy of severity—body samaya transgression leading to separation from Buddha body, speech samaya to separation from Buddha speech, mind samaya to disturbance of all meditators' minds—demonstrates how each aspect of commitment corresponds to a particular dimension of realization and its violation creates corresponding obstacles. View register presents these hyperbolic comparisons as upaya—skillful means to impress upon practitioners the gravity of samaya violation, not literal predictions but dramatic pedagogical devices designed to inspire carefulness. Translation risks interpret these comparisons literally as threats of specific punishments rather than recognizing them as pedagogical hyperbole designed to convey the relative severity of different violations within a karmic framework. Preservation requirements note the specific comparison to killing all three-realm beings establishes the severity of root samaya violation while the tongue-cutting comparison establishes speech samaya violation as particularly related to communication and teaching, maintaining the specific correspondences between violation type and karmic consequence.

[10271-10300]
Structural function emphasizes that guru-related degenerations are particularly severe (lci ste), citing the Glorious Inexhaustible Sky Tantra (dpal nam mkha' mi zad pa'i rgyud) to establish that even without malicious mind (ngan pa'i sems med par), mere loss of mindfulness (dran pa nyams pa) or carelessness (bag med gyur pa) toward the guru creates negative karma that, if not immediately confessed, leads to uninterrupted hell suffering. The tripartite confession structure—de nying pa (confession), nyes pa (misdeed), and gsum (three doors)—establishes the protocol for repairing samaya violations through acknowledging the specific mode of transgression at the levels of body, speech, and mind. View register presents the guru-relationship as creating the most sensitive and potent karmic connection, where even unintentional neglect or distraction produces severe consequences due to the guru's role as the living embodiment of the path and source of blessings. Translation risks reduce gshin rje'i gshed (Yama) references to merely "hell" without conveying the specific association with the Lord of Death who presides over the judgment of karma, a particularly appropriate image for samaya violations that are said to shorten life and lead to untimely death. Preservation requirements maintain the specific protocol for confession through the three doors (lus ngag yid gsum), ensuring that repair practices address the complete scope of violation rather than merely verbal acknowledgment without behavioral transformation.

[10301-10330]
Structural function continues the presentation of specific samaya violations and their consequences, maintaining the comprehensive scope that encompasses not only overt harmful actions but subtle deviations in attitude and attention. The emphasis on immediate confession (de ma thag tu bshags pa) establishes the time-sensitive nature of samaya repair, where delays allow negative karma to increase like interest on a debt, making eventual confession more difficult and the consequences more severe. The specification that mind samaya operates continuously, without the temporal boundaries that might limit other practices, indicates that this level of commitment requires the most profound transformation of habitual patterns. View register presents time as a critical factor in samaya dynamics, where the interval between violation and confession determines the magnitude of karmic consequence, demonstrating the active and responsive nature of karma within the tantric framework. Translation risks obscure the urgency conveyed by de ma thag tu (immediately, without delay), potentially reducing it to merely "should confess" without the temporal imperative that gives the instruction its force. Preservation requirements note the continuous operation of mind samaya (sems kyi dam tshig) without session boundaries establishes it as the most demanding level of commitment, requiring practitioners to maintain the highest degree of vigilance and mindfulness throughout all activities.

[10331-10360]
Structural function expands the scope of samaya to include protection of the Vajra Vehicle's distinctive features, emphasizing that commitments apply not only to one's own practice but to the preservation of the tradition's integrity against distortion or dilution. The protection of secret teachings (gsang ba'i chos) from inappropriate dissemination establishes the responsibility of practitioners to maintain the esoteric dimension of tantra, ensuring that advanced practices are not revealed to those lacking the necessary preparation and commitment. This protection is not motivated by elitism but by compassion—preventing harm that could arise from premature exposure to powerful techniques without the stabilizing context of proper preparation and commitment. View register presents secrecy as a protective measure for both the teachings and potential practitioners, recognizing that tantric techniques are powerful and potentially dangerous when approached without proper foundation, similar to how advanced medical procedures require appropriate training. Translation risks interpret gsang ba as merely "secret" in the conventional sense of hidden information, rather than recognizing it as "esoteric"—teachings whose power depends on proper context and preparation, which would be misunderstood or misused if revealed inappropriately. Preservation requirements maintain the protective dimension of samaya as extending beyond personal conduct to include stewardship of the tradition, ensuring that practitioners understand their role in maintaining the integrity of the teachings for future generations.

[10361-10385]
Structural function concludes the comprehensive presentation of mind samaya by reiterating the foundational importance of guru devotion as the axis around which all other commitments revolve, citing multiple scriptural sources to establish the guru as the embodiment of all buddhas and the source of all accomplishments. The synthesis of multiple citations creates a cumulative authority that demonstrates the universal recognition of guru devotion across tantric lineages and texts, establishing it as non-negotiable rather than merely recommended. This emphasis does not negate the ultimate view of guru as one's own mind, but establishes the relative necessity of relating to the external guru as the skillful means to discover the inner guru. View register presents the guru as the living bridge between relative and absolute, the form through which formless realization is transmitted and recognized, making the guru-relationship the central and irreplaceable element of tantric practice. Translation risks reduce guru devotion to merely "respecting one's teacher" without conveying the technical sense of guru yoga as the essential practice that synthesizes all other practices, the royal road to realization that makes all other methods effective. Preservation requirements note the comprehensive citation strategy demonstrates that guru devotion is not idiosyncratic to particular lineages but universal across tantric Buddhism, ensuring that readers understand this emphasis as fundamental to the tradition rather than sectarian bias.
