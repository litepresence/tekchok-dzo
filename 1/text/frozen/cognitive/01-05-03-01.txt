Enumeration of the eightfold textual corpus structure. Root tantras two: Dzogpa Rangjung (Self-Arising Perfection) and Yige Medpa (Letterless Tantra). Explanatory tantras mother-and-child two: Rigpa Rangshar and Rigpa Rangdrol. Branch tantras two: Rinpoche Pungpa and Kudung Barwa. Clarification tantras two: Drathalgyur and Tashi Dzeden. Instructional tantras four: Dorje Sempa Nyinggi Melong, Kunzang Thugkyi Melong, Ngotro Dzepa, and Mutik Trengwa. Self-abiding intention tantras three: Klong Drukpa, Dronma Barwa, and Nyida Kajor. Self-liberated entry tantras two: Senge Tsal Dzog and Norbu Thrakö. Expert ritual tantra one: Nagmo Khrosma. Structural function: establishing authoritative textual basis for all teachings through systematic catalog. View register: Dzogchen textual hierarchy where all tantras ultimately point to rigpa. Translation risk: missing the organic metaphor system—root/branch/flower/fruit as developmental rather than essential. Preservation: the numerical precision (2+2+2+4+3+2+1=17) establishes complete corpus integrity.

[4670-4691]
Scriptural citation from Mutik Trengwa establishing the eightfold structure through poetic enumeration. Lines 4671-4690 present the tantric corpus in verse form, each category associated with specific pedagogical function. The structural function: canonical confirmation through renowned Dzogchen source text. View register: the entire corpus as unified expression of single intention. Translation risk: the poetic meter may obscure technical precision. Preservation: each line of the citation corresponds to one category, maintaining the eight-part structure established in prose.

[4692-4710]
Rationale for the eightfold structure through seven similes. Root tantras like healthy tree roots—without them branches cannot grow. Explanatory tantras like leaves and flowers—without them fruit cannot emerge. Branch tantras like limbs—without them one falls climbing rocks. Entry tantras like heart—without it the body cannot benefit others. Clarification tantras like flowers—without them fruit does not ripen. Instructional tantras like fruit—without them effort is wasted. Intention tantras like eyes—without them one cannot see the path. Ritual tantra like guard dog—without it thieves steal wealth. Structural function: demonstrating organic necessity of each category. View register: all eight as indispensable limbs of single body of teaching. Translation risk: the similes may read as decorative rather than demonstrating structural interdependence. Preservation: the precise correspondences—roots/trunk/limbs/heart/flowers/fruit/eyes/dog—establish functional hierarchy.

[4711-4720]
Etymological analysis of the eight category names. Root (rtsa ba): like penetrating root, refers to mind as root of all dharmas. Explanation (bshad pa): like spreading leaves, refers to joining words and meanings. Branch (yan lag): like entwined trunk, refers to space and rigpa as non-dual. Clarification (lung rigs): like blooming flowers, refers to demonstrating luminosity's own face. Instruction (man ngag): like ripening fruit, refers to actualizing the three kayas as path. Intention (dgongs pa): like liberating vision, refers to making result into path. Entry ('jug pa): like invoking memory, refers to introducing the lamp itself. Expert ritual (mkhas pa cho ga): like completing instruction, refers to preserving the holy teachings long. Structural function: unpacking semantic depths of category names. View register: each name encodes complete Dzogchen view. Translation risk: etymological explanations may seem tangential to main argument. Preservation: the Tibetan wordplay (rtsa ba/rtsa ba, lo 'dab/bsre ba) must be noted even if not reproducible in translation.

[4721-4728]
Benefits of engaging the textual corpus. Holding the tantra: rigpa recognizes its own face. Keeping it: samadhi self-abides. Reading it: meaning of topic dawns in mind. Explaining it: obtaining supreme and common siddhis. Meditating on it: pushing out samsara. Listening to it: engaging temporary wisdom. Structural function: establishing practical value of textual transmission. View register: the tantras as direct support for recognition. Translation risk: benefits may read as magical rather than pointing to natural functions. Preservation: the progression from holding to listening represents graduated engagement levels.

[4729-4738]
Distinction between word-instruction and meaning-instruction. Verbal elaboration of instructions: missing the point through words. Essence-compressed meaning-instruction: awakening without relying on words. Structural function: establishing superiority of direct pointing over textual elaboration. View register: the ultimate instruction transcends its verbal form. Translation risk: appearing to contradict the previous emphasis on textual corpus. Preservation: this is not rejection of texts but recognition that they point beyond themselves.

[4739-4749]
Technical definitions of key terms. Lung: unchanging and stable, producing confident faith. Rigpa: depending on that meaning, liberating into buddhahood. Salwa: clear knowing without abiding anywhere; clear senses distinguishing dharma and non-dharma. Entry: emptiness entering into appearance, appearance and mind mouth-joining; appearance entering emptiness, object and mind non-dual, self-liberated without correction. Structural function: precise terminology establishing conceptual foundation. View register: each term points to direct recognition rather than philosophical position. Translation risk: definitions may seem circular or tautological. Preservation: the Tibetan technical precision must be maintained—lung as authoritative scripture, rigpa as knowledge, salwa as clarity, 'jug pa as dynamic entry.

[4750-4755]
Five types of expertise (mkhas pa). Expert in mother's time and crucial points: destroying the object of accomplishment through mere thought. Expert in activity and its completion: stealing the life of the object of accomplishment through mere contemplation without mantra or samadhi. Expert in mother's mantra and samadhi: deities become near, siddhis arise. Expert in mother's approach and accomplishment: one's desired aim is accomplished. Expert in substance and offering: prosperity increases, activities succeed. Structural function: establishing ritual mastery as corollary to textual study. View register: expertise as natural expression of recognition rather than acquired skill. Translation risk: ritual language may seem irrelevant to Dzogchen view. Preservation: the mother's yoga (ma mo) context establishes tantric foundation for Dzogchen.

[4756-4763]
Graduated teachings for three capacities. Those delighting in mental elaboration: all is taught. Middling: accomplished through eight tantras gathered into eight sections. Superior: meaning condensed into tantras. Divided by method: two. Divided by nature: three. Five are sufficient. Moreover, for the excellent: tantras of meaning and words both taught. For the extremely excellent beyond elaboration: ground tantra rigpa alone accomplishes, because rigpa contains all tantras. Structural function: establishing graduated curriculum based on student capacity. View register: single intention expressed through multiple formats. Translation risk: hierarchical language may seem elitist rather than pedagogically necessary. Preservation: the five/two/three numerical structure represents complete curriculum design.

[4764-4784]
Scriptural citation from Thalgyur establishing the nature of tantra. Lines 4765-4783 enumerate eighteen named tantras with their specific functions, concluding that all arise from the ground. The structural function: comprehensive canonical enumeration providing textual authority. View register: all eighteen as expressions of single Dzogchen intention. Translation risk: the list format may seem tedious rather than demonstrating completeness. Preservation: each tantra name encodes specific teaching function—Thalgyur (Sound Transcendent), Senge Tsal Dzog (Lion Force Perfected), etc.

[4785-4797]
Alternative enumeration by capacity. For those with elaboration: ground and heart tantras, all bindu cycles. Middling: seventeen. Superior: Self-Arising Seed Tantra alone. Summit: liberation through three—before, after, and simultaneous. Structural function: demonstrating that enumeration depends on student needs. View register: the same truth expressed through different scopes. Translation risk: numerical variation may seem contradictory. Preservation: citation from Ati Kopa Chenpo establishes this graduated approach as canonical.

[4798-4847]
Explanation methodology framework. Three aspects: how to explain, enumeration of preliminaries, definitive prophecy. First has three: structural framework, method of explanation, letter meaning explanation. Generally, many explanation traditions but summarized as three: scriptural explanation, tantric explanation, instruction explanation. Scriptural: through five perfections. Tantric: through three definite locations. Instruction: through ground, path, and result. Here primarily tantric explanation with three locations: for sharp faculties through mentioning name, expressing tantra name meaning; middling through mentioning mere enumeration, expressing preliminaries through five perfections; dull through examples and meanings, extensively explaining the body. First: name explanation, signs, and samaya. Second: preliminaries of teacher, mother, retinue, father's request, omniscience. Third: body brief, extensive, very extensive, conclusion with rejoicing in meaning. Structural function: establishing hermeneutical framework for textual interpretation. View register: explanation itself as recognition support. Translation risk: methodological detail may seem pedantic. Preservation: the three-faculty schema represents standard pedagogical organization.
