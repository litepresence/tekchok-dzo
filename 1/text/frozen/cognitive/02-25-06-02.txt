[16770-16791]
Opening of extensive enumeration chapter presenting the fourth variation of Buddha-attribute analysis. The "fivefold perfections" (phun sum tshogs pa lnga) structure is applied across external, internal, and secret dimensions. pure land cosmology with five-fold excellence formula. Domesticating "phun sum tshogs pa" into generic "perfect" loses the specific enumerative resonance. The five excellences must remain clearly enumerated across all three Dharma-wheel turnings.

[16792-16810]
External five perfections presentation with Vulture Peak as exemplary location. The formula is place-teacher-Dharma-retinue-time, establishing the complete sambhogakaya field. Register: classic Mahayana pure land description. Risk: Over-familiarity with the formula makes it invisible—reader misses the structural completeness being asserted. The fivefold architecture represents the necessary and sufficient conditions for Dharma transmission.

[16811-16842]
Internal and secret five perfections extending the formula to less manifest dimensions. Akanishta as internal place, wrathful heruka as secret teacher. This is the tantric extension of Mahayana pure land cosmology. Register shifts to Guhyagarbha-style visualization. Risk: The threefold division (external/internal/secret) appears redundant without recognizing progressive subtlety. Each level represents different capacity recipients, not hierarchical superiority. The internal dimension serves yogins with subtle body practice capacity, while the secret dimension serves those with direct recognition of energetic wisdom.

[16843-16854]
Wisdom-abiding ground (gzhi gnas) presentation opening the second major topic. The threefold wisdom structure—ground, sambhogakaya, emanation—mirrors the three-kāya architecture applied to gnosis. Register: Dzogchen rigpa terminology. Risk: Collapsing the three wisdoms into generic "Buddha-wisdom" misses the functional distinctions. Each wisdom-type corresponds to different ontological levels of knowing.

[16855-16880]
Sambhogakaya wisdom fivefold enumeration mapping to five Buddha-families. The mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, and dharmadhatu wisdoms correspond to Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, and Vairochana. Register: standard Yogacara-Tantra synthesis. Risk: The 25-wisdom elaboration (5×5) threatens to overwhelm the reader. The fivefold structure must remain navigable even in detailed enumeration.

[16881-16914]
Emanation-kaya wisdom twofold structure: knowing extent (ji snyed) and knowing nature (ji lta ba). This is the epistemological foundation for emanation-kaya function—knowing both what appears and how it truly is. Register: classic pramana distinction applied to Buddha-cognition. Risk: Pramana terminology in Tibetan (ji lta/ji snyed) is technical and must be preserved precisely. The distinction between conventional and ultimate cognition must remain epistemologically rigorous.

[16915-16941]
Three wisdom synthesis demonstrating how Buddha-cognition operates across three-kāya levels simultaneously. The recognition required is that these are not sequential but co-present. Ground wisdom as basis, sambhogakaya wisdom as clarity, emanation wisdom as manifestation. Register: Dzogchen synthesis. Risk: Temporal language ("first...then...finally") in translation destroys the simultaneity. Non-temporal, non-causal presentation of what is always already complete.

[16942-16971]
Summary conclusion synthesizing all five Buddha-attributes as three-kāya embodiment. The extensive enumeration collapses into essence-formula: all Buddha-qualities are fivefold organized and threefold embodied. Register: synthetic closure. Risk: Missing the summary function treats this as mere repetition. The return to summary after exhaustive enumeration is pedagogically essential—it confirms what has been established through analysis.

[16770-16810]
Extended recognition of the five perfections architecture across external, internal, and secret dimensions. The recognition required is that Longchenpa applies a consistent analytical template to three levels of manifestation, demonstrating structural isomorphism across all Buddha-fields. The external five perfections with Vulture Peak location establish the baseline Mahayana pure land formula. The internal five perfections with Akanishta location demonstrate the tantric subtle-body equivalent. The secret five perfections with cremation ground location reveal the most subtle energetic dimension. This is not three different things but one truth seen from three capacity-levels. The translator must preserve the structural parallel while allowing each level its specific resonance and maintaining the precision of the fivefold formula throughout.

[16811-16842]
Recognition of the three Dharma-wheels (phyi nang gsang gsum) as progressive unfoldings of the same teaching. External wheel for those with conceptual minds, internal wheel for those with visualization capacity, secret wheel for those with direct energy-body recognition. The five perfections formula remains constant across all three—place, teacher, Dharma, retinue, time—demonstrating that the conditions for liberation are universally present, merely appearing differently to different capacities. Risk of translation: Making the secret wheel sound "higher" or "better" misses the point of skillful means—all three are equal in liberating potential, different only in the perceptual capacity of recipients.

[16843-16914]
Recognition of the gzhi gnas (ground-abiding) wisdom as the basis for all subsequent elaboration. The threefold wisdom structure—ground, sambhogakaya, emanation—mirrors the three-kāya structure precisely, demonstrating that wisdom and embodiment are co-extensive. The fivefold sambhogakaya wisdom (mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharmadhatu) maps to the five Buddha-families, creating a complete mandala of cognition. The twofold emanation wisdom (ji lta ba, ji snyed pa) maps to the classic pramana distinction between ultimate and conventional knowing. The recognition required is that these are all aspects of a single gnosis, differentiated only for pedagogical clarity and recognition purposes.

[16915-16971]
Extended recognition of the three wisdoms as simultaneously present, not sequentially developed. Ground wisdom as ka dag ye shes (primordially pure awareness) abides as the basis. Sambhogakaya wisdom as rang bzhin lhun grub ye shes (spontaneously present awareness) abides as the natural expression. Emanation wisdom as thugs rje kun khyab ye shes (all-pervading compassion awareness) abides as the responsive function. The three are "dbyings dang ye shes lhun grub chen po'i ngang"—the vast spontaneous state of expanse and awareness. This is the Dzogchen view of Buddha-cognition: not something achieved but something recognized as always already present. The translator must preserve the atemporal, non-causal presentation throughout.
