Extended recognition of the five perfections architecture across external, internal, and secret dimensions. The recognition required is that Longchenpa applies a consistent analytical template to three levels of manifestation, demonstrating structural isomorphism across all Buddha-fields. The external five perfections with Vulture Peak location establish the baseline Mahayana pure land formula. The internal five perfections with Akanishta location demonstrate the tantric subtle-body equivalent. The secret five perfections with cremation ground location reveal the most subtle energetic dimension. This is not three different things but one truth seen from three capacity-levels. The translator must preserve the structural parallel while allowing each level its specific resonance and maintaining the precision of the fivefold formula throughout.

Internal and secret five perfections extending the formula to less manifest dimensions. Akanishta as internal place, wrathful heruka as secret teacher. This is the tantric extension of Mahayana pure land cosmology. Register shifts to Guhyagarbha-style visualization. Risk: The threefold division (external/internal/secret) appears redundant without recognizing progressive subtlety. Preservation: Each level represents different capacity recipients, not hierarchical superiority. The internal dimension serves yogins with subtle body practice capacity, while the secret dimension serves those with direct recognition of energetic wisdom.

Recognition of the gzhi gnas (ground-abiding) wisdom as the basis for all subsequent elaboration. The threefold wisdom structure—ground, saṃbhogakāya, emanation—mirrors the three-kāya structure precisely, demonstrating that wisdom and embodiment are co-extensive. The fivefold saṃbhogakāya wisdom (mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharmadhatu) maps to the five Buddha-families, creating a complete mandala of cognition. The twofold emanation wisdom (ji lta ba, ji snyed pa) maps to the classic pramana distinction between ultimate and conventional knowing. The recognition required is that these are all aspects of a single gnosis, differentiated only for pedagogical clarity and recognition purposes.

Extended recognition of the three wisdoms as simultaneously present, not sequentially developed. Ground wisdom as ka dag ye shes (primordially pure awareness) abides as the basis. saṃbhogakāya wisdom as rang bzhin lhun grub ye shes (spontaneously present awareness) abides as the natural expression. Emanation wisdom as thugs rje kun khyab ye shes (all-pervading compassion awareness) abides as the responsive function. The three are "dbyings dang ye shes lhun grub chen po'i ngang"—the vast spontaneous state of expanse and awareness. This is the Dzogchen view of Buddha-cognition: not something achieved but something recognized as always already present. The translator must preserve the atemporal, non-causal presentation throughout.
