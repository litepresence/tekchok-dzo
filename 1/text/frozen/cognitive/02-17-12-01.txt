Verbal view discriminations (tshig gi lta ba) enumerate seven conceptual formulations: primordially free from action, naturally liberated without effort, progressive guidance through superior intelligence, transcendence of virtue and vice, great non-doing and non-arising, unmodified self-purity, and self-arisen self-liberation. Each captures a dimension of Dzogchen view through progressive refinement. These formulations serve as navigational tools—accurate descriptions that point toward recognition without constituting recognition itself.

[3624-3638]
The seven discriminations represent comprehensive classifications of Dzogchen Great Perfection view. Verbal view encompasses conceptual formulations that approximate direct recognition through philosophical precision. Meaning view refers to the actual face-to-face encounter with awareness itself, beyond conceptuality. The boundary between them marks the transition from intellectual understanding to direct perception.

Nine progressive views correspond to the nine yānas, organized in fourfold schema: outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed. Outer view examines phenomena (chos can) through eight stages of mind's discrimination. Inner view recognizes nature and characteristics as illusion. Secret view perceives karmic connections as chains of dependent origination. The unsurpassed view recognizes the suchness of expanse and rigpa as non-dual. This structure demonstrates Dzogchen as culmination while maintaining the validity of progressive refinement.

The four aspects of nature view include: abiding view—samsara and nirvana primordially beyond suffering; pure-seeing view—transcending cause, effect, effort, and achievement; nature view—appearance and existence naturally liberated; and unfabricated view—great expansive openness beyond extremes. Each aspect addresses a specific dimension of fixation, demonstrating completeness through multiple entry points rather than single philosophical formulation.

[3694-3705]
The boundary of general view relates to individual realization versus verbal formulation. The boundary of verbal view is mental discrimination (yid dpyod). The meaning view transcends discrimination entirely. The Thalgyur citation establishes this framework: words function as causes of expression and thought, leading to conceptual understanding that must eventually be transcended through direct perception.

[3706-3708]
Recognizing one's own view as action-free spontaneous accomplishment means recognizing what is primordially present rather than achieved. This innate recognition dissolves the duality between practitioner and path. The view is not something to be attained but something to be acknowledged—always already the case, requiring only the removal of obscuring misconceptions.

[3603-3623]
The seven verbal discriminations progress from negation to affirmation: freedom from action establishes non-doing; effortless liberation emphasizes naturalness; graduated guidance accommodates different capacities; transcendence of virtue and vice dissolves ethical fixation; non-doing and non-arising addresses causal assumptions; unmodified self-purity recognizes innate purity; self-arisen self-liberation culminates in spontaneous freedom. This progression mirrors the path from conceptual understanding to direct recognition.

[3631-3638]
The fourfold schema of outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed views represents progressive penetration of appearance. Outer view examines the manifest world, finding no independent nature in phenomena. Inner view investigates the nature of mind itself, recognizing its illusory display. Secret view perceives the interconnection of all appearances through dependent origination. Unsurpassed view transcends even these distinctions, resting in non-dual recognition.

[3640-3669]
The nature view in four aspects addresses fundamental dimensions of experience. Abiding view establishes the ground—samsara and nirvana as primordially pure. Pure-seeing view dissolves the need for purification through effort. Nature view recognizes spontaneous liberation rather than achieved liberation. Unfabricated view opens into boundless expanse beyond conceptual boundaries. Together these aspects provide comprehensive coverage of potential fixation points.

[3694-3705]
The boundary between verbal and meaning view represents a crucial transition in practice. Verbal view operates through conceptual discrimination, gradually refining understanding. Meaning view transcends concept entirely, resting in direct perception. The Thalgyur passage clarifies this relationship: words lead to thought, thought to discrimination, and discrimination itself must be transcended through direct encounter with what is.
