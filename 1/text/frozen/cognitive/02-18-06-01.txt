Mind training through three views of three kāyas establishing systematic approach to transforming ordinary perception into enlightened vision. Structural function moves from problem—ordinary views do not produce wisdom—through solution—training in three kāya gazes—to detailed description of each view and its effects. Integration of tantric sources provides scriptural authority while practical instructions offer immediate application. Register operates in Mahāyāna and Dzogchen terminology: three kāyas, three gazes, dharmakāya gaze, sambhogakāya gaze, nirmāṇakāya gaze, three realms, samsara, pure realm. Three gazes—downward, sideways, upward—correspond to three kāyas and respective wisdom eyes. Translation risks center on preserving specific correlations between gaze direction and kāya without oversimplification: dharmakāya gaze downward compresses samsara, sambhogakāya gaze sideways destroys existence's ground, nirmāṇakāya gaze downward liberates into Buddha field. Descriptions operate as technical instructions rather than poetic imagery. Three eyes—dharmatā eye, wisdom eye, discriminating eye—must be preserved as distinct technical terms. Practical application establishes three types of practitioners: lazy ones benefit from sambhogakāya gaze, diligent ones from nirmāṇakāya gaze, equanimous ones from dharmakāya gaze. Typology acknowledges different capacities while affirming path's accessibility. Etymological note on "gzigs" as seeing dharmatā and "stangs" as liberating from samsara preserves Tibetan terminological analysis.

Object crucial points—external and internal expanse objects—establishing contemplative supports for three-gaze practice. Structural function moves from external space to internal focus, presenting two complementary approaches. External expanse object is empty space free from clouds; internal is Brahma aperture between eyebrows supporting expanse-appearance. Register maintains spatial terminology: external expanse, internal expanse, empty space, Brahma aperture, expanse-appearance, five colors. Citation from Thalgyur tantra establishes scriptural basis while describing practical method of holding external space. Translation risks center on distinction between external and internal objects: external serves as arising field for awareness, internal serves as field for experience enhancement. Statement that they are non-dual establishes saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixture, technical term indicating essential unity. Warning that taking coarse elements as objects prevents liberation establishes need for subtle focus, indicating advanced practice requirements.
