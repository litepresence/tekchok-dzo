Foundational training for bardo recognition through union of daytime practice and dream-state familiarity. Text presents graduated approach where practitioners first stabilize recognition of illusory body and clear light during waking hours, then extend recognition into dream state. This methodological progression serves as preliminary groundwork for actual bardo instructions that follow. Arrangement reflects standard Dzogchen pedagogical structure: establishing view through daily practice before addressing intermediate state. Fourfold instruction—not abandoning existence, not constructing non-existence, not fixating on presence, not contriving absence—establishes middle way beyond conceptual elaboration. Additional directives regarding past, future, and present experiences constitute "training in appearances without trace" characterizing this tradition. Mirror-reflection metaphor captures essential view: phenomena appear while lacking inherent existence, like reflections in mirror displaying without substantiality. Preservation note: dissolution imagery—clouds clearing in space, water merging with water—represents traditional contemplative metaphors for non-dual recognition requiring careful preservation to maintain specific technical resonance within Dzogchen literature.

Actual bardo instructions proper presenting dissolution sequence of elements at death. Follows standard progression from preliminary training to direct application. Text describes sequential dissolution of earth into water, water into fire, fire into wind, wind into space, and finally space into clear light, culminating in recognition of four wisdoms. Structural arrangement mirrors universal Buddhist presentation of death process while incorporating Dzogchen-specific recognitions of clear light mother-and-child union. Perspective integrates Completion Stage dissolution process with Dzogchen recognition. Convergence of upper HAṃ and lower A at heart center represents union of red and white essences, generating non-conceptual clear light of bliss and clarity. Four wisdoms—appearance, increase, attainment, and near-attainment—appear sequentially yet are recognized as spontaneous wisdom display. Recognition enables practitioner to either achieve liberation in clear light or, if recognition fails, recognize bardo illusory body of meditation deity. Technical terminology for dissolution stages requires precise rendering: terms like "wisdoms" refer to specific stages of subtle mind dissolution, not general wisdom qualities.

Sugata intention meditation presenting ocean-settling method as culmination of meditation practice. Establishes framework for continuous practice without distinction between day and night. Structural progression moves from metaphorical basis (ocean eye water essence), through method (unblinking gaze), to result (six sense-fields liberated into vastness). Arrangement serves as practical application manual for view previously established. Perspective articulates Dzogchen meditation approach known as "ocean-settling"—resting without meditation, viewing without viewer. Sun-moon union imagery represents inseparability of appearance and emptiness, non-duality of day and night practice. Instruction to gaze without blinking establishes direct perception of rigpa without conceptual interference. Resulting state, where appearances arise as objects of perception without grasping subjects, represents "six vastnesses liberated" meditation of great perfection tradition. Preservation note: multiple scriptural citations—from Talgyur, Letterless, and Six Expanses—establish authoritative basis for meditation instruction serving both as validation and practice supports.

[3517-3574]
Result of Sugata intention meditation: arising of dharmatā as ground-settled view. Structural arrangement presents fruition as spontaneous liberation of afflictions into pristine wisdom, representing completion phase of meditation framework demonstrating how practice matures into recognition. Multiple quotations from Six Expanses establish textual foundation for this spontaneous liberation view.

[3575-3615]
View of cutting continuum of city establishing recognition of one's own view as foundation for continuous practice. Presents four subdivisions: view itself, its essential point instruction, its intention, and its result. Fourfold structure provides comprehensive framework for view recognition applicable throughout all activities. Progression from view to result establishes complete path within single recognition. Perspective presents threefold recognition: outer phenomena as appearance without self-nature (seen through vajra eye), inner dharmatā as absence of self-nature (seen through wisdom eye), and secret rigpa as non-duality of expanse and rigpa. Threefold schema encompasses complete Dzogchen view—from conventional appearance of phenomena to ultimate recognition of non-dual awareness. Metaphor of mountain peak view captures comprehensive scope: from summit, all lower valleys visible simultaneously, while from below, summit remains unseen.

[3616-3692]
Term "secret rigpa" refers to non-dual recognition of expanse and awareness, not hidden or esoteric teaching. Technical usage requires precise rendering to avoid misinterpretation as concealed instruction. Threefold liberation outcomes—superior practitioners achieving buddhahood in this life, intermediate in bardo, last as natural emanation bodies—represent standard soteriological framework in Dzogchen literature establishing graduated path while maintaining view that all are equally expressions of natural liberation.

[3765-3851]
Essential point instruction of mountain peak settling method demonstrating how comprehensive view enables simultaneous recognition of all vehicle intentions. Structural arrangement establishes practitioner as one who sees all from peak while others cannot see this perspective. Metaphor captures Dzogchen self-understanding as summit of all paths. Subsequent presentation of great liberation of three realms establishes scope of recognition. Perspective presents spontaneous liberation of afflictions without abandonment or transformation. "Afflictions settled in their place" view represents Dzogchen approach to emotional transformation—not through suppression or transformation, but through recognition of empty nature. Multiple quotations from Six Expanses enumerate how various afflictions and perceptions self-liberate when recognized as mind's display establishing non-dual ethics of tradition where conventional distinctions dissolve into natural purity.

[3901-3950]
Preservation note: catalog of self-liberating phenomena—desire, hatred, ignorance, and various sense objects—follows traditional Buddhist enumerative structures serving as meditation supports and recognition frameworks, requiring preservation of comprehensive scope. Concluding identification as "person who has abandoned dharmas" refers not to nihilistic rejection but to transcendence of fixation characterizing complete recognition.
