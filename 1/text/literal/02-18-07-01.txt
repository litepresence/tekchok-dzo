[4747] First vision dawn not-desire
[4748] Later dawn definite coarse entity like knowing also that-with compatible arise emptiness thought not-existing experience within not-dawn

[4749] Sky empty awareness empty gaze cause
[4750] Field sky compatible experience empty clear radiating-gathering separate vast one dawn cause
[4751] Entity characteristic separate purpose existing
[4752] From Mind Section
[4753] Yogin sky bird-path abide
[4754] Thus said and
[4755] From Collection
[4756] Meaning that what sky-only gaze make
[4757] Thus said and
[4758] From Middle Mother
[4759] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[4760] Sky yogin making said etcetera scripture immeasurable
[4761] That-also field outer-inner mixed equal limitless view called
[4762] Dhatu-awareness non-dual view called
[4763] Dhatu-awareness mixed samsara-nirvana taste equal view called
[4764] This same Instruction-Child from also
[4765] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner
[4766] Obscuration-doer separate sky-like
[4767] Thus spoken
[4768] Third wind-awareness main-point
[4769] Field and gate two meet time wind slow rely awareness capture called
[4770] That-also wind somehow slow outer far shoot outer hold place main-point
[4771] That also wind and slow cause
[4772] Outer yogin life extend helper become
[4773] Inner conceptuality cease cause make and
[4774] Secret awareness direct seeing action do
[4775] Actual contaminated not-seeing buddha make cause
[4776] That thus also from Thalgyur
[4777] Wind what slow make
[4778] Fully project from arising cause
[4779] Body and mind connection cut that
[4780] Three-realms in also reverse not
[4781] Thus said and
[4782] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4783] Fully project from arising cause
[4784] Body and mind connection cut that
[4785] Three-realms in also reverse not
[4786] Thus said and
[4787] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4788] Thus it is said
[4789] Awareness main-point hanging-cord dhatu fence place not-move make

[4790] That same from
[4791] Self-face awareness hanging-cord
[4792] Going-coming separate sky capture
[4793] Thus said and
[4794] From Instruction-Child
[4795] Dhatu inside hanging-cord
[4796] Place arrange separate not-do
[4797] Thus it is said
[4798] That-also wind slow rely action separate meaning mind-in arise
[4799] Awareness hanging-cord forehead gaze cause conceptuality source exhaust-from
[4800] Delusion base return wisdom mother-son meet
[4801] Awareness wind separate-from going-coming not-existing awareness self-arisen enter
[4802] That also guide cause body main-point rely days five-six do
[4803] Then gate practice that much only do
[4804] Then field seek days six seven make
[4805] Then direct self-point deliver experience take
[4806] That very purified meditation knowing arise
[4807] Other wrong not-wrong cause vision flickering see
[4808] Faith not-existing guide finish time what say not-thing divination various arise near therefore thus not-gone pure make
[4809] That general guide great-this apply time preliminary measure arrive diligence with purify cause actual main faith ordinary not-existing arise
[4810] Actual main point-deliver hit direct delight special arise
[4811] Subsequent support dharma end cut explain cause experience practice maintain capable know-from doubt and conceptuality end dharma other mind not-desire purpose existing
[4812] Second direct awareness self-face introduce
[4813] Awareness vajra hanging-cord golden thread sky hovering like dhatu luminous-clear vision with this not-deluded buddha pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance
[4814] State look cause concept-doer all pure elaboration-free sky-like resonance within dawn cause
[4815] Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom meet-face

[4816] First Samantabhadra capacity equal
[4817] This habituation measure arrive stone-with light liberating
[4818] Not-arrive also bardo or nature emanation field traverse
[4819] Six-realms delusion precipice cut
[4820] Thus introduce and
[4821] From Self-Arising Instruction
[4822] Thus who see person
[4823] First Samantabhadra and
[4824] Capacity itself equal
[4825] Thus said and
[4826] From Thalgyur
[4827] Hanging-cord nature
[4828] Conceptuality all pure cause
[4829] Not-deluded base buddha
[4830] Thus it is said
[4831] Third that-from vision dawning manner show
[4832] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning and
[4833] Hanging-cord point tiny bind and
[4834] First white pure star scatter like from
[4835] Point color five possess and
[4836] Each-one and
[4837] Three-bind interval vision until that
[4838] Previous from
[4839] Then point see
[4840] Thus it is said
[4841] That-also outer luminous-clear look cause inner conceptuality separate equal limitless liberate
[4842] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance and
[4843] Spontaneous-completion light-resonance two outer-inner pair connect cause
[4844] Dhatu-awareness gathering-separate not-existing intent called
[4845] Third vision four dawning sequence two
[4846] Essence briefly show and
[4847] Nature extensively explain
[4848] First
[4849] Vision four all time body posture abide
[4850] Eye gaze manner gaze
[4851] Wind-awareness mode slow three main-point harmonize
[4852] Particularly vision first two purify later two effort rely mode purify
[4853] Luminous-clear liberate therefore dhatu-awareness non-dual called
[4854] These main-point awareness vajra hanging-cord separate not-do main-point arise
[4855] That meaning explain
[4856] Awareness essence nature compassion three not-differentiable base-abide and that resonance light channel pure vision from golden thread like coil curve interval point bind
[4857] Vajra buddhas sentient-beings all essence good-bad not-existing equal unchanging abide part place

[4858] Lu example water channel good from water increase decrease not-existing emerge similar
[4859] Body and wisdom increase opening various path-vision complete until that from dawning cause
[4860] Gu that inside dharmata not-mistaken view and meditation pull cause
[4861] Rgyud samsara-nirvana pervade vision those collections from
[4862] Body and
[4863] Point radiate and
[4864] Arise and
[4865] Gather etcetera clear cause
[4866] From Thalgyur
[4867] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[4868] That-from vision four become
[4869] Dharmata direct vision cause
[4870] Intellect grasp view suppress
[4871] Experience-vision above increase cause
[4872] Delusion vision cease cause
[4873] Awareness measure arrive vision cause
[4874] Three-bodies realize path-vision transcend
[4875] Dharmata exhaust vision cause
[4876] Three-realms samsara stream cut
[4877] Thus it is said
[4878] That-also vision four number determine outer sun-moon time four increase decrease and
[4879] Inner body speech mind four binding-from liberate and
[4880] Secret empowerment four determination show and
[4881] Actual lamp four vision determine rely four determine
[4882] Sequence determine
[4883] First base dharmata direct not-see remaining three dawning base not-existing basis and supported base first dharmata direct vision dawning
[4884] That same dawn cause dharmas all meaning see self-arisen wisdom self-from find called
[4885] Then direct that experience not-experience word only fruit not-arise cause
[4886] Meaning experience cause that experience above increase arise
[4887] Thus experience arisen measure firm make need
[4888] Not-firm experience end not-existing dharmas possess not-existing and
[4889] Buddha expand cause not-arise cause
[4890] Experience firm measure arrive cause

[4891] Awareness measure arrive vision arise
[4892] Awareness vision measure arrive though that-from other not-change three-bodies fruit desire difference not-existing
[4893] Actual vision mark dharmas fruit meaning hope ordinary and difference not-existing cause
[4894] Vision experience base dissolve
[4895] Subtle coarse vision holding cease-from
[4896] Pure dharmata exhaust experience dharmata exhaust vision arise
[4897] Those also first two nirmanakaya
[4898] Measure arrive sambhogakaya
[4899] Exhaust dharmakaya vision path make three-bodies path-vision dawn fruit dharmata exhaust pure dhatu arrive cause
[4900] Self-vision potency three-bodies awareness mode dissolve cause
[4901] Awareness pure fruit
[4902] Awareness dhatu-from originally self-potency three-bodies dawn fruit function called
[4903] Vehicle other name also not-hear essence
[4904] Vehicle king intent called
[4905] Main-point this realize difficult one
[4906] Second individual nature extensively explain four
[4907] Dharmata direct
[4908] Experience above increase
[4909] Awareness measure arrive
[4910] Dharmata exhaust vision extensively explain
[4911] First two
[4912] Direct general connection place and
[4913] Self characteristic identify
[4914] First general direct conventional term famous direct and
[4915] Ultimate dhatu meet direct two from
