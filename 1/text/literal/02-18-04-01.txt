[4541] Who dharmakaya abiding manner
[4542] Person who body main-point
[4543] That with compatible who knows
[4544] This dharmakaya great-bliss in
[4545] Yogin pure makes
[4546] Thus it is said
[4547] Thus three-bodies postures done three-bodies intent from not-transgressing
[4548] That also nirmanakaya hunched future time asceticism relying liberating sign
[4549] Sambhogakaya elephant future time doing-without spontaneous-completion mode liberating sign
[4550] Dharmakaya lion future time genuine fearlessness liberating sign
[4551] Elemental body gaze three-bodies gaze into liberating what
[4552] Three-bodies luminous-clear self-in existing heart-in abiding
[4553] Gaze done self-in thus existing intent three manifest making
[4554] Three-bodies self-constituent existing self gaze three-bodies gaze into going
[4555] Body elemental cold greater nirmanakaya with harmonize cold-warm balanced
[4556] Hot greater dharmakaya with
[4557] Balanced sambhogakaya with harmonize auspicious
[4558] Particularly vision increasing swift
[4559] Body posture not-bend body channels heart-in awareness self-resonance existing not-arising that not-raise outer sky-in awareness vision not-dawn therefore gaze precious
[4560] Ordinary like abiding awareness actually dawning impossible
[4561] Dawn time ordinary abiding increase impossible moreover again decreasing gaze precious
[4562] That also snake limbs body-in existing though not-manifest bend manifest like gaze main-point from awareness dawning also thus
[4563] Then posture three alone determined one or
[4564] Two or
[4565] Three or else hundred-thousands etcetera become what meaningful

[4566] Sentient-beings all afflicting-three by three-realms into lead cause that from liberating cause therefore three determined
[4567] Afflicting-three from body speech mind three ripening-by also three determined
[4568] That also first samsara karma wheel from
[4569] Desire impure from form into ripening
[4570] Bird form emerged action and doer speech chief becoming
[4571] Body into ripening time also speech in delight
[4572] Object chief making desire great
[4573] Desire in delight one comes
[4574] That same pure path into taking cause
[4575] Sambhogakaya posture shown
[4576] Sentient-beings such supreme sambhogakaya posture always do
[4577] Dharmata meaning supreme expert
[4578] Also samsara wheel from delusion impure from form into ripening is pig emerged
[4579] That same latency producing sentient-beings mind chief form into ripening
[4580] This form into ripening time mind change many intellect change conceptuality great
[4581] Speech in not-delight
[4582] Always sleep in delight comes
[4583] That dharmakaya posture in always abide
[4584] Dharmata time three abide determined
[4585] Also first aversion impure from form ripening
[4586] Snake ripening body action chief form into emerging
[4587] This body action in delight moving-desire
[4588] Body strength great body coarse
[4589] Body grooming in delight body emerged
[4590] This nirmanakaya posture in always abide buddha determined
[4591] Therefore posture three determined
[4592] Sentient-beings destiny body speech mind three into emerged
[4593] Those binding from liberating cause therefore three alone determined
[4594] That from more not-needed
[4595] Few incomplete therefore three alone determined
[4596] This time speech main-point speech cutting

[4597] From Thalgyur
[4598] Speech training and abiding and
[4599] Swallowing firm making
[4600] Thus said
