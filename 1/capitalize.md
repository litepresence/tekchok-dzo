# Capitalization Standards for Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod
# Last Updated: 2026-02-10
# Purpose: Ensure consistent capitalization across all translation layers

## CAPITALIZATION PHILOSOPHY

Capitalization in Dharma translations follows these principles:
1. **Respect**: Honor the sacred by capitalizing proper names and titles
2. **Clarity**: Distinguish technical terms from generic descriptions
3. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform standards throughout
4. **Readability**: Avoid excessive capitalization that distracts
