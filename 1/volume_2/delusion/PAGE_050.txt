[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [SUBTLE BODY MATERIALISM]

MISREADING:
The subtle body (channels, winds, essences) is a subtle physical body, like an energetic anatomy.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Body" suggests physical structure. New age subtle anatomy.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Reification of subtle body as quasi-physical.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the wisdom-dimension of subtle body.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].
