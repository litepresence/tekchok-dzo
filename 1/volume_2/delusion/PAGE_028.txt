[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [LUMINOSITY AS LIGHT]

MISREADING:
Luminosity ('od gsal, prabhasvara) refers to actual physical light or electromagnetic radiation.

WHY IT ARISES:
"Light" terminology suggests physics. "Clear light" invites literalization.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Experiences of light literalized as physical phenomena.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Missing the metaphorical nature of light imagery.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR].
