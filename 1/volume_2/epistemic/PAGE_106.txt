[RISK: BLESSING REIFICATION]

<The threefold blessing-bestowal (*byin rlabs*) structure marks definitive Dzogchen transmission. The statement: through Dharmakaya's blessing (*de'i byin rlabs kyis*), wisdom is directly seen (*ye shes dngos su mthong bas*)—definite in this (*'di nyid la thag chod*); through Sambhogakaya's blessing, self-clarity is seen (*de'i byin rlabs kyis rang gsal du mthong bas*)—knowledge expands (*mkhyen pa rgyas*); through Nirmanakaya's blessing, seeing without sound-words (*de'i byin rlabs kyis sgra tshig dang bral bar mthong bas*)—all hearing-contemplating-mediating, dharmata's meaning dawns from within (*thos bsam sgom pa la rag ma lus par chos nyid kyi don khong nas 'char ro*). This is not sequential reception but simultaneous dimensions of single recognition. The "blessing" (*byin rlabs*) is not external infusion but the collapse of apparent separation between recognizer and recognized: when recognition occurs, it is not that something new appears but that what has always been present is recognized. The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) viewing: (1) Dharmata's eye turning upward (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog pas*) clears latencies downward (*bag chags thur la sel ba'i gnad*), indicating that transcending dualistic gaze naturally clears habitual patterns; (2) Wisdom's corner looking evenly (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas pas*) balances saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as same taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam du bsre ba'i gnad*), indicating that recognition sees samsara and nirvana as not two; (3) Prajñā's looking downward (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas pas*) actually settles wisdom-appearance (*ye shes kyi snang ba dngos su 'bebs pa'i gnad*), indicating that wisdom-display naturally manifests without effort. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of blessing reification: treating "blessing" as external power transmission rather than recognition of what has always been present.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE EYES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: CAPACITY DETERMINISM]

<The determination of three seeing-modes (*gzigs stangs gsum*) operates from *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for different practitioner capacities. The question: "What makes three definite?" (*gzigs stangs gsum du nges pa ci yin zhe na*). The answer: lazy ones need Sambhogakaya (*le lo can la longs sku*), diligent ones Nirmanakaya (*brtson 'grus can la sprul sku*), equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture (*btang snyoms can la chos sku'i gzigs stangs*), therefore three are definite (*shis pas na gsum du nges so*). This establishes that the three seeing-modes are not sequential stages but skillful-means matching practitioner's predominant capacity (*dbang po*). The definition (*nges tshig*): by seeing, looking at dharmata (*gzigs pas chos nyid la gzigs pas*), obscurations are exhausted (*rnam dag sgrib pa zad pa'o*); by posture (*stangs kyis*), one liberates from samsara (*'khor ba las grol bar byed pa'o*). The phrase "obscurations exhausted" (*sgrib pa zad pa*) refers to recognition-elimination: when recognition sees dharmata, obscurations are not removed but recognized as never having existed. The phrase "liberates from samsara" (*'khor ba las grol*) refers to recognition-liberation: samsara is not exited but recognized as self-liberated display (*rang grol). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of capacity determinism: treating "lazy," "diligent," and "equanimous" as fixed categories rather than recognition-condition descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all three seeing-modes are ultimately pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The three modes are different pedagogical approaches for different habitual patterns, not hierarchical stages of attainment.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: ANATOMICAL LITERALISM]

<The detailed explanation of object-gnad (*yul gyi gnad*) operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement: object-gnad is (1) outer expanse's object (*phyi'i dbyings kyi yul*)—empty space free from clouds (*nam mkha' stong pa sprin dang bral ba*); (2) inner expanse's object (*nang gi dbyings kyi yul*)—the treasury between eyebrows (*smin mtshams kyi mdzod spu*)—expanse-appearance blue and the five radiating from it (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*). The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Expanse is outer and inner—outer holds cloud-free sky (*phyi ni sprin bral mkha' la 'dzin*); when dust-rain clears, wise ones press the gnad (*bag rdul char gyis dengs dus su mkhas pa mngon gsum gnad gzir dang*); inner lamp makes path (*nang gi sgron ma lam du bya'o*)." This establishes the structure: (1) Outer object: sky without clouds—pure awareness-expanse; (2) Inner object: lamp between eyebrows—subtle energy focus; (3) The "pressing gnad" (*gnad gzir*) occurs when coarse defilements clear, not through effort. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "treasury between eyebrows" as literal anatomical location rather than recognition-coordinate. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" (*phyi*) and "inner" (*nang*) are conventional designations, not actual separate spaces: both refer to dimensions of single awareness. The phrase "expanse-appearance blue and five radiating" (*dbyings snang mthing ga dang de las mched pa rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*) indicates the natural display of awareness as five colors, not visualizations to create.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: OBJECT-GNAD DUALISM]

<The definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition's non-duality. The explanation: outer is the object where rigpa dawns (*phyi rig pa 'char ba'i yul yin la*), inner is the object where experience increases (*nang nyams 'phel ba'i yul te*); because rigpa and experience are non-dual (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pa las*), it is called "saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa zhes bya'o*). This establishes that outer and inner are not separate: the object of recognition (*yul*) is not something other than recognition (*rig pa*) and experience (*nyams*). The warning: placing object on coarse earth-water-fire--air objects (*sa chu me rlung gi dngos po rags pa la yul du gtad pas*) will not liberate (*mi grol te*)—first, appearance does not want to dawn (*dang po snang ba 'char du mi 'dod*); later, when dawning, even knowing as coarse objects (*phyis shar dus gtan kyang dngos po rags pa ltar shes pa*), produces agreement with that (*de dang mthun pa skye bas*), so emptiness-unthinkable experience does not dawn from within (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams nang nas mi 'char la*). This is crucial: if one grasps at coarse physical objects as the object of gnad, recognition cannot occur because coarse objects are already solidified by dualistic perception. The phrase "emptiness-unthinkable experience" (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams*) refers to the direct recognition beyond concept (*rtog pa*) of emptiness (*stong nyid*). Risk of object-gnad dualism: treating "object" (*yul*) as something external to recognize rather than awareness's own display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" and "inner" are pedagogical designations pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The "mixing" of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*) is not a mixing of two separate things but the recognition that they were never truly separate.>
