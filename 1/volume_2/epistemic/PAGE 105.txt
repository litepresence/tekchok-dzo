[RISK: SUBTLE BODY REIFICATION]

<The citations establishing the necessity of oral transmission and subtle body practice operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The *Rang byung rig pa'i tantra* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra) citation—"Thus, by thoroughly pressing all body-points etc. (*de ltar lus la sogs pa yi gnad kun rab tu gzir ba yis*), rigpa itself directly (*rig pa nyid dang mngon sum du*)—known from guru's oral transmission (*bla ma'i lung las shes pa yin*)"—establishes that gnad-pressing (*gnad gzir*) is not mere technique but preparation for direct recognition through authentic lineage. The *Thal 'Gyur* elaboration—"Actual basis relied upon in one's continuum (*dngos gzhi rang gi rgyud bsten na*), body-point and speech and mind-point relied upon (*lus kyi gnad dang ngag dang yang sems kyi gnad la brten pa yis*), wind somehow made slow (*rlung ni ci nas dal byas te*), excellently projected (*rab tu 'phang pa*), from this body and mind's connection severed (*lus dang sems kyi 'brel chad de*), not reversing even in three realms (*khams gsum du yang zlog pa min*)"—describes the mechanics of subtle body practice (*rtsa rlung thig le*) within Dzogchen context. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from physical-energetic preparation. Risk of subtle body reification: treating "pressing gnads" and "making wind slow" as manipulations rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "body-mind connection severed" does not mean eliminating connection but recognizing that they were never truly separate; "not reversing in three realms" indicates that recognition transcends samsara/nirvana duality.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: THREEFOLD ESSENTIALIZING]

<The concise definition of the three gnads operates from definitive *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition. The statement—"Door is three-kaya eyes seeing (*sgo ni sku gsum mig gis blta*), object is free from obscurations (*yul ni sgrib byed bral ba'o*), slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*)"—provides definitive recognition-coordinates: (1) Door (*sgo*) refers to the three kayas as the three ways awareness sees itself—not external forms to visualize but awareness's own display as trikaya; (2) Object (*yul*) refers to whatever is perceived being free from obscurations (*sgrib byed bral ba*)—not that objects lack veils but that recognition sees all appearances as already free; (3) Slow wind-rigpa (*rlung rig dal ba*) refers to the natural settled state of subtle energy (*rlung*) and awareness (*rig pa*) when not agitated by dualistic grasping, which naturally accomplishes wisdom (*ye shes 'grub*). The phrase "slow" (*dal ba*) indicates natural settling, not forced suppression. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of threefold essentializing: treating "door," "object," and "wind-rig" as separate entities to master rather than recognition-aspects of single awareness. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these three are not sequential: the "door" is awareness seeing, the "object" is what awareness sees (which is itself), and "slow wind" is the natural state of awareness's energy. All three point to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated.>

[RISK: VISUALIZATION MISUNDERSTANDING]

<The detailed instruction on door-gnad—the first of the three gnads—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The opening statement: ordinary seeing-mode (*tha mal pa'i lta lugs*) does not dawn wisdom (*ye shes mi 'char bas*), therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes (*sku gsum gyi gzigs stang gsum la bslab*). This establishes that ordinary perception is not wrong but incomplete for recognition; the three-kaya seeing-modes are not new ways to see but recognition of how awareness has always seen. The *Dpal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (Glorious Space-Equal Tantra) citation describes three kayas' functions: (1) Dharmakaya seeing-mode (*chos kyi sku yi gzigs stangs*)—pressing the three realms' samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba spyibs na 'don*), meaning seeing all samsara as already pressed into dharmata; (2) Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*)—samsara's basis not destroyed (*srid pa'i gzhi ma 'jig*), indicating that recognition sees without destroying appearances; (3) Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*)—liberating into buddha-fields (*sangs rgyas zhing du sgrol*), indicating manifestation-liberation. Additional citations: *Yi ge med pa* (Scripture Without Letters): "Eye is examined in space-element" (*mig ni nam mkha'i khams su brtag*), indicating that the eye itself is examined as space-expanse; *Gsang ba sgra rgyud* (Secret Sound Tantra): three seeing-modes—casting down, turning back, and glancing (*phab dang zlog dang zur gyis ni gzigs stangs rnam pa gsum du grags*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "three-kaya seeing" as visualizations of forms to see rather than recognition of awareness's own seeing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these "modes" are not sequential practices but descriptions of how recognition sees: all three kayas are simultaneously present in recognition.>

[RISK: ABILITY-TYPE DETERMINISM]

<The detailed application of three-kaya seeing based on practitioner's eye-quality operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The clarification—casting down Nirmanakaya awakening (*sprul sku phab nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at trainees (*gdul bya la gzigs la*); glancing at Sambhogakaya awakening (*longs sku la zur gzigs nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at realms (*zhing khams la gzigs pa*); turning back Dharmakaya awakening (*chos sku bzlog nas sangs rgya ba*) looks at basis (*gzhi la gzigs pa'o*)—indicates that each kaya-emphasis serves different pedagogical purpose: (1) Nirmanakaya casting-down (*phab*) directs gaze downward toward beings needing guidance; (2) Sambhogakaya glancing (*zur*) directs gaze sideways toward pure realms; (3) Dharmakaya turning-back (*bzlog*) directs gaze inward toward the basis. The instruction for different eye-qualities: (1) For those with poor eye-sight (*mig shas ngan pa*), following Nirmanakaya seeing-mode prevents eye-obscuration (*mig mi 'grib pa'i dgos pa yod*); (2) For those with eye-fault (*mig la skyon chags*), following Sambhogakaya mode makes eye clear (*mig gsal ba'i dgos pa yod*); (3) For those with good eye-sight (*mig shas bzang*), following Dharmakaya mode quickly places appearance onto measure (*myur du snang ba tshad la phebs pa'i dgos pa yod*). The definitive statement: "If not moving from those, three eyes certainly enter into interior (*de dag las ma g.yos na spyan gsum khong du chud par nges te*)"—establishes that without wavering from these modes, recognition occurs. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of ability-type determinism: treating eye-quality as fixed category rather than recognition-condition. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "three eyes entering interior" refers to recognition's self-introduction, not physical eye-training. The phrase "Dharmakaya has dharmata-eye" (*chos sku la chos nyid kyi spyan yod pas*) indicates that Dharmakaya seeing is recognizing dharmata, not looking at something called dharmata.>
