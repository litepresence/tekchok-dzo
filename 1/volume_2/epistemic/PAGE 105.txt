[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Masterful analysis:
The *Rang byung rig pa'i tantra* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra) citation—"Thus, by thoroughly pressing all body-points etc., rigpa itself directly—known from guru's oral transmission"—establishes the necessity of direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) through authentic lineage. The *Thal 'Gyur* elaboration: actual basis relied upon in one's continuum, body-point and speech and mind-point relied upon, wind somehow made slow, excellently projected—from this body and mind's connection severed, not reversing even in three realms. This describes the mechanics of subtle body practice (*rtsa rlung thig le*) within Dzogchen context. The door (*sgo*) is three-kaya eyes seeing; object (*yul*) is free from obscurations; slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*). The Dzogchen view recognizes that these are not sequential "steps" but simultaneous recognition: the "door" is awareness's own capacity to see, the "object" is its own unobstructed nature, and "slow wind" is the natural state of subtle energy when not agitated by confusion. The oral transmission (*lung*) is not information transfer but the guru's recognition transmitted as blessing (*byin rlabs*)—direct pointing beyond words.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TECHNICISM]

<Masterful analysis:
The threefold instruction on door, object, and wind-rig's gnad marks *sems*-side pedagogy. Door: ordinary seeing-mode does not dawn wisdom, therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes. From *Dpal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (Glorious Space-Equal Tantra): Dharmakaya seeing-mode—the three realms' samsara pressed/crushed; Sambhogakaya—samsara's basis not destroyed... [page continues]. Risk of technicism: treating "three-kaya seeing-modes" as visual techniques rather than recognition-coordinates. The Dzogchen integration: these "modes" are not methods to apply but descriptions of how recognition sees—Dharmakaya-seeing sees all samsara as already pressed into emptiness; Sambhogakaya-seeing sees without destroying the basis. The practices are *upāya* for those whose recognition benefits from structured approach, but the definitive view recognizes that seeing has always been three-kaya, never ordinary.>
