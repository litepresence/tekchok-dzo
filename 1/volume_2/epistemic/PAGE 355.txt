[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GRADUAL CERTAINTY]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<That self-appearance known, gradually certainty obtained—seven. Twenty-one kadag liberated, not-yet-dissolved between, emanation spread, kadag dissolved. The enumeration of seven stages and twenty-one moments is instructional provisionality, describing the process of recognition for those who require gradual unfolding. Risk of temporalization: mistaking these numerical markers as ontological realities rather than pedagogical scaffolding for practitioners of varying capacities. The view remains Dzogchen—primordially complete—but the path accommodates gradual recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – MOMENT-MEDITATION EQUIVALENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CONCEPTUALIZATION]

<Twenty-one moments equal, but meditation's days many-few exist, senses sharp-dull placed. Those days moments joined, senses' appearance-mode and days' enumeration, emanation's division manner different. From Self-Arisen: some white color liberated, some yellow color liberated, some red color liberated, some green color liberated, some blue color liberated, some five colors liberated, some bindu light liberated—that is final liberation manner. The various colors and bindus indicate different recognition modes, not hierarchical stages. Final liberation manner is definitive—each path leads to the same recognition.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FINAL LIBERATION MODE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ELITISM]

<Final senses' liberation manner thus: final ground obtained—fourteen days taken. That is final ground. The specification of fourteen days for the final ground serves as a temporal marker for the completion of recognition. Risk of elitism: creating hierarchies of practitioners based on time-to-recognition rather than understanding that all recognition is equally primordial.>
