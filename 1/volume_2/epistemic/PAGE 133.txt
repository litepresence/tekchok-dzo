[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
That reversed, outer delusion-appearance ceases; inner body-mind warmth arises. Two palms pressed to ground, moving wind karma-wind reverses. That reversed, outer thigle and thigle-particles appear; inner day-night without experience arises. Kidney heart slightly pleased, grasping karma-wind reverses. That reversed, outer body's appearance seen; inner wind's movement exhausted. Dharmakaya's abiding mode also: sound explained—lion potency three complete, whoever not fearing like, body crucial point that three realms' fear dispelling. Meaning's manner divided: controlled continuum's crucial point—body dog-crouch sitting, expanse and rigpa meet; soles pressed to ground, various conceptions cease; hand fingers' joints contracted, feet two's inner side inserted, karma and afflictions' movement empties; upper body hollow-chest placed, always dharmatā not separate; root kidney pressed, dharmatā's meaning support nonexistent support made. Second, rest wisdom's crucial point: two soles ground placed, knee slightly outward placed, dog-crouch sitting—pervading-effect karma-wind reverses. That reversed, outer wisdom's direction pure appearance seen; inner afflictions' continuum piece-by-piece ceases. Two palms inner side inserted, grasping's karma-wind ceases. That ceasing, outer wisdom's appearance seen; inner grasper object-possessor's conception continuum ceases. Upper body hollow-chest placed, kidney erecting, projecting karma-wind reverses. That reversed, outer wisdom's direction pure appearance seen; inner afflictions' continuum ceases. That also Dharmakaya's abiding mode pressed, Buddha's knowledge this itself complete. The Dzogchen view: these "pressings" and "reversals" are not physical manipulations but recognition that wind-mind's movement has always been wisdom's display.>
