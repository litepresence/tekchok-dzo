[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Direct pointing at primordial purity without progressive mediation. "Self-appears by itself" and "previously unknown" mark recognition-event rather than knowledge-acquisition. Rhetorical questions ("Who hasn't seen this has dull eyes") function as challenge to recognition, not claim about perception. Five afflictions as "awareness self-arises" collapses samsara-nirvana distinction from the rigpa side. Epistemic stance: declarative pointing at self-evident nature—risk of reifying "primordial" as temporal origin.>
