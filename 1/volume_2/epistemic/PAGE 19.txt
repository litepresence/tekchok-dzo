[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMBHOGAKĀYA'S FIVE-FAMILY DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

Longchenpa presents five families' (*rigs lnga*) individual mandalas as non-mixed, clear resonance. From Self-Arisen: marks and signs, radiant light rays, father-mother-body's characteristics held, Sambhogakāya body's marks.

[CONTEXT] NYINGMA-SARMA POLEMICS: The five-family (*rigs lnga*) mandala structure distinguishes Nyingma presentation from Sarma (*gsar ma*) tantric systems. While Gelug (*dge lugs*) and Sakya (*sa skya*) emphasize the five Buddha-families as purified aggregates (*phung po lnga*) following *Guhyasamāja* (*gsang 'dus*) exegesis, Longchenpa's *snying thig* tradition treats the five families as spontaneous display (*rang shar*) of awareness without transformation (*sgyur med*). This reflects the fundamental Nyingma distinction between causal (*rgyu*) and result (*'bras bu*) vehicles—the five families are not achieved through purification but recognized as always-already present. The "father-mother-body" (*yab yum gyi sku*) refers to method-wisdom (*thabs shes*) inseparability, distinct from lower tantra's gradual generation-stage (*bskyed rim*) visualization.

Epistemic precision: This is not cosmological geography but direct pointing to awareness-display. Risk: Reification—reading five-family mandalas as metaphysical locations rather than wisdom-aspect recognition.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE MODES OF SAMBHOGAKĀYA]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION / NIHILISM]

Appearance-mode (*snang tshul*): from one nature rigpa, Dharmakāya body sends light-body to ten directions benefiting. Rigpa body unmoving from dharmadhātu, without change or transformation, self-appearance clear light field—two perfections inside-outside. Citation: "One nature two essences, Sambhogakāya's appearance."

[CONTEXT] DOXOGRAPHICAL DISTINCTION: The three-mode (*tshul gsum*) presentation—appearance, abiding, and emanation—derives from *snying thig* tantras, particularly *Rig pa rang shar* and *Sgra thal 'gyur*. This structure contrasts with standard Yogācāra three-kāya theory by asserting Sambhogakāya as Dharmakāya's self-recognition (*rang ngo shes*) rather than intermediate state between empty Dharmakāya and form Nirmāṇakāya. Longchenpa here follows the *man ngag sde* (Instruction Class) view that Sambhogakāya is immediate (*cig car*) display, not developmental (*rim gyis*) achievement.

Abiding-mode (*gnas tshul*): acceptance-rejection free dharmadhātu, non-dual space, five lights' perfected expanse, emanation's flowing great ring. Risks: Temporalization (appearance as process); Nihilism (non-dual as mere absence rather than clarity-emptiness inseparable).
