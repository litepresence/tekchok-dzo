[DZOGCHEN VIEW – REFUGE AND REBIRTH PREVENTION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: RITUALISM]

<Taking refuge and womb gate bad reversing, good selecting. From Golden Rosary: "Delusion existence's portion, self-appearance nature-lessness appearance, self-appearance nature-lessness knowing, emanation mindfulness self-liberated." The instruction to take refuge and select good rebirth is provisional—not because refuge is ultimately needed (it is not, in Dzogchen view) but because practitioners at this stage still operate within cause-effect. Risk of ritualism: mistaking these instructions as ends in themselves rather than expedient means for those not yet recognizing primordial completion.>
