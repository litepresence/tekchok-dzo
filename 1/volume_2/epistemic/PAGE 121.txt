[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ATTAINMENT-MENTALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
That itself rim-enclosing wall and individual main retinue appearance—Dharmakaya's purification completely pure measure-reached arising. This is rigpa-measure-reached appearance: preliminary times body's actions and doings' connection measure, afterward non-arising sign. That also: though appearing those appearances from preliminary antidotes etc. crucial point, labeled arisen, they are labelers of separation-result and purification-purifier cause-effect, not produced from that arising—wisdom self-existing radiance's stain obscurations purified through power of appearance. The Dzogchen view: these "appearances" are not produced by practice but revealed through recognition. Risk of attainment-mentality: believing "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) is a goal achieved through antidotes rather than recognition of ever-present wisdom.

The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Rigpa-measure-reached appearance: Sambhogakaya's marks examples clear; uncertain color rainbow from; five families father-mother appearing." And *Bstan bu*: "Likewise body up to: six and ten and five-three; unerringly Sambhogakaya." The individual nature particular explanation: measure-reached definitive terminology generally shown and measure-three particular explained—two. First: rigpa-measure-reached means ground-abiding rigpa manifestly became, path-channel entered, ground-appearance's self-radiance spontaneous present arising-door body-appearance, path-appearance near exhaustion, mandala complete. Measure: first half-body to body's mandala complete. Reached: from that transcended without remainder clearly appearing. These like full moon form—waxing-waning mandala complete, self-face incontrovertible.

Second, measure-three particular explained: outer appearance, inner body measure, secret rigpa measure. First: power-over appearance, pure realm clear-light complete... [continues]. The Dzogchen integration: "measure" is not quantity but recognition's fullness; "reached" is not destination but the realization that there was never anywhere to go.>
