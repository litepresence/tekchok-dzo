[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ULTIMATE DHARMATA KNOWING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: COGNITIVE APPROPRIATION]

<Ultimate dharmata knowing empty and, marks not and, clear light dharma evident. That also from Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body knowing objects, as knowing entity's, mode self's benefit knows, as many tamed's, thought as abides knows, thus compassion's dawning manner, tamed's beings various, tamer body also that much." The knowing is dharmata's self-recognition, not cognition. Risk of cognitive appropriation: treating this as a form of knowledge acquisition rather than empty-clear self-recognition.>
