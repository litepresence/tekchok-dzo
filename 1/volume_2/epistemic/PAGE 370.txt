[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS BODILY PERFECTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MATERIALISM]

<Smell fragrant gentle satisfying not enough, senses' satisfaction qualities all possessing. Color body complete food clothes time one complete. Body's effort-free wind moved going and abiding. Wind bile phlegm gathering diseases not. Limbs eight possessing taste hundred gathering water, drunk satisfying knowing, body also soft. Earth water fire wind elements benefit harm free. Hunger and thirst hot cold suffering dispelled. Desire hatred delusion afflictions, birth's cause not, consciousness spacious. Looking joking hand holding embracing desire free. Satisfaction desire-free always dharma listening. Two obscurations free, birth one only takes. Offering goddesses mind-pleasing auspicious say. The spontaneously perfected body in pure realms has no material limitations. Risk of materialism: mistaking these descriptions as literal physical perfection rather than the freedom from fixation they represent.>
