[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

Citation-based passage from Klong drug pa, Samantabhadra (thugs kyi me long), and tantric sources employs systematic negation of all extremes (mtha' med, yul med, chos med). The epistemic function is deconstructive clearing of conceptual elaborations rather than positive assertion. "Wonder" (ngo mtshar) rhetorical markers indicate direct pointing beyond language. Risk of nihilism if negations are taken as ontological denial rather than pedagogical release from fixation.
