[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AGGREGATES EXHAUSTION]
[DECLERATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISTIC INTERPRETATION]

<Eye form ear sound nose smell tongue taste body touch mind dharmas, aggregates exhaustion nirvana all—who not knows? Aggregates exhaustion buddha confidence complete, aggregates channels exhaustion completely confidence! Aggregates elements exhaustion confidence! From Self-Arisen: "Buddha confidence view dharmakaya, meditation sambhogakaya, conduct emanation, result three kayas essence—not established nature clear light!" The exhaustion of aggregates is not destruction but recognition of purity. Risk of nihilistic interpretation: reading "exhaustion" as annihilation rather than transcendence of fixation.>
