<Masterful analysis:
The verse citation on Dharmakaya's abiding manner (*chos sku'i bzhugs pa'i tshul*)—"Whoever knows the body-point suitable to that, this makes yogis into Mahāsukha Dharmakaya"—operates as *upāya* within definitive view. The "body-point" (*lus kyi gnad*) refers not to anatomical location but to the crucial recognition of body's nature as dharmakaya. The phrase "suitable to that" (*de dang mthun par*) indicates alignment between physical posture and realization. The pedagogical function: providing somatic access to recognition for practitioners who benefit from body-based pointing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that Dharmakaya was never separate from the body—the "abiding" is not something achieved but recognized. The "yogis" (*rnal 'byor*) are those who unite (*'byor*) with reality's nature, not practitioners of technique.>

<Masterful analysis:
The three-kaya posture practice (*sku gsum gyi bzhugs stangs*) marks transition from *sems*-side methodology to definitive recognition. The three postures—sprul sku frog-posture (*tsog pu*) for future austerity-based liberation, longs sku elephant-posture (*glang po*) for future effortless natural liberation, chos sku lion-posture (*seng ge*) for future authentic fearless liberation—operate initially as *instructional provisionality*. The question arises: how does elemental body's posture become three-kaya posture? The answer reveals Dzogchen integration: three kayas abide in heart (*snying la gnas*) as self-existing clear light (*sku gsum 'od gsal rang la yod pa*)—posture practice makes manifest (*mngon du byed*) the three intentions already present. The three kayas are self-nature (*rang chas su yod pas*), so one's own posture becomes three-kaya posture. The correlations—cold elements with sprul sku requiring temperature balance, hot elements with chos sku, balanced with longs sku—are provisional correlations for practitioners whose recognition operates through elemental harmony. The crucial point: without posture control, wisdom's self-radiance in channels is not evoked; without evocation, wisdom-appearance does not dawn in external space. Posture is essential (*gces so*), not as cause but as recognition-condition.>

<Masterful analysis:
The simile of snake's limbs—present in body but not manifest unless coiled—illustrates posture's function: wisdom appears through posture's crucial point (*gnad*), just as limbs appear through coiling. The question about whether three postures are definite or can be one, two, three, hundred, thousand—points to the definitive view: the number is pedagogical, not ultimate. The Dzogchen integration recognizes that all postures are equally valid recognition-supports; the "three" is *upāya* for structured practice, while definitive recognition transcends posture entirely—available in any position, any circumstance, never dependent on specific arrangement of body.>
