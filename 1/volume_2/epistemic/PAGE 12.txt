[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: METAPHYSICAL LITERALISM]

The teaching on dharmadhatu presents space (nam mkha') as luminous emptiness (stong gsal) rather than mere absence. The ground of awareness (ye shes kyi dbyings) is described as the basis upon which all phenomena are held (gzhi 'dzin), establishing primordial presence rather than conceptual construction. Risk of literalizing these spatial metaphors as cosmological rather than epistemological—these describe the structure of recognition, not physical geography.

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

The five fires presentation belongs to tantric methodology detailing subtle energy systems for transformative practice. The fourfold classification (outer-inner pervading, clarifying, equalizing, accomplishing) provides systematic framework for working with energetic patterns. This operates from transformative rather than view epistemology—the fires are not metaphysical entities but working dimensions of embodied practice. The channels, winds, and bindu presentation functions as practical instruction, not ontological declaration.
