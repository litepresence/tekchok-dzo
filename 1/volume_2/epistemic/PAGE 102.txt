[RISK: DETERMINISM]

<Masterful analysis:
The threefold classification of beings according to affliction ripening operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. Sentient beings, led by three afflictions (*nyon mongs gsum*) into three realms (*khams gsum*), are liberated through three corresponding doorways—body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag yid gsum*). This presents a karmic taxonomy: desire-unpurified ripening into bird-form (action and speech predominant); confusion-unpurified ripening into pig-form (mind predominant); anger-unpurified ripening into snake-form (body-action predominant). The Sambhogakaya posture taught for desire-types, Dharmakaya posture for confusion-types, Nirmanakaya posture for anger-types—these are *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*), meeting practitioners through their predominant karmic pattern. Risk of determinism: interpreting these correlations as fixed destinies rather than recognition-entry points. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "desire," "confusion," and "anger" are modalities of single awareness; the "postures" are not corrective therapies but pointing-devices revealing that all three poisons are wisdom-display when recognized. The phrase "certainly become buddha" (*sangs rgyar nges*) refers to recognition, not temporal attainment.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The detailed phenomenology of each affliction-type—the bird-person's love of speech, fixation on objects, great desire, desire-joy; the pig-person's many mind-changes, mental dullness, conceptual thought, dislike of speech, love of sleep; the snake-person's love of body-action, movement-wish, great body-power, coarse body, love of physical adornment—serves diagnostic function. These are not zoological categories but recognition-maps: by knowing one's predominant pattern, one utilizes the corresponding posture as *upāya*. The Dzogchen integration recognizes that "body, speech, and mind" are not truly separable; each posture addresses all three, but emphasizes one as entry-point. The definitive view transcends even this taxonomy: recognition is available regardless of karmic conditioning, not because of it. The final statement—three postures are definite, not more (superfluous) nor fewer (incomplete)—indicates pedagogical completeness, not metaphysical limitation.>
