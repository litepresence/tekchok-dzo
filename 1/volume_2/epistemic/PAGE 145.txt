[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage presents the systematic negation of all constructs through citations from Mutig phreng ba (Pearl Garland) and other sources. The epistemic stance is negational clearing (dgag pa)—Longchenpa negates coarse and subtle, delusion and purification, grasping and fixation, karma and wind, phenomena and emptiness, development stage and completion stage, view and meditation, conduct and practice, appearance and view, conventions and fixation, and so forth. This is not nihilistic negation but the clearing of false views to reveal what cannot be posited. The passage operates from the rigpa-side where all dualities naturally liberate (rang grol, rang shar). The repeated structure "X reversed, Y reversed" (log, log) functions as a linguistic enactment of the view's transcendence of philosophical positions (grub mtha'). Modern readers risk nihilistic misinterpretation or failing to recognize that this negation is itself provisional.>
