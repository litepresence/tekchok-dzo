[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL EMANATION BREATHING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION]

That time field remembered merely dharmata's blessings birth is, instruction other hidden nothing. Then natural emanation breathing manner: natural two—abiding natural and counted natural. Abiding: primordially this path appearance dwells, ground-appearance spontaneous presence gate's sambhogakaya's four directions appearance. Fields ten center charnel ground fire mountain blazing eleven exist, but here liberation great breathing five recognized. The natural emanation is not a place to go but recognition of what already is. Risk of spatialization: treating fields and directions as actual locations rather than metaphorical pointers.>
