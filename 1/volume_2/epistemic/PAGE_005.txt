[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SOUND AS PATHWAY TO COMMON SIDDHI]
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[RISK: LITERALISM]

Longchenpa cites sGra-thal-'gyur regarding elemental sound-meanings (*'byung ba'i sgra don*) as pathways to common accomplishments (*thun mong gi dngos grub*). The progression: form (*gzugs*) training exhausts body; sound (*sgra*) knows voices; smell (*dri*) accomplishes extracting essence; taste (*ro*) transforms objects into nectar. The gSang-ba-spyod-pa citation adds: training in four elements' sound-meanings accomplishes six races' own-language clairvoyance.

Epistemic stratification: This operates at Tantric transformative level—sound as energetic vibration to be trained (*goms*), not merely intellectual meaning. The claim "training in form exhausts body" asserts correspondence between sensory engagement and somatic transformation. Risk: Literal misreading—practicing looking at forms to "exhaust body," rather than recognizing form-training as nondual wisdom-display.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTS AS MIND-BODY COMPLETENESS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CAUSAL REDUCTION]

The "ten" plus others show samsara-nirvana dharmas present (*tshang tshul*) in yogi's body-mind through three modes: similar-part completeness generally shown; body-mind completeness specifically explained; great symbol certain play demonstrated. Sentient beings' body-mind assembled dharmas—all primordially complete, self-arisen: method-wisdom as father-mother aspects; dharmakaya bodhi as throwing wind aspect; five families primordial resonance as five element seeds; path accumulations as method-wisdom union's entering-equality essence.

Epistemic precision: "Completeness" (*tshang tshul*) here means atemporal saturation, not sequential fulfillment. Body-mind doesn't "become" complete through practice—it is recognized as always-complete. Risk: Causal reduction—reading "father-mother aspects," "throwing wind" as literal anatomy rather than wisdom-display metaphors.
