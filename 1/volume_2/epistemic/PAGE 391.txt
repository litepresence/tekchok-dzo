[DZOGCHEN VIEW – KADAG SEED ABIDING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: POTENTIALITY ERROR]

<Kadag time this actual, who not, part seed's manner abiding. From Six Expanse: "Essence nature and, compassion's appearance pure, childish intellects appearance, essence whatsoever not established, nature appearance aspect clear appearance, compassion's part wisdom two, doer and doing not dawned, dawn appearance intellect level two's for, wisdom activity thus." The seed metaphor describes primordial completion, not potential awaiting development. Risk of potentiality error: treating the seed as potential to be actualized rather than always-already perfect.>
