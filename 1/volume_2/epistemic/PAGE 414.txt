[RISK: POETIC IDEALIZATION]

<As night clearing sky, rabbit-holder rays also light spreads, star cluster center mandala filling, flower Kunda gardens expand like. Intelligence sky essence's light hundred, various wisdom clear radiance spreads, vajra essence path good illuminates, fortune intellect's lotus expand does. Method this Supreme Vehicle essence's lotus garden from, various self-liberated yogis, clear light essence's meaning showed. Stainless light rays thousand possessing thus said. This colophon verse is poetic closure, not doctrinal statement. Risk of poetic idealization: taking metaphors as literal descriptions rather than appreciative expression.>
