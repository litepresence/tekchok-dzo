[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW – OUTER TANTRA CLASSIFICATION]
[PROVISIONAL MEANING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
This passage presents outer tantra vehicles (phyi rgyud)—Kriyā (bya ba), Upāya (spyod pa), Yoga (rnal 'byor)—as provisional meaning within tantric framework. Emphasis on purity visualization (dag pa'i snang ba), ritual cleanliness (gtsang ma), deity-yoga with separation characterizes these vehicles as transformative rather than recognitive. Epistemic function is upāya: gradually elevating practitioners from sutric causality to tantric result. Phyi rgyud maintains dualistic structure (gnyis 'dzin)—pure/impure, deity/practitioner, ritual object/subject—while training in transformation (bsgyur ba). This is drang don in Dzogchen context: necessary preparation for non-dual view of inner tantras.

The transformative view operates through substitution: ordinary perception (tha mal gyi snang ba) is deliberately replaced by pure perception (dag snang). The practitioner visualizes themselves as deity (lha'i bdag nyid), environment as pure land (zhing khams), and activities as enlightened conduct. This is not yet recognition of primordial purity but progressive familiarization (goms pa) with purity. Longchenpa's doxography (grub mtha') positions outer tantras as kriya (action) oriented—emphasizing ritual performance, upāya (conduct) oriented—emphasizing transformed behavior, and yoga (union) oriented—emphasizing identification with deity.

Each represents progressive relaxation of dualism while maintaining methodical structure. Risk of ritualism: mistaking external purity for internal realization, or believing ritual correctness alone produces liberation. Longchenpa presents Kriyā as upāya for practitioners requiring structured practice with clear boundaries. The drang don status is clear: these are methods, not final nature of reality.>

[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Masterful analysis:
Integration of outer tantra with Dzogchen terminology marks Longchenpa's hermeneutical elevation of tantric content. Terms like rang grol (self-liberated), ye grol (primordially liberated), gnas lugs (abiding nature) bridge tantric completion stage toward Dzogchen recognition. However, epistemic status remains instructional provisionality: outer tantra practices described are methods (thabs), not final view. Risk of practice misread as ontology: practitioners may mistake ritual purity and deity visualization for ultimate reality, failing to recognize these as skilful means. Longchenpa's doxography positions outer tantras as preparatory (sbyor ba) for completion stage and Dzogchen recognition.

The subtle shift from transformative to recognitive view occurs through key terminology changes. Rang grol (self-liberated) implies impurity liberates itself without intervention—a Dzogchen principle foreign to outer tantra's deliberate purification. Ye grol (primordially liberated) asserts liberation was never necessary—directly contradicting outer tantra's gradual path. Gnas lugs (abiding nature) refers to ever-present condition rather than achieved state. These terms function as "Trojan horses"—appearing within tantric context but carrying Dzogchen meaning.

Longchenpa's skill: elevating tantric vocabulary toward definitive view while maintaining pedagogical accessibility. The practitioner advanced in outer tantra encounters these terms as natural development rather than abrupt contradiction.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TANTRA INTEGRATION]
[DEFINITIVE MEANING] for tantra / [PROVISIONAL MEANING] for Dzogchen
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
Passage culminates in Dzogchen terminology integrating tantric practice: rang grol gyi gdon (meaning of self-liberation), ye grol gyi gnas lugs (abiding nature of primordial liberation), rang grol gyi dgongs pa (intent of self-liberation). These represent definitive meaning of tantra—recognition that purification was never necessary because primordial purity (ka dag) is ever-present. However, within Dzogchen hermeneutics this remains provisional (drang don) because operating through tantric methodology. Epistemic distinction: outer tantras achieve transformation (bsgyur ba), inner tantras achieve spontaneous presence (lhun grub), Dzogchen achieves primordial purity (ka dag)—three degrees of ngo bo gcig (same nature) with different mthong tshul (modes of seeing).

The ngo bo gcig (same nature) principle is crucial: all nine vehicles point to same ground (gzhi) but approach through different capacities (dbang po) and methods (thabs). This prevents hierarchical elitism: Dzogchen is not "better" but more direct—suitable for those with sharp faculties (dbang po rab). Outer tantra remains valid and necessary for those requiring gradual approach (dbang po 'bring). Longchenpa's presentation honors diversity of practitioner capacities while establishing unity of the goal.

The definitive view recognizes all vehicles are upāya—expedient means for liberation—and none are ultimate in themselves. This is the dzogchen view beyond vehicles: not rejecting lower vehicles but recognizing their provisional status from perspective of ground that transcends all vehicles.>
