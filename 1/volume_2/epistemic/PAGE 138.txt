[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR EMPOWERMENTS FOUR CONFIDENCES]
[DECLERATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: RITUALISM]

<Four empowerments' fruit direct becoming arising! Dharmata direct perception body like tortoise-shell vessel—channels slowly abiding. Dzogchen meaning effort-free, body's limbs entered! Pot empowerment elaborate wisdom self-arisen! Increase-above body like diseased person—central wind entered! Secret empowerment non-elaborate wisdom! Measure-arrived body like sinking elephant—mind channels wind obtained! Heart entered prajna wisdom! Four confidences: view confidence, meditation confidence, action confidence, result confidence. The empowerments and confidences are recognition, not ritual transmissions. Risk of ritualism: treating these as ceremonies rather than pointing to natural state.>
