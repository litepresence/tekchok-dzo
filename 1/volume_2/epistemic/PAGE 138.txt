[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
Excellent elaboration all near ceasing, nonexistent—empowerment. This also example confidence, meaning's definite. That also body's ground: four-elements' binding liberation-maker arising, now elements self-continuum returning impossible crucial point. Speech's four: expressed-basis, expressed-condition, expressed-object, expresser four's binding liberated, now expressed word self-continuum speaking impossible. Mind's four: memory, memory-free, unborn, beyond-concept four's binding liberated, now memory-thought object's wheel entering impossible. Thus signs body appearing, face-speech knowing, confidence mind approaching, measure dream captured: diligence's sequence. Excellent dream completely ceasing: great familiarization arising, karma and latencies benefit-harm nonexistent; medium dream dream knowing familiarization definite arising, latencies good-bad conception nonexistent; lower dream good abiding: latencies pure taste-one, abandoning antidote cause-effect karma need. Thus abiding three: Mu tig phreng ba: "Pure expanse abiding; thus rigpa's essence abiding; all appearances abiding." Third, obtainment three arrow-pierced: outer appearance power-obtained, appearing conditions pure realm liberation; inner illusory-body power-obtained, with-obstacles clear-light liberation; secret rigpa power-obtained, wind-mind's delusion exhaustion—meaning's fruition power-obtained near called. That also: "Rigpa arising cause-conditions cease; clear-light arising subtle-coarse cease; expanse-rigpa arising object-mind cease." The Dzogchen view: these "cessations" are not processes but recognition that apparent bindings were never other than awareness's display.>
