[5935-5961]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage presents the culmination of the sixteen stages into the primordially pure ground and the completion of Volume 2's eighteenth chapter on the Luminous Vajra Essence Path. The epistemic stance is rigpa-side definitive—Longchenpa concludes that the sixteen stages are merely the display (snang tshul) of a single ground of awareness-rigpa (rig pa 'od gsal), not actual hierarchical attainments. The statement "to obtain Vajradhara, causal stages are not necessary" (rgyu'i sa sgos su yong mi dgos) marks the transition from all causal vehicles to the result vehicle of Dzogchen. The citation from Kun byed (All-Creating Monarch)—"Not changed, not purified, rigpa spontaneously completes" (ma bsgyur ma sbyangs rig pa lhun rdzogs)—establishes the definitive view. The passage transitions from the path's specific instructions (ngos 'dabs pa) to the general treasury's conclusion, marking a shift from method to view.>
