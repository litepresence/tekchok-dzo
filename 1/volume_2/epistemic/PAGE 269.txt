[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TREKCHO CUTTING THROUGH]
[DEFINITIVE MEANING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
This passage presents khregs chod (Trekchö/Cutting Through)—definitive Dzogchen practice of directly cutting through (chod) all grasping ('dzin pa) and solidity (khregs) of mind. Unlike tantric completion stage (rdzogs rim) working with subtle body energetics, Trekchö operates directly on level of awareness (rig pa)—recognizing all thoughts, emotions, appearances are self-liberated (rang grol) upon arising. Terminology—spros bral (freedom from elaborations), ma bcos (unfabricated), rang bab (self-settled)—represents definitive meaning: no "practice" in conventional sense, only recognition of what already is.

Longchenpa distinguishes Trekchö from all lower methods: no visualization, no mantra, no meditation object—only direct recognition (ngo shes) of awareness's own nature. The khregs (solidity/obstruction) refers to the reification of experience—the belief in substantial existence (rdzas yod) of self, phenomena, and mind. Trekchö cuts through this by direct recognition that all appearances are self-liberated—they leave no trace (rjes ma 'dzin) in awareness.

This is not analysis of thoughts (sutric) or transformation of them (tantric), but recognition of their empty nature from the beginning (ka nas stong pa). The hallmark of Trekchö is freedom from all philosophical positions (spros bral)—no view to maintain, no meditation to perform, only naked awareness (gcer bu rig pa). Longchenpa presents this as the direct path: cutting through all reference points to the reference-free nature of awareness itself.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TREKCHO/THOGYAL NON-DUALITY]
[DEFINITIVE MEANING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: METHOD SUBSTANTIALISM]

<Masterful analysis:
Passage establishes relationship between khregs chod (Cutting Through) and thod rgal (Direct Crossing)—two aspects of Dzogchen practice. Trekchö emphasizes ka dag (primordial purity): cutting through constructs to recognize empty essence (ngo bo). Thögal emphasizes lhun grub (spontaneous presence): direct crossing to luminous nature (rang bzhin) through spontaneous vision (thod rgal gyi snang ba). Epistemically, they are non-dual (gnyis su med pa): cannot have one without other. Risk of method substantialism: treating Trekchö and Thögal as separate practices to perform, or believing one superior.

Longchenpa presents them as two aspects of single awareness—Trekchö is emptiness aspect, Thögal is appearance aspect. The trekchö/thogal dyad mirrors the ka dag/lhun grub structure: primordial purity (emptiness) and spontaneous presence (appearance) are two aspects of single awareness. Trekchö cuts through to the empty essence; thogal manifests the luminous nature. They are not sequential—one does not complete trekchö before beginning thogal—but simultaneous recognition of awareness's two aspects.

Longchenpa's presentation prevents error of choosing one over the other: both are necessary, both are already complete. The definitive view is that there is no "practice" of trekchö or thogal—only recognition that awareness is already trekchö (self-liberated) and already thogal (spontaneously manifesting).>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TREKCHO FRUITION RECOGNITION]
[DEFINITIVE MEANING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FRUITION DEFERRAL]

<Masterful analysis:
Passage culminates in Trekchö fruition ('bras bu): yongs su mya ngan las 'das pa (complete parinirvāṇa), shes pa rnam par mi rtog pa (non-conceptual awareness), chos sku (dharmakāya) recognition. Within Dzogchen hermeneutics, these describe ever-present ground, not future achievements. Definitive meaning is Trekchö fruition already the case—chos sku not produced by practice but recognized through it. Risk of fruition deferral: postponing recognition to future moments, believing "complete liberation" will occur after more practice.

Longchenpa's thog ma'i gzhi (original ground) principle undermines all temporal logic: if ground primordially pure, liberation cannot be achieved in time. The skye bu (person) who practices and chos sku recognized are same awareness—"practitioner" is play (rtsal) of that which is never bound. This is not philosophical idealism but direct recognition: the one seeking liberation is the liberation sought.

Trekchö cuts through the seeker—revealing that there never was anyone bound, nothing to liberate, no liberation to achieve. The yongs su mya ngan las 'das pa (complete nirvana) is not a future event but the nature of present awareness. The signs of stability—loosening attachment, natural virtue, non-conceptual clarity—are not achievements but natural expression of recognition. Longchenpa's definitive presentation: fruition is not result of practice but its starting point—the recognition of what was always the case.>
