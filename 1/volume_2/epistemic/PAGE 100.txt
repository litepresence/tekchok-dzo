[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The Sambhogakāya (*longs spyod rdzogs sku*) posture instruction—relying on elephant-sleep (*glang chen nyal ba*) to enjoy dharmatā and see with lotus eyes—operates within tantric subtle body methodology. The "elephant sleep" position (*bzhugs stangs*) is a specific *asana* from completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices designed to facilitate particular energetic configurations. The lotus-eyes (*padma'i spyan*) refer not to physical eye shape but to the quality of vision that perceives without grasping. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*): the posture serves as support (*rten*) for recognition, not as causal mechanism. The Dzogchen view transcends the need for specific postures while acknowledging their pedagogical value.>

[RISK: MEDITATION AS DOING]

<Masterful analysis:
The etymological analysis (*nges tshig*) of Sambhogakāya deconstructs the compound: *longs* (enjoyment) purifies the five sense-pleasures (*'dod yon lnga*) and introduces into unborn dharmatā (*chos nyid skye med*); *spyod* means direct perception through eye-faculty operates at the crucial point (*gnad*) of dharmatā; *rdzogs* is the method (*thabs*) liberating body aggregates into clear light; *sku* is ripening (*smin pa*) that liberates from saṃsāra. The definition of *bzhugs pa* as abiding in samādhi and *stangs* as crucial point transcending three realms appears to present Sambhogakāya as achievement. Risk of "meditation as doing": practitioners may approach this as a state to cultivate through specific methods rather than recognizing it as awareness's own display (*rang snang*).>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Masterful analysis:
The *gser gyi mkha' lding* (Golden Garuda) citation presents Sambhogakāya as enjoyment of dharmadhātu, dwelling in posture that operates in three kāya-fields (*sku gsum zhing*). This is *upāya* functioning to orient practitioners toward recognition of their own nature as already complete (*rdzogs pa*). The declaration that this represents "supreme body-crucial point" (*mchog tu lus kyi gnad*) and "great yoga principal" (*rnal 'byor che mchog gtsor ba'o*) serves pedagogical confidence-building, establishing that the present instructions represent the pinnacle of practice. The Dzogchen integration recognizes that "enjoyment" is not something one does but awareness's own self-experience without subject-object duality.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Masterful analysis:
The Dharmakāya (*chos sku*) posture instructions from *Thal 'Gyur* present sophisticated subtle body mechanics: soles pressing earth (*rkang mthil gnyis sa la phab pas*) equalizes elements through heat-crucial point (*'byung ba snyoms pa drod kyi gnad*); body leaning in posture (*lus 'gying tshugs su 'dug pas*) stops karma-wind through wisdom-wind projection (*ye shes kyi rlung gi 'phen pa las kyi rlung gnon pa'i gnad*); fingers curled pressing earth reverses outflowing karma-wind; chest hollow exposed facilitates rapid experience-appearance; vital energy dropped at navel ensures inseparability from dharmadhātu-time. These are technical *anuyoga* practices. Risk: reifying channels, winds, and crucial points as anatomical realities requiring manipulation rather than symbolic coordinates for recognition.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The *Thal 'Gyur* verse on Dharmakāya posture—lion's manner freeing from all confusion-fear, seeing with vajra-eye—transitions toward definitive view. The etymology defines *chos* as liberating from body aggregates and *sku* as pure transformation (*rnam par dag pa*) where illusory body (*sgyu ma'i sku*) abides all times; *bzhugs pa* as not departing from samādhi-abiding; *stangs* as liberating from saṃsāra. The definitive Dzogchen recognition: Dharmakāya is not a posture-induced state but awareness's own nature (*rang bzhin*) never departing from dharmatā. The "vajra-eye" (*rdo rje'i mig*) is direct perception without fixation, available in any posture, not requiring lion-posture as causal condition.>
