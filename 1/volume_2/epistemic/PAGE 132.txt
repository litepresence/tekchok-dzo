[NYINGMA TRADITION & LINEAGE HISTORY]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: LINEAGE-REIFICATION]

<The Nyingma tradition (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*) represent two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). The gnad that reliance on such masters (*de ltar pa'i thogs kyis zhag gsum*) guarantees liberation without doubt (*'di'am bar do*)—this is *upāya*: when one relies on masters without doubt, the result is certain liberation (*'di'am bar do*). Risk of lineage-reification: treating "reliance" as faith-based dependency rather than transmission facilitation through recognition.>

[5654-5588]
[SUPREME GURUS & LINEAGE HISTORY]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: DEVOTIONALISM]

<The supreme gurus (*rnal 'byor ma bstan pa*)—these are ultimate authorities. The gnad that such ones have (*rin po che*)—establishes their supreme status (*grub mchog*) and authority (*gnas yod*). The gnad that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—indicates singular focus. The statement that "those who properly practice" (*dam pa'i slar bzhin pa yin*)—this sets up *upāya* for proper transmission without deviation. The gnad that liberation (*'bras pa*)—this indicates that goal is actual liberation (*'bras pa*), not just correct understanding. Risk of devotion-based attainment: treating "liberation from gurus" as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.>

[5588-5599]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION-RESTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: COGNITION-OBJECTIFICATION]

<The recognition-resting teaching (*drangs pa las*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition sees (*mthong ba*) and rests (*drangs pa las*)—this establishes direct recognition without intervening conceptualization. The gnad that therefore afflictions (*dngos pa'i*) exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this is definitive: delusion has never truly existed to eliminate. Risk of cognition-objectification: treating "recognition" as some separate entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its self-nature.>

[5608-5653]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION-GATHERING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The recognition-gathering teaching (*de las so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this is *upāya*: when recognition arises, cognition (*sor rtog pa*) gathers (*gru*) completely (*chad du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba ni*). The gnad that therefore recognition's experience (*nyams*) spontaneously arises (*'phel 'byung ba'o*)—this indicates that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. Risk of reification: treating "recognition-gathering" as metaphysical entity rather than recognition-descriptions of experience modes.>

[5654-558]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION-CUTTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: COGNITION-OBJECTIFICATION]

<The cognition-cutting teaching (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i me tog gi tshom bur 'char ba ni*)—this is provisional teaching for detaching from conceptual cognition. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's precise analysis (*rab tu spel*) through clarity (*rab tu*) skill (*legs pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of cognition-objectification: treating "cognition" as some separate entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its self-nature.>

[5429-5453]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GNAD-LOOKING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: GNAD-OBJECTIFICATION]

<The gnad-looking teaching (*gzigs stangs las 'grus pa las byung ba'o*) operates from *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. The gnad: (*gzigs*) looking (*stangs las*) establishes (*grus pa*) and (*byung ba*)—this indicates that recognition's "looking" (*gzigs*) is key: seeing recognition's own appearance. The gnad that therefore dharmata's wisdom object gathering recognition (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes yul gru tsam du snang ba ni*)—this is provisional describing recognition's relationship to dharmata. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's clarity (*rab tu*) through precision (*spel*) skill (*legs pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of gnad-objectification: treating "gnad" as technique rather than recognition-key.>

[5454-5475]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CLEARING ACTION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: ACTION-REIFICATION]

<The clearing-action teaching (*de las sbyangs pa las byung ba'o*) operates from *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. Therefore action (*de las*) of clearing (*sbyangs pa*) arises (*las byung ba*)—this is provisional teaching that recognition's clearing arises spontaneously. The gnad that established six accumulations all exhausted (*brtson 'grus rab rnams la bar du zhag lnga'o*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes accumulation's exhaustion (*zhag lnga*), this is not a gradual process but definitive recognition. The gnad that established action seeing going completely liberates (*brtson 'grus pa las pad+ma stong ldan du 'char ba ni sngon 'gro 'byongs pa las byung ba'o*)—this is comprehensive: established (*brtson 'grus pa*) action (*pa las*), Padma (*pad+ma*) emptiness (*stong ldan*), seeing (*du 'char ba ni*), going (*sngon 'gro*), completely (*'byongs pa*), liberating (*las byung ba*). Risk of action reification: treating "clearing" and "liberation" as separate practices rather than recognition-description.>

[5476-5480]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-NATURE ARISING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SELF-NATURE REIFICATION]

<The self-nature teaching (*rang bzhin ma bcos pa las byung ba'o*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Self-nature (*rang bzhin*) unmodified (*ma bcos pa*) arises (*las byung ba*)—this definitively establishes that recognition's self-nature is uncaused and arises spontaneously. This is not gradual cultivation (*ma bcos pa*) but natural unfolding (*las byung ba*). Risk of self-nature reification: treating "self-nature" as something to cultivate rather than recognition's uncaused quality.>

[5481-5495]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION-INTEGRATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: RECOGNITION-SEPARATION]

<The recognition-integration teaching (*de las 'khor lo la sogs pa'i rnam pa sna tshogs su snang ba ni sngon 'gro mthar phyin pa las byung ba'o*)—this describes recognition's integration (*las byung ba*) of perception, appearance, and action. The gnad that therefore action of appearance recognition going liberates (*de las dra bar snang ba ni sngon du 'gro ba tshad du phyin pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that when recognition goes (*sngon 'gro*) into appearance (*dra bar*), recognition (*tshad du phyin pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of recognition-separation: treating "recognition" as something separate from appearance rather than recognition's capacity to see its own display.>

[5496-5512]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ORDINARY MIND EXPERIENCE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXPERIENTIALISM]

<The ordinary-mind-experience teaching (*de phan chad ni nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba ste*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for structured path. The gnad that therefore cognition (*rtog pa*)—this is *upāya* indicating that practitioners recognize (*'di dag ni sems kyi sngon 'gro'i dus na*) that experience is not subject to time (*dus na*). The statement that not separate (*tha dad par bslang ba de 'gags pa'i rtags yin no*)—this establishes that delusion (*rtog pa*) and emptiness (*stong*) appear separate but are not different (*tha dad par*). Risk of experientialism: treating "ordinary mind experience" as state to achieve rather than recognition-description.>
