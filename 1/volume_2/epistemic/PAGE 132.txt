[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The passage presents physical postures (steng cha) and wind-channel techniques as methods for purifying obstacles and enhancing wisdom. The epistemic stance is instructional upāya—Longchenpa describes specific body positions (stretching, joining navel, hands folded) and their effects on subtle energies. The language operates at the conventional tantric level, explaining how physical gestures can reverse karmic winds (las kyi rlung). Readers risk mistaking these provisional methods for definitive Dzogchen view or reifying the subtle body structures (channels, winds, drops) as ontologically real. The passage functions within the sems-side framework: these are techniques to stabilize recognition, not descriptions of the nature itself. The mention of Sambhogakāya postures indicates the transitional nature of these practices between tantric transformation and Dzogchen completion.>
