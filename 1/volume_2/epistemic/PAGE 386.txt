[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA WISDOM SEED]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SEED POTENTIALITY ERROR]

<Rigpa wisdom's seed increase-decrease not, rigpa empty-clear wisdom not divided, rigpa holding-free wisdom face-taking extreme free, rigpa concept-free wisdom not-ceased completely clear, rigpa all-clear wisdom not-mixed completely perfected, rigpa all-appearance wisdom clear holding not, rigpa all-clear wisdom clear spontaneous thick. From Self-Arisen: "Jewel measureless palace arrangement good, jewel variously spread lady ornament good." The seed metaphor points to what is already complete, not potential to be developed. Risk of seed potentiality error: treating rigpa as a seed to be nurtured rather than recognizing its primordial completion.>
