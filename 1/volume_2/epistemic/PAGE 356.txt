[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE STABILITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Spontaneous presence three days abiding, final self-appearance seen, stability obtained. Emanation also fifty days benefit can do. Final medium: nineteen days taken, also cluster twelve days, four wisdoms abide. Those beings' senses all Buddha's ground conquered. Those bardos also dream-like. Final natural emanation born, here liberation's class explained. These senses' liberation manner—great importance, should know. The temporal markers (three days, fifty days, nineteen days) describe the duration of recognition stability, not mandatory practice periods. Risk: reading these as required meditation durations rather than descriptions of how recognition unfolds spontaneously.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO DREAM-LIKE NATURE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<General meaning four: existence's bardo, karma's projection continuing, precipice broken, fox inserting. Instructions two: instructions' pointing manner briefly shown, bardo's own face extensively explained. First: existence's bardo dream-like appearance, moment instantaneous objects entering, previous moments self-ceased, trace not found. Now direct-clear appearance exists, hurry-scurry wander whatever thought object moment traversing miraculous powers existing time. This gate seeing ones, bardo's self-appearance face found coming. Ten directions emanation fields mind merely done, dharmata truth's blessings there born, bardo without Buddha. The bardo is presented as dream-like and instantaneous, not as an intermediate state. Risk: reifying the bardo as a literal between-state rather than recognizing it as the present moment's opportunity for recognition.>
