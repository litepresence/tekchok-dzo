[DZOGCHEN VIEW – INTERMEDIATE KARMA]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CAUSAL DETERMINISM]

<Intermediate karma called. Also dharmata truth seen, previous manifest karma not visible, seed exists. Here dream's own time like, intermediate karma subtle future addition merely accumulates, future karma's connection also this cause-result fruit one to one continue, samsara makes. Accumulation manner: special appearance one setting one not-born between accumulated, that force previous appearance not clear. Time consciousness previous-later between. Cause previous manifest not but subtle latency and meditation's part from. Here accumulation above dharmata forgotten, blocked from arose. Karma signs: previous karma purified seed part appearance that time, above dharmata very clear, examined; previous seed not purified, consciousness not clear, dull. Consciousness clear-not clear previous virtue-non-virtue's projection arose. Cause two: clear cause previous-latter mindfulness pure arose; not clear dharmata back turned arose. The intermediate karma operates subtly—not manifest but as latent potential. Risk of causal determinism: believing karma absolutely determines outcome rather than recognizing recognition can interrupt the chain.>
