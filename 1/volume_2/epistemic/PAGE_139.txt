[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR GREAT CONFIDENCES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CERTAINTY AS ATTACHMENT]

<Buddha's qualities heard also obtain hope and thrill not—self-established three bodies complete confidence! Action and afflictions' cause-effect heard also delusion-vision samsara fall fear not—cause-effect transcended confidence! Nirvana's own place seen also liberate hope's joy-thrill not—primordial purity self-complete strong place obtained confidence! Four arising! From Jewel Garland. The four confidences are natural expressions, not attained certainties. Risk: treating confidence as attachment to certainty rather than freedom from doubt.>
