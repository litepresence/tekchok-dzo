[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage presents the direct investigation of mind's arising through analytical meditation. The epistemic stance is rigpa-side investigation—Longchenpa guides the practitioner to search for the mind's origin, location, and destination, finding nothing. The description of mind not arising from self, other, or both, and the analysis of color, shape, signs, and characteristics leading to groundlessness (gzi med) operates as negational clearing. The phrase "mind-made analysis merely groundless, suddenly gone pure" (blos brtags pa tsam gzi med har sang ye dag du song) indicates the collapse of conceptual investigation into recognition. The citation from Thalgyur—"Mind: from where it first arises, where it abides in between, where it finally goes"—establishes this as canonical Dzogchen method. The passage concludes with the non-meditation of the river's continuous flow (chu bo rgyun gyi bsam gtan), marking the transition from investigation to spontaneous abiding.>
