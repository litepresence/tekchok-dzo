[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: INTELLECTUALISM]

<Masterful analysis:
Appearance-mind connection-free unobstructed great seen, dharma-exhaustion's intention mind-exhaustion dawns called. These Arya Ratnakūṭa stated: "Kāśyapa, bodhisattvas mahāsattvas mind thoroughly search diligence undertake."

Memory-knowing's aspects these conditions what relying arising? Conditions nonexistent, memory-knowing adventitious these unreasonable. If mind this body one exists, body destruction time destroyed also destroyed; nonexistent, following going-returning uncertain, body's sickness mind time-comes; birth previous-following wheel coming unreasonable. "Mind" this one, one migration faculty ceases, other migration also dying reasonable; not-one, migration's form different like, migration's mind entity different reasonable; different, body one's within insects etc. creatures all, one person life time done time living reasonable. If one, body one outer inner sentient beings immeasurable coming this what? If mind this returning-place exists, first cause must exist; cause exists, compounded impermanent, again destroying, karma good-bad nonexistent reasonable... [continues].
