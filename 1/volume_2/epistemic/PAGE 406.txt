[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL COMPASSION ENERGY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VOLUNTARISM]

<Beings delusion circling lower classes from, tamed and tamer not suitable, ground abiding wisdom outer appearance dawned. Samsara as long beings' benefit arises, nature energy's compassion deep clear knowing perfect from arose. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Dharmakaya empty nature from, wisdom knowing perfect part, energy beings to dawns, that not samsara nirvana classes, knowing knows and clear, self-knowing clear self-nature from, nature energy's compassion." Compassion is spontaneous energy, not willed. Risk of voluntarism: treating compassion as cultivated or chosen rather than ground's natural expression.>
