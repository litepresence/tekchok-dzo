[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WISDOM NEGATION AND AFFIRMATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CONTRADICTION]

<That wisdom not, beings' benefit and Buddha's dharma immeasurable certainly not become. From Condensed: "Wisdom not, qualities increase not bodhi and, ocean-like Buddha dharma also not become." These wisdom not said, essence whatsoever not established negation. Wisdom existing said, nature spontaneous presence part described, contradiction not, kadag and spontaneous presence non-dual. Second, nature extensively explained: dharmadhatu kadag's dharmakaya's mode wisdom spontaneous presence subtle nature abiding. The apparent contradiction between wisdom's existence and non-existence is resolved in non-dual understanding. Risk of contradiction: taking the negations and affirmations as logical opposites rather than skillful means.>
