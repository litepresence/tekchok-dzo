[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NONDUALITY AS ONTOLOGICAL STRUCTURE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

Longchenpa establishes nonduality not as mystical union but as ontological inseparability. Life-force (*srog*), awareness (*rig pa*), lamp (*sgron ma*), bindu (*thig le*), and prajna (*shes rab*) are not "one" (which would collapse distinction) nor "two" (which would posit duality) but nondual (*gnyis su med*). This is not apophatic negation—saying what they are not—but an assertion of their inherent co-emergence. The epistemic register here is definitive: nonduality is the structure of reality, not a goal to achieve. Risk of reification: readers may hypostatize "nonduality" as a metaphysical property rather than recognizing it as the absence of foundational division.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE AS FUNCTIONAL MANIFESTATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALIZATION]

The five winds producing vitality (*bkra*) and luminosity (*gzi mdangs*) emerge from spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*). Classification: consciousness-producing wind, mind-emanating wind, luminosity-possessing wind, consuming/burning wind, and agitating wind. These are not physiological processes to be manipulated but functional descriptions of how awareness displays. Longchenpa maps them to: prajna's sphere, appearance's sphere, lamp's sphere, non-recognition's sphere, and mind's sphere. The pedagogical intent is to show how the "same" wind operates differently depending on view-recognition. Risk: practitioners may attempt to "work with" these winds as subtle body techniques, missing that they are already-perfect displays requiring no intervention.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PERVASIVE WIND AS GROUND-DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION ERROR]

The five pervasive winds (*khyab byed*) are introduced as "self-arisen" (*rang shar*). The term *khyab byed* (pervasive) risks spatial misreading—suggesting extension through space rather than omnipresence without spatial coordinate. These winds pervade the basis (*gzhi*) not like water soaking cloth but like clarity pervading the clear. Epistemic stance: ground-pervading wind establishes that manifestation is never separate from base. This is not causation (wind causing pervasion) but identity: to pervade IS to be wind, to be wind IS to pervade. No temporal sequence, no spatial container.
