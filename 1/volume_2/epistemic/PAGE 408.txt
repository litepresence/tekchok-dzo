[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-KNOWING THREE WISDOMS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ENUMERATIVE SUBSTANTIALISM]

<Self-abode kadag's dharmadhatu self-knowing clear dharmadhatu pure aspect abiding. From Lamp Illuminating: "Truly perfected Buddha, wisdom aspect three: aspect all knowing, all knowing wisdom, ground abiding wisdom. Emanation body's wisdom two: as knowing mode knows, as many other benefit, sambhogakaya wisdom side's, clear light self-appearance known clear." The three wisdoms describe one self-knowing, not separate entities. Risk of enumerative substantialism: treating the three wisdoms as countable substances rather than aspects of non-dual recognition.>
