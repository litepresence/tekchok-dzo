[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO STAGES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Four days bardo abides. Self-front five clusters clearly dwell seen, self-latency awakened to that, eastern cluster one day abides. Likewise four directions' clusters day each abide. Then spontaneous presence certainty obtained, Buddha. Emanation fourteen days benefit can do. Senses supreme medium: day rising sees, five days sees. Also thus: four days cluster abides, one day wisdom's appearance abides. That self-heart light rays horse-ear like arise, sky's space standing pillar comes. That self-eye not wandering held, looked. The temporal markers (days, stages) are instructional provisionality, not ontological description. Risk: literalizing the temporal sequence as metaphysical reality rather than pedagogical scaffolding.>
