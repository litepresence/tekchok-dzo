[RISK: FRUITION-DEFERRAL]

<Masterful analysis:
The arising of awareness-measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs kyi snang ba byung ba*) marks definitive Dzogchen view: even when rigpa-appearance reaches measure, if it does not change into something other than that, it is not different from considering three kayas as fruition—this is the crucial distinction from common vehicles. The hope for meaning's fruition in apparent marks/signs is common; but here, appearance-experience dissolves into ground, subtle-coarse appearance-grasping ceases, and dharmata-exhaustion-appearance arises through engaging in primordial purity dharma-exhaustion. This is not "attaining" fruition but recognizing its ever-present nature. Risk of fruition-deferral: interpreting "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) as a goal to achieve rather than recognition's own self-display. The four appearances—first two Nirmanakaya, measure-reached Sambhogakaya, exhaustion Dharmakaya—are not stages but modalities of single recognition. Through making them path-appearance, three kayas appear as path-appearance, and fruition dharma-exhaustion primordial purity reaches the expanse. Self-appearance's potency-three kayas dissolve into rigpa's state—this is rigpa-primordial-purity's fruition. From rigpa's expanse, primordially self-potency-three kayas arise and perform benefit—this is the "essence not even heard by name from other vehicles," the "King of Vehicles' intention." The Dzogchen view: fruition was never separate from the ground of recognition.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The fourfold extensive explanation of individual natures begins with the presentation of direct appearance (*mngon sum*), experience-increase (*nyams gong 'phel*), rigpa-measure-reached (*rig pa tshad phebs*), and dharmata-exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba*). This operates as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*), providing cognitive scaffolding through familiar epistemological categories. The detailed analysis of direct appearance includes: general connection-establishment and individual characteristic ascertainment. The four types of direct appearance—conventional direct appearance (five objects appearing to senses), mental direct appearance (causal certainty conceptual object appearance), self-awareness direct appearance (internal bliss/suffering experience appearance), and yogic direct appearance (directly encountering actuality entering suchness, individual correct rigpa and its appearance-object non-dual, free from grasping-grasped experience certainty)—serve pedagogical function. The Dzogchen integration recognizes these "types" as conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for what is ultimately single awareness-display. The definitive view transcends even these four: direct appearance is not "seen" but recognized as awareness's own nature.>
