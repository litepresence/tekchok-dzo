[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

Passage operates at the level of direct recognition (ngo sprad) of primordial awareness (ye shes), employing extensive apophatic negation chains (ma myong series) and expansive terminology (mnyam gdal, phyam gdal). The epistemic stance is non-inferential direct introduction beyond philosophical positions (phyogs ris). Risk of reification exists if "primordially empty" (ye stong) is taken as ontological assertion rather than recognition-instruction. Copper-shining (zang thal) terminology indicates self-illuminating awareness without observer-observed structure.
