[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Masterful analysis:
The description of the expanse of light and color (*'od dang kha dog gi klong*) presents the mandala architecture—center (*dkyil*), retinue (*'khor*), individual aggregates (*so so'i tshom bu*), body, wisdom, father, mother, body-color, hand-emblems—as appearing from secret seed-causes (*gsang ba sa bon gyi rgyu*). This is definitive Dzogchen: appearances are not created but self-arise (*shar ba*) from nature-of-essence (*ngo bo nyid*) as nature-of-essence body (*ngo bo nyid kyi sku*). The mirror-and-reflection simile (*rang dang gzugs brnyan*) encapsulates non-duality: apparent multiplicity is single awareness's self-display. Risk of reification: treating mandala architecture as metaphysical geography rather than recognition-coordinates. The fourfold denial—*rtag pa ma yin* (not permanent), *dngos por med* (not entity), *chad pa ma yin* (not annihilated), *'od gsal sku* (luminous body), *tha dad ma yin* (not different), *phyi nang med* (no outer/inner)—establishes Dzogchen's Middle Way beyond extremes. These are not philosophical positions but direct pointing to awareness's nature transcending conceptual categories.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY] → [DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The presentation of Sambhogakaya taming beings (*longs skus 'dul ba'i gdul bya*) initially operates from *sems*-side pedagogy: individual families and mandalas appear according to the tamed, emanated (*rnam par 'phrul pas*) and oriented toward beings' capacity. The description of Vairocana's ocean-like abiding—outer clarity seen as inner, inner as outer, without front/back through unobstructedness (*zang thal*), face appearing in all directions equally—uses spatial paradox to point beyond dualistic perception. This is *instructional provisionality* preparing for definitive recognition. The Dzogchen turn: the "pure realm ornamentation" (*zhing khams rgyan*), "worlds on lotus palms," "thick pure array," "retinue not different from oneself," "self-arisen wisdom teaching," "time of realized recognition"—all describe awareness's own nature, not external Buddha-fields. The crucial distinction: while appearing as self-display primordially (*rang snang gdod ma*), it is posited as Sambhogakaya complete with marks and examples (*mtshan dpe rdzogs pas*) when considered from the perspective of luminosity-taming (*gdul bya 'od gsal*). This is not two different things but one awareness considered from confusion versus recognition.>
