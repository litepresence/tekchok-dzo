[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUDDHAHOOD WITHOUT GRASPING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<Truly Buddha time's kadag that whatsoever not established, body and wisdom's dharma also not, dawning ground also not. Some say: body and wisdom actually abiding, that not, result's dharmakaya and wisdom not obtained, or obtained then declined. Refutation two: reasoning first, Buddha wisdom not, self-benefit and other benefit not arise, what not sky empty difference not. Second, entity-speak some like, dharmakaya that entity and marks established, coarse like existing. The Buddha's wisdom transcends existence and non-existence. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "not established" as utter non-existence rather than freedom from conceptual extremes.>
