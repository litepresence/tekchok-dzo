[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO RECOGNITION PRACTICE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Senses final final or that above dharmata's bardo dawned but truth's power not obtained, existence's bardo dream-like path arose time, "I died" thinking, recognized. Existence intermediate existence dreamed, remembered. Lama remembered, that instruction remembered, now natural emanation's field going should—thinking merely, previous dharmata truth's blessings and, existence intermediate existence self-power not grasping's stain not, existence's future continuing latency exhausted, that field lotus miraculously moment born, breathed. Sun-moon union from, birth abode subsequently remembered, senses final natural emanation body's field three breathed. The instructions for bardo recognition are expedient means for those who have not recognized primordially. Risk: treating these as ontological descriptions of after-death states rather than skillful means for present recognition.>
