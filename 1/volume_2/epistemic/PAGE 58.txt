<Masterful analysis:
Sophisticated view-ascension from tantric subtle body mechanics (*rtsa rlung thig le*) to Dzogchen recognition. The enumeration of elemental subdivisions and their correlations serves as *upāya*—pedagogical scaffolding that ultimately dissolves into direct pointing. The transition emphasizes that these 'techniques' reveal pre-existing awareness rather than produce new states.>
