[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL EXPRESSION DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CAUSAL ATTTRIBUTION]

<Thus essence kayas three not established, nature five wisdoms not established, compassion emanations not established. Not established from where arise? From ground's power natural expression. Natural expression not other than ground, ground not other than natural expression. Self-appearances ground's play, play not different from player. The display arises spontaneously without cause, not from something other than itself. Risk of causal attribution: seeking a cause for appearance rather than recognizing spontaneous presence.>
