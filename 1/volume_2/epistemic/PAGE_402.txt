[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION BODY DEFINITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FUNCTIONAL REDUCTIONISM]

<Essence, definitive term, division, enumeration four: essence—various not fixed, essence's abiding manner, attachment free, samadhi mind non-conceptual mode equally abiding. Definitive term: whatever tames thus emanated, emanation; that suitable appearance form perfect, body. The definition points to what spontaneously manifests for beings' benefit, not a functional role. Risk of functional reductionism: reducing emanation to mere utility rather than recognizing its nature as ground's display.>
