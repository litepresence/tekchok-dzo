[RISK: PERSONIFICATION]

<Dharma perfected, nature Great Perfection, secret unsurpassed tantra essence seven, time perfected self-conditions pure time taught. Thus indicating teacher emanation body all outer inner secret perfected five five should know. Meaning two: wisdom's abode particular explanation three: essence—self-rigpa's nature elaboration free. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Concept free dharmata self-resonance from, objective-free wisdom appearance dawns." The perfected teacher is the spontaneous display, not a person. Risk of personification: attributing these qualities to an individual rather than recognizing the ground's nature.>
