[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTAL WISDOM CORRESPONDENCE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: ELEMENTAL REIFICATION]

Longchenpa establishes a fivefold correspondence between elemental characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) and awareness-wisdom (*rig pa'i ye shes*). Wind's characteristic of upliftment (*'degs pa*) corresponds with awareness-wisdom free from birth and cessation. Fire's characteristic of burning (*sreg pa*) corresponds with awareness-wisdom unobstructed (*thogs pa med pa*). Water's characteristic of moistening (*brlan pa*) corresponds with awareness-wisdom entering all objects/spheres (*yul kun la 'jug pa*). Space's characteristic of vastness (*yang pa*) corresponds with awareness-characteristic without rupture (*rgya ma chad pa*).

Epistemic function: These correspondences operate pedagogically, not ontologically. The elements don't "become" wisdom; they are provisional descriptors pointing to wisdom-qualities. Risk: Practitioners may attempt to "transform" elements into wisdom through visualization or manipulation, missing that the correspondence is already-established identity, not potential-to-be-actualized.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTAL LIBERATION AS NON-PRODUCTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CAUSAL MISREADING]

The Mu-tig-phreng-ba citation presents elemental liberation (*grol tshul*) through negation: Space liberates as object through pervasion-emptiness; wind liberates as gathering-object's action through appearing without grasped-object; fire liberates as agitating-clear-impurity through ripening-consuming; earth liberates as objectless infinite emptiness through producing-uplifting; water liberates as burning-ripening's action through gathering-moistening.

Epistemic precision: The pattern "X liberates as Y through Z" establishes that liberation is not transformation but recognition of non-production. Elements don't change into something else; they're recognized as never having been produced. Risk: Causal reading—thinking earth's action "causes" liberation, when the text asserts co-identity.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTAL INTERPERMEATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALIZATION]

Twenty-five variations emerge: each of five elements with five aspects (earth-earth, earth-water, etc.). The further citation shows space-wind acts on object; space-fire gathers; space-water burns; space-earth opens opportunity. Epistemic significance: This interpermeation (*du pa*) prevents elemental substantialization. No element exists independently; each contains and is contained by others. This mirrors wisdom's non-dual nature—no wisdom exists as isolate. The twenty-five-fold classification is exhaustive taxonomy for pedagogical completeness, not ontological inventory.
