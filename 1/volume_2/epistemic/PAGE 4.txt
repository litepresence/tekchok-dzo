[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Direct identification of elemental characteristics with awareness-wisdom qualities. Each correlation (earth's solidity = birth/death-free awareness, wind's movement = unobstructed wisdom) operates from the view of spontaneous presence (lhundrub). No hierarchical progression is implied; these are simultaneous aspects of single awareness-display.

[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]

Operates through negation: elements "liberate" not by transformation but by recognition of non-entity. Space liberates space, wind liberates into gathering function—the passage negates need for remedial action. The language of "liberation" here is strictly epistemic (recognition) not soteriological (achievement).

[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Detailed taxonomic presentation of 25-fold elements belongs to completion stage practice schema. The mandala principle (each element containing all five) serves as upāya for visualization and energy work. Risk of reifying the 25-fold structure as ontological reality rather than practice framework. View here is explicitly instrumental—"by training in these distinctions, specific qualities are accomplished."
