[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Direct introduction (ngo sprad) to Samantabhadra equality (kun tu bzang po) and capacity (skal ba). Epistemic stance asserts primordial Buddha-nature (ma 'khrul gzhi yi sangs rgyas) as recognition basis. Four visions (snang ba bzhi) sequence presented as natural unfolding rather than constructed achievement. Risk of practice misread as ontology if visionary progression is reified as objective metaphysical process rather than self-recognition dynamic.
