[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The passage presents sky-gazing (nam mkha'i rnal 'byor) and wind-control practices as methods for recognizing awareness. The epistemic stance is instructional: Longchenpa cites sutric sources (Sangs rgyas phal chen, Sdud pa, Yum bar ma) alongside Dzogchen tantras to validate these methods, positioning them as expedient means within a broader pedagogical framework. The language describes specific techniques (gaze at sky, slow the wind, look at the hanging cord) that operate at the level of conventional cognition and subtle body practices. The passage deliberately functions as upāya—skilful methods to lead the practitioner to recognition, not as definitive statements about the nature of reality. Modern readers risk conflating these practical instructions with Dzogchen's ultimate view, failing to recognize that these are provisional entry points that naturally dissolve upon recognition.>
