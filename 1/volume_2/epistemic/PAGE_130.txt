[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LINEAGE BLESSING AS SELF-LIBERATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DEVOTIONALISM]

"Our supreme gurus Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava—those relying on such supreme ones, this life or bardo without doubt liberated!"

[CONTEXT] LINEAGE HISTORY: Vimalamitra (*bi ma la*) and Padmasambhava (*pad+ma 'byung gnas*) represent the two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). Longchenpa received both streams, integrating them in his *mdzod* corpus. The assertion that reliance on such masters guarantees "this life or bardo" liberation reflects the Nyingma view of lineage blessing (*byin rlabs*) not as external grace but as recognition-support.

Epistemic precision: The phrase "this or bardo" (*'di'am bar do*) establishes the two-fold temporal framework—immediate recognition or recognition during intermediate state. Risk: Devotionalism—misunderstanding reliance on gurus as faith-based dependency rather than recognition-facilitation.

Citation from *gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*: "Inner body exhaustion place reached, fingers and so on thus appearing, this relied-upon elements self-cease! Birth and entering's distinction, all dharmas exhausted self-place, anything grasping not, dwelling thus emanation body! This entering force's power, birth's self-power who obtained? That also that relied-upon, again time thus done, appearance's self-sound rustling, manifest reverse confusion appears! This beings' benefit all does! Awareness equal one thus! Three thousand beings' great transference this accomplishes! Thus gradual and instantaneous body this accomplishes! All body exhaustion measure liberated! All fruit certain! Supreme ground great mandala accomplished!"

[CONTEXT] TANTRIC CITATION: The *gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* (Secret Practice Seed Tantra) belongs to the *rdo rje phreng ba* (Vajra Garland) cycle, cited frequently in Nyingma *snying thig* literature. The "three thousand beings" (*stong phrag gsum*) refers to the cosmic number of sentient beings in traditional cosmology, here liberated through the "great transference" (*'pho ba chen mo*), the Dzogchen practice of consciousness-transference at death.

Epistemic precision: The paradox "appearance's self-sound rustling, manifest reverse confusion appears" (*snang ba'i rang sgra sil skad de mngon du log ste 'khrul par snang*) captures the Dzogchen view that recognition of appearance as self-liberated simultaneously reveals and transcends confusion. Risks: Nihilism—reading "body exhaustion" as literal destruction; Reification—taking "great mandala" as spatial entity.
