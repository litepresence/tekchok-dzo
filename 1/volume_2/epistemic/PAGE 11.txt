[RISK: SEMS/RIGPA CONFUSION]

The text presents primordial purity (ka dag) as the foundational ground where awareness (rig pa) and compassion (thugs rje) are inseparable from the outset. This operates from rigpa-side epistemology where liberation is not achieved but recognized. The fivefold presentation of wind components functions as the manifested expression of primordial wisdom, not as causal accumulations requiring cultivation. Risk of conceptualizing these as separate levels to be assembled rather than dimensions of single primordial presence.

The four branch-winds emerge from the root wind as rays from sun—simultaneous manifestation without causal separation. The text explicitly states these "do not emanate into dimension" (dbying su ma 'phro), remaining as essential manifestation of primordial nature. This negates any interpretation requiring sequential generation or dimensional transformation. Thekaya-wisdom non-duplicity operates from the recognition that transformation occurs "without shift" ( 'pho 'gyur med par).

 kaya, speech, and mind are presented as luminous displays inseparable from awareness itself. The five wisdoms appear as natural expressions, not achievements to be cultivated. Wisdom as fire-sparks (shes rab me long) indicates non-conceptual clarity—direct perception unmediated by mentation. The statement that wisdom "is not deceived by any concept" (ri mor bzhag pa'i shan 'dris ma zin pa'i ye shesshes) establishes this as declarative finality regarding the nature of awakened mind.
