[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SUBTLE ENERGY REIFICATION]

The five spaces presentation continues tantric transformative methodology, detailing subtle dimensions for practice. The presentation of twenty-one pointing-out instructions (ngo sprod nyer gcig) functions pedagogically to develop specific confidence, not as conceptual schema to be memorized. The distinction between "great arising" ( 'byung ba chen po) and "small arising" ( 'byung ba chung ngu) establishes relationship between primordial basis and manifested expression without hierarchical priority.

[RISK: KAYA希混淆]

The citation establishes four dimensions of enlightened basis: basis-kaya (rten sku), tone-light (gdang 'od), support-wisdom (brten ye shes), and activity-mudra (mdzad pa phrin las). The three kayas presentation operates from rigpa-side recognition where kaya is not spatial division but aspects of single awareness-essence. Risk of conceptualizing these as separate entities rather than perspectives on single primordial nature. The text states awareness itself is dharmakaya when free from concept, sambhogakaya when unceasingly clear, nirmanakaya when appearing without fixation.
