[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE SPACES AS GROUND-DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION]

Longchenpa presents five spaces (*nam mkha' lnga*) from spontaneous presence: pervading-all-common space, objectless clear-radiance space, unmixed pure space, indicating-meaning space, and liberating-to-pure-field space. 

[CONTEXT] DOXOGRAPHICAL PLACEMENT: This fivefold classification of space (*dbyings*) distinguishes Nyingma Dzogchen from Sarma traditions. While Gelug (*dge lugs*) emphasizes dharmadhātu as emptiness-of-inherent-existence (*rang bzhin gyis stong pa nyid*), and Sakya (*sa skya*) treats dharmadhātu as object-of-void-cognition (*stong pa nyid kyi yul*), Longchenpa's five spaces prevent reification of any single definition. The "indicating-meaning" (*don mtshon byed*) space specifically refers to the Nyingthig (*snying thig*) tradition of pointing-out instructions (*ngo sprod*).

Epistemic precision: These are not progressively refined "levels" of space but simultaneous aspects of expanse. "Pervading" indicates omnipresence without extension; "objectless" indicates clarity without grasped-object; "unmixed" indicates purity without contrast; "indicating" refers to the pointing-out function central to *snying thig* practice; "liberating" indicates soteriological efficacy. Risk: Spatialization—reading these as nested containers or hierarchical dimensions rather than nondual descriptions of the same expanse.

[STRUCTURE] CHAPTER TRANSITION: From Elements to Supported-Knowledge
[CONTEXT] MDZOD GENRE CONVENTION: This transition from Chapter XV (*rim khang bco lnga pa*) on dependent arising (*rten 'byung*) to the presentation of supported-knowledge (*brten pa shes pa*) follows the classical *mdzod* (treasury) genre structure. Longchenpa here employs the standard Nyingma hermeneutical progression from ground-ontology (*gzhi'i gnas lugs*) to path-practice (*lam gyi sbyor ba*), mirroring the structure of his own *Yid bzhin mdzod* and *Grub mtha' mdzod*. The supported/supporter (*brten pa/rtem*) distinction derives from *Yogācāra* (*rnal 'byor spyod pa*) sources but is reinterpreted Dzogchenically to prevent reifying wisdom as entity while maintaining functional efficacy (*don byed nus pa*).

Longchenpa summarizes: five elements' awareness-aspect gathered are great elements; their support is minor elements. Citation marks end of Chapter XV. Transition: Having established dependent arising (*rten 'byung*), the text now analyzes supported-knowledge in four parts: supported kaya (*rtem sku*), resonance-light (*gdangs 'od*), supported wisdom (*brten pa ye shes*), and activity classification (*mdzad pa 'phrin las*).
