[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Sign (rtags) system for mind liberation using metaphorical descriptions (dpe): earthen jar child (sgrom gyi phru gu), poison thorn (rtsi dug), fever disease (rim nad). The epistemic stance is pedagogical pointing through similes (dpe), not ontological description. Four signs correspond to four visions (snang ba bzhi). Risk of practice misread as ontology if metaphors are interpreted literally as metaphysical truths rather than recognition-supports.
