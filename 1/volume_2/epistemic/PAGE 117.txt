[RISK: EXPERIENCE-FIXATION]

<Masterful analysis:
Knowing-experience (*shes nyams*) is conception, changing, measure unable—imputed conventional aspect, memory different, this shore's concept included. Measuring this is like measuring clouds and concealing—no realization time, seeing not directly arriving. This is appearance experience: seeing five wisdoms' color appearance, transcending saṃsāra's karma's limit grasping object-appearance; seeing expanse's appearance, above that grasping conception's aspect half absent, empty-void grasping reversed, transcending saṃsāra's aspect's three-two; conception-ground-trace self-purifying, grasping-aspect's half appearance individual-character grasping reversed—this is called "grasping-grasped person-phenomena selflessness conception." Briefly: appearance-experiences are five wisdoms' color appearance and expanse's appearance two gathered. Risk of experience-fixation: the detailed enumeration of experiences (upright-standing, spokes arising, boat-cut, piece, cloth appearance) becoming objects of attachment rather than recognition-marks. The Dzogchen view: these "appearances" are not achievements but indicators that confusion's hold is loosening. "Transcending" does not mean "going somewhere else" but recognizing that karma's grasp, conceptual grasp, and self-grasping have never been other than awareness's display.

Increase upward (*gong 'phel*): those appearances increasingly pure, increasingly good, increasingly many. Purification manner generally shown and appearance manner particularly explained—two. First: saṃsāra's binding liberation manner applied, those appearances upright-standing, spokes arising, boat-cut, piece, cloth appearance five complete, obtaining power over five wisdoms' color, five poisons (desire, anger, confusion, pride, jealousy) manifestly moving binding liberated—only latency remains, none other, therefore transcended saṃsāra's half. Then net form, half-net, eye variegated, eye patterned, dining tent house appearance seen—form etc. five aggregates gathered self-made transcended, transcended world's self-three-two (*bdag gsum gnyis*), dharmatā's view pure blessing. Then wisdom actuality pure shape appearance... [continues]. The Dzogchen integration: the "five complete" indicates recognition's fullness, not accumulation of experiences; "liberated from five poisons" means recognition that poisons are wisdom-display, not their suppression.>
