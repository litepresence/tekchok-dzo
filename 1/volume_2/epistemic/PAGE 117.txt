[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WISDOM'S EXPERIENCE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXPERIENTIALISM]

<The wisdom's experience (*shes nyams*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured analysis. The statement that wisdom's experience is mind, because (*shes nyams ni blo yin pas*)—this establishes that wisdom's experience is ordinary cognition (*sems*), not separate awareness (*rig pa*). The analysis: imagination, all (*kun brtags kun rdzob kyi rnam pa can*)—arising (*dran byed tha dad pa*), spontaneously (*tshu rol gyi rtog pas bsdus pa'i phyir*)—this indicates that conceptual imagination (*kun brtags*) arises spontaneously and gathers (*bsdus pa*) through conceptual reasoning (*rtog pa*). Risk of experientialism: treating "wisdom's experience" as attainment rather than recognition of ordinary cognition.>

[5120-5130]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THOUGHT-POISON]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TECHNICISM]

<The thought-poison (*tshod*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. The instruction that this (*'di la*), poison, inserted (*tshod byed na*)—exhausted, settled (*tshod btsugs nas sbas skungs byed pa'i*), like (*'dra ste*)—this indicates that poison (*tshod*) refers to conceptual thought (*rtog pa*) that obscures recognition; the antidote is to exhaust and settle it. The statement that thought (*don rtog pa'i*) time, without, seeing (*dus med de mthong ba*), self-prime, not-placed (*rang thog tu mi phebs so*)—this establishes that recognition (*mthong ba*) sees thought as primordial (*rang thog*) and never established (*mi phebs so*). Risk of technicism: treating "poison-inserting" as formal technique rather than recognition's capacity to see through delusion.>

[5130-5144]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE'S EXPERIENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: APPEARANCE-REIFICATION]

<The appearance's experience (*snang ba'i nyams*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that wisdom-lamp's five-color's display (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog gi snang ba*) seeing (*mthong bas*), samsara's actions all's extreme (*'khor ba'i las kyi mtha' phyed*)—establishes that recognition sees the display as wisdom's five colors without grasping at samsara's extremes. The analysis that expanse's display (*dbyings kyi snang ba*) seeing (*mthong bas*), that's (*de'i*) self-grasping's, object's, extreme (*steng du 'dzin pa rtog pa'i cha'i phyed med pa*), emptiness-exhausted, self-grasping, reversed (*stong chad du 'dzin pa log pas*)—this definitively establishes that recognition sees self-grasping as exhausted by emptiness. Risk of appearance-reification: treating "five-color's display" as visual phenomenon rather than recognition's luminous quality.>

[5144-5155]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMSARA'S APPEARANCE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The samsara's appearance (*'khor ba'i cha*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The analysis: samsara's appearances three, from (*'khor ba'i cha'i sum gnyis las 'das la*), imagination, ground, spontaneously-pure (*kun rtog gzhi gro rang sangs su dag pas*)—this indicates that imagination (*kun rtog*) recognizes ground (*gzhi*) as spontaneously pure (*rang sangs su dag*). The gnad: self-grasping's, object's, appearance (*'dzin cha'i phyed pa snang ba rang mtshan du 'dzin pa log pas*)—recognizing (*gzhi gro*) self-grasping's object as appearance, reversed (*log pas*)—this is the key: appearance appears as self-grasping (*rang mtshan*), but recognition reverses this (*log pas*). Risk of view collapse: mixing definitive "recognizing self-grasping's object" with provisional "imagination, ground, spontaneously-pure"—the former is recognition, latter is delusory view.>

[5155-5170]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AFFLICTION'S LIBERATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The affliction's liberation teaching operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The statement that self-grasping, afflictions and (*'dzin gang zag dang*) dharmata, self-nature (*chos kyi bdag med rtog pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that self-grasping's afflictions are recognized as dharmata's self-nature (*bdag med*). This is *sems-side* analysis: through philosophical reasoning (*rtog pa*), one recognizes that afflictions lack self-nature. The gnad that not-existing, not-attaining (*ma gtogs pa med pas*)—this indicates that what was recognized as affliction never truly existed to attain. Risk of view collapse: mistaking *sems-side* philosophical recognition for definitive Dzogchen recognition—the former is provisional understanding through reasoning, latter is direct recognition.>

[5170-5185]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE SEPARATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: OBJECT-REIFICATION]

<The appearance-separation (*snang ba*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured path. Also (*mdor na*), appearance's experience (*snang nyams rnams*) wisdom-lamp, five-color's (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog gi snang ba dang*) expanse's appearance, two (*dbyings kyi snang ba gnyis su 'dus pa'o*)—this indicates that recognition's experience includes both wisdom-lamp display and expanse's display appearing together (*gnyis su 'dus*). Separating (*gong 'phel ni*)—this is the provisional instruction to analyze appearance's components. All, excellent-ugly-many (*snang ba de dag je bkra je legs je mang la song ba ste*)—this describes how recognition perceives display as various qualities appearing (*song ba*). Risk of object-reification: treating "five-color's display" as objects rather than recognition's luminous quality.>

[5185-5195]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DEMONSTRATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: METHOD-CONCRETIZATION]

<The demonstration (*tshul gyis spyir bstan pa*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured teaching. Appearance, from (*snang tshul gyis*), dividing (*bye brag tu bshad pa la*)—this indicates that appearance is analyzed through demonstration (*spyir bstan*) into separate divisions (*bye brag tu*). Suffering (*dang po ni*), samsara's bonds, from (*'khor ba'i bcings pa las*)—liberation-method (*grol tshul dang*), destroying (*sbyar na*)—this describes that liberation-method is applied to samsara's bonds (*bcings*). Risk of method-concretization: treating "liberation-method" as technique rather than recognition of what was never bound.>

[5195-5210]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GRASPING-TREMOR]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: EMOTION-REIFICATION]

<The grasping-tremor (*'dod chags*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Appearance, also (*snang ba de yang*), going (*gyen 'greng dang*), separating (*rtsibs shar dang*), destroyed (*gru chad dang*), pot (*dum bu dang*)—this describes how recognition perceives grasping (*'dod chags*) as causing (*phyir*) various destructive appearances: going away (*gyen 'greng*), separating (*rtsibs shar*), destroying (*gru chad*), like pot breaking (*dum bu*). People's appearance (*snam bu'i snang ba dang*)—this is *upāya* describing how appearance is perceived by ordinary people. The statement that wisdom-lamp (*lnga rdzogs pas*) five-color's, attaining (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog la dbang thob nas*)—establishes that wisdom-lamp attains (*dbang thob nas*) five-color's display. The analysis: grasping (*'dod chags*), trembling (*zhe sdang dang*), fear (*gti mug dang*), suffering (*nga rgyal dang*)—these are the tremors (*sdang*) and sufferings (*nga*) of grasping (*'dod chags*). Risk of emotion-reification: treating "fear" and "suffering" as metaphysical states rather than descriptions of delusory experience.>

[5210-5225]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – POT-BREAKING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]

<The pot-breaking (*phrag dong lnga*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Seeing (*mngon du rgyu ba'i bcings pa las grol te*)—this is the definitive instruction: recognition sees through the bonds (*bcings pa*) that arise from grasping. The statement that bag, not-existing, not-attaining (*bag la nyal tsam ma gtogs pa med pas*)—establishes that recognition's recognition (*mngon du*) is so subtle that grasping (*'dod chags*) falls (*nyal*) without truly existing or being attainable. The gnad that samsara's liberation, definite (*'khor ba'i phyed las 'das pa nyid do*)—this is definitive: samsara never truly existed to liberate from. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "pot-breaking" as visual technique rather than recognition-metaphor for delusion's collapse.>

[5225-5235]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE-GRASPING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: APPEARANCE-REIFICATION]

<The appearance-grasping (*dra ba*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Therefore (*de nas*), appearance (*dra ba'i rnam pa dang*)—this is the final gnad: recognition of appearance's nature (*rnam pa*). Grasping (*dra ba phyed pa dang*)—this indicates that the grasping (*'dod chags*) is separated (*phyed pa*) from appearance. Eyes, many-distortions (*mig mangs ris dang*)—this is *upāya* describing how ordinary perception (*mig*) has many distortions (*ris*) when grasping at appearance. Appearance, like (*mig tshags kyi rnam pa lta bu dang*)—this indicates that appearance is seen through distorted vision (*mig tshags*) as various (*lta bu*). The gnad is to recognize that appearance's grasping is delusory and appearance itself is luminous. Risk of appearance-reification: treating "appearance" as objects rather than recognition's display.>
