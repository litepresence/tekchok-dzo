[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The passage presents the signs of nearing complete liberation (yongs su mya ngan las 'das pa'i sngal ltas) and the system of thigle (bindus). The epistemic stance is instructional upāya—Longchenpa lists experiential indicators (not wishing to associate with people, feeling one could fly through space, joy at appearances dissolving, no attachment to body and life) as markers of practice maturation. The detailed classification of thigle—body channels, path, and fruition—operates within the sems-side framework of subtle body anatomy. Readers risk reifying these signs as definitive ontological markers or as attainments to be achieved, rather than natural expressions of recognition. The passage also presents thigle classification (kundzang yeshe, zangpo rtsa, zangpo sgron ma, etc.) as pedagogical scaffolding. The transition from signs of liberation to thigle classification marks a shift from fruition indicators to path methods, both operating at the conventional instructional level.>
