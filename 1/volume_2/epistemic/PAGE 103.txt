<Masterful analysis:
The *Thal 'Gyur* (Penetration of Sound) citation on speech training (*ngag bslab pa*)—"Speech is trained, abides, and la bzla is stabilized"—presents graduated *upāya* for practitioners whose predominant pattern is speech/desire (bird-type). The three phases: first, training to speak less, cutting ordinary conversation, beginning with short sessions then longer; abiding in mantras and virtuous speech without rejecting them, yet not mixing words with others; la bzla (transcending speech) where all mantra-recitation ceases; stabilization where nothing is said, not departing from that state, not even using body-gestures. Risk of asceticism: interpreting this as value of silence itself rather than recognition-support. The *Sa bon gyi rgyud* (Seed Tantra) citation: "Speech, however blocked, without any sign-making with anyone—thus, whoever does this, mind's scattering and gathering self-decides." The Dzogchen view recognizes that "cutting speech" is not suppression but recognition that speech has never been other than awareness's self-expression. The "unspeakable meaning" (*brjod du med pa'i don*) arises in continuum not because speech stops but because recognition transcends expression/non-expression duality.>

<Masterful analysis:
The progression from speech-training to body-training to mind-training represents tantric subtle body methodology leading toward Dzogchen recognition. Through cutting speech, unspeakable meaning arises; through not mixing speech with others, body is trained—necessary because without body-training, buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot bless. Body trained as illusory body liberated (*lus sgyu ma'i skur grol*). Through cutting expressed-objects, speech is trained—signs appear, communication with non-human guides (*rtags su mi ma yin pa rnams*) occurs. Through cutting speech-expression, mind is trained—previously unseen non-human forms appear, then clairvoyance (*mngon par shes pa*) dawns piece by piece. This describes tantric accomplishment (*dngos grub*) trajectory. The Dzogchen integration: these "accomplishments" are recognition-marks, not attainments. The crucial instruction on cutting body-mind connection (*lus sems kyi 'brel gcod pa*) through speech-gnad—when body and speech are controlled, mind naturally follows, space-rigpa dawns, element-bonds sever. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation "Mind is accomplished through placing in expanse" (*sems ni dbyings la gtad pas 'grub*)—the definitive pointing: all training converges on recognition that mind has always been the expanse, never separate.>
