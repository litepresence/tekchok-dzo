[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMBHOGAKĀYA AS UNIFIED DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: KĀYA TRINITARIANISM]

Longchenpa establishes Sambhogakāya (*longs sku*) through five aspects unified: some sphere (*yul*), some method (*thabs*), some appearance (*snang ba*), some prajna (*shes rab*)—thus explained as unified Enjoyment Body. Definitive term: perfecting virtues (*yon tan du longs pa*), dwelling in luminosity-purity (*'od gsal dag pa la spyod pa*), both purposes spontaneously complete (*don gnyis lhun gyis rdzogs pa*), wisdom reaching full measure (*ye shes tshad du phyin pa*), mark-simile light-ray appearing body (*mtshan dpe 'od zer snang ba'i sku*). Five "longs" (*longs*) make "complete enjoyment" (*longs spyod rdzogs pa*).

Epistemic precision: The five aspects are not components but simultaneous descriptions. "Sphere" indicates object-pole; "method" indicates subject-pole; "appearance" indicates display; "prajna" indicates recognition; "light-ray body" indicates form. The unification prevents trinitarian reading (three separate kayas) by showing Sambhogakāya as dharmakāya's self-recognition. Risk: Trinitarianism—treating Sambhogakāya as ontologically distinct from Dharmakāya rather than wisdom-display aspect.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE PERFECTS AS SAMBHOGAKĀYA'S DEFINITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALIZATION]

Citation from spontaneous presence: "Dharmatā emptiness's mode dwells—perfect; clear unmixed all-pervading—perfect; five wisdoms unseparated dwelling—perfect; all-unequaled individual marks possessed—perfect; method-prajna unseparated dwelling—perfect." Five appearances markless dwelling—enjoyment; without grasping self-clear all-enjoying—enjoyment; completely clear equal-dwelling—enjoyment; naturally naturally dwelling in sphere emanating—enjoyment; two kayas intended ultimate enjoyment—enjoyment.

Epistemic precision: The repetition of "perfect" (*longs*) and "enjoyment" (*spyod*) establishes Sambhogakāya not as location but as activity—dwelling, pervading, enjoying. The "five appearances markless" indicates that form-display is empty-form, not substantial form. Risk: Substantialization—reading "light-ray body" as physically luminous entity rather than wisdom-radiance without material substrate.
