<Masterful analysis:
Knowing equality great spread; thus vase armpit; wisdom water-stream washing, demigod places emptied, that also human birth-place obtain. Thus following held, sequential places transferred, sequentially life measure short becoming, human place's bliss found. That person's breath not separated, syllable breath with, doubt-free places purify. If breath separated, aggregates' place vase, wisdom water-stream purified, that also doubt not taken. That also: not died signs six arise, those places' syllables contemplated, breath upward drawn, above transferred, vase unnecessary; died corpse's place syllables contemplated, vase washing, transferred. That also: other place born even, ritual blessing, hell etc. those life measure dream dreamt merely, instant and moment and mere instant exhausted, human place born.

"Then migration's lord gods not?" Migration's lord humans, not gods. Human support effort, life one liberation obtain, upward upward place choose exists; gods upward downward falling, life one liberation not obtain; renounced and ordained etc. also support not, common virtue special not accomplish—superior virtue inconceivable what mention. Faults also: gods killed, falling offense's portion heavy not producing; humans killed, birth downward coming. Risk of substantialism: treating these "places" (*gnas*) as ontological locations rather than modalities of confusion; "transference" (*'pho ba*) as literal movement rather than recognition. The Dzogchen view: "hell" and "human realm" are not destinations but descriptions of awareness's state; "transference" is recognition that consciousness was never confined.>
