[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The passage presents the practice of "arrow unmoving" (rgyang zhags 'gul ba med pa) and vision cultivation as methods for recognizing dharmatā. The epistemic stance is pedagogically framed through multiple citations (Yig med, Sgyu 'phrul, Rin chen spungs pa'i rgyud, Thalgyur, Rang shar, Seng ge rtsal rdzogs, Nor bu 'phr bkod) that progressively build toward the direct introduction. Longchenpa speaks from the sems-side here, describing technical practices (three gazes, thigle visions, water lamp) that function as expedient means. The "sixteen visions" (snang ba bcu drug) are presented as progressive experiences that naturally unfold through practice. Readers risk reifying these visionary experiences as ontologically real attainments rather than natural expressions of recognition. The passage operates at the level of method and experience, not at the level of definitive view where all visions are self-liberated.>
