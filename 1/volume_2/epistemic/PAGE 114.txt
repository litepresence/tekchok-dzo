[DZOGCHEN VIEW – UNBORN-GNOSIS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: INTELLECTUALIZATION]

<The Unborn-Gnosis (*yi ge med pa*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The statement that Unborn-Gnosis, fully-awakening by wisdom (*sangs rgyas kun gyi mngon sum*)—establishes that recognition is wisdom's own awakening, not through accumulation. The instruction to see formless-emptiness's pure display (*yul med rnam par dag pa'i snang ba mthong*)—this is *upāya* pointing to recognition's capacity to see beyond form. The citation from *Vajra* (*sgyu 'phrul las*) and Precious-One (*nor bu rin chen*)—this connects to tantras that establish the definitive path. Risk of intellectualization: treating "seeing formless-emptiness" as visual meditation rather than recognizing awareness's formless nature.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE BODIES DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The teaching that The Fully-Awakening all's cognition (*sangs rgyas kun gyi mngon sum pa*) sees three bodies' display (*sku gsum gyi snang ba mthong ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation from *Precious-One, completely-exhausted* (*rin po che rnam par brtsegs pa'i rgyud las*) seeing gnosis (*mngon zhes bya ba mthong ba la*)—this establishes that the three bodies are not attained separately but are seen together as single recognition-display. The statement that three, spheres (*gsum zhes bya ba sku gsum gyi zhing khams gtan la phebs pa'o*)—refers to recognition's capacity to see all dimensions simultaneously. Risk of substantialism: treating "three bodies" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition's display modes.>

[5006-5020]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GNAD-LIBERATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: GNAD-OBJECTIFICATION]

<The gnad-teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement of purpose (*dgos pa ni*): by this gnad, not obscured, liberation (*gnad 'dis gol sgrib med par grol te*)—this establishes that liberation is through recognition-key (*gnad*), not through effort. From that (*de nyid las*), if dharmata-cognition, no gnad (*chos nyid mngon sum gnad med na*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes dharmata directly, there is no separate "gnad" to apply. The instruction that not having eyes, going to the sky (*mig med g.yang khar phyin pa 'dra*)—this is *upāya* describing recognition's lack of dependence on sensory faculties. Risk of gnad-objectification: treating "gnad" as some special technique rather than recognition-key.>

[5020-5038]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE VIEW-STANCES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The three view-stance (*lta stangs gsum*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. The citation from *Thal 'Gyur*: suffering's grasping's destruction-impossible (*rgyang zhags 'gul ba med pa gnad*)—this is the definitive teaching that suffering cannot be destroyed because it never truly existed. The instruction to distinguish (*sbyar*) and that Unborn-Gnosis (*yi ge med pa las*) eyes not needing (*mig ni rab tu gnan bya ste*)—this is provisional: eyes don't need to "not see" because recognition never relies on them. From eyes side, expanse's self-born (*mig zur nyid las dbyings 'byung bas*)—this indicates that recognition's capacity to see is intrinsic to awareness, not acquired. Risk of view collapse: mixing definitive statement "suffering's destruction-impossible" with provisional "eyes not needing"—the former is ontological, latter is pedagogical.>

[5038-5055]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AWARENESS-EXPERIENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: EXPERIENTIALISM]

<The awareness-experience (*rig pa'i dngos po*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The appearance description (*snang ba ni*) from *Thal 'Gyur*: dharmata-cognition, display (*chos nyid mngon sum snang ba ni*)—establishes that recognition (*mngon sum*) is not separate from dharmata-display. The teaching that from affliction's door, established (*dbang po'i sgo las nges 'thon te*)—this is *sems-side* provisional explaining how delusion's function obscures recognition. The statement that Sprin not-having (*sprin med pa*) in space's sphere (*yi mkha' la gsal*)—this indicates that recognition is like space: empty yet able to contain all appearances without obstruction. Risk of experientialism: treating "awareness-experience" as something to achieve rather than recognition of what is already present.>

[5055-5065]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WISDOM-LIGHTS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]

<The wisdom-lights (*ye shes lnga*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The analysis that also, basis and delusion-circle (*gzhan yang rtsa dang 'khrul 'khor gyis*) nature's five-lights (*rang bzhin gnas pa'i ye shes lnga*)—this establishes that awareness's five lights are recognition's own display, not caused by basis or delusion. The instruction that in water-well, eyes seeing (*chu bur migis mthong ba'o*)—this is *upāya* describing recognition's capacity to see its own reflection (like water-well reflecting sky). The statement that from self-born (*rang shar las*) wisdom-lights, having light (*ye shes lnga ldan 'od kyi sku*)—establishes that five lights are awareness's own luminous quality, not external illumination. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "five lights" and "water-well" as visual techniques rather than recognition-descriptions.>

[5065-5080]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VESSEL-HOOK]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The vessel-hook-continuum (*lu gu rgyud*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The instruction that in vessel-hook-continuum, thoroughly-shining (*lu gu rgyud du rab tu gsal*)—establishes that recognition is already luminous in the continuum of form (*lu* = vessel/body), hook (*gu* = connection), continuum (*rgyud* = thread/sequence). The statement that also going and coming (*de yang 'gro dang 'ong ba dang*)—this indicates that recognition's display appears and disappears continuously, like coming and going. The teaching on grasping and destruction (*'gul ba dang ni 'phrig pa'o*)—this is *sems-side* provisional describing delusion's function: grasping at phenomena as "grasp-able" and "destruction-possible." Risk of reification: treating "vessel-hook-continuum" as anatomical structure rather than metaphor for recognition-display.>

[5080-5095]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENG GE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PERSONIFICATION]

<The *Seng Ge* (Lion?) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation from *Seng Ge* (*seng ge rtsal rdzogs las*): self-display (*rang snang*), phenomena (*rig pa'i dngos po de*) in vessel-hook-continuum, abiding (*ye shes gu lu rgyud du gnas*)—this establishes that awareness's phenomena abide within the vessel-hook-continuum of recognition-display. The citation from *Nor Bu Phra* (Precious-One who constructed?) (*nor bu 'phra bkod las*): suffering (*rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma*)—this is *sems-side* provisional describing how delusion manifests as suffering, like carrying heavy burden. The statement that also, in that, yang (*la yang dag par rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas rig pa lu gu rgyud kyi sku yongs su gsal lo zhes so*)—establishes that the Fully-Awakening's awareness in vessel-hook-continuum is thoroughly shining. Risk of personification: treating "Seng Ge" and "Nor Bu Phra" as mystical beings rather than authoritative citations.>

[5095-5112]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EXPERIENCE METHOD]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: METHODOLOGISM]

<The experience method (*nyams su blang lugs*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. The instruction that in affliction and ground, great-quantity (*dang po thun chung la grangs mang du bya*)—this describes that many recognitions (*grangs*) should occur within the context of affliction (*dang po*) and ground (*thun chung la*). The two, three (*gnyis pa la thun bskyed cing yun bsring*)—refers to recognition of two aspects or three aspects with consistency (*yun bsring*). The statement that three (*gsum pa la nyin mtshan med par nyams su blangs zhing*)—indicates that the three recognitions are distinguished without characteristics (*nyin mtshan med*). Risk of methodologism: treating "experience method" as graduated technique rather than recognition-framework.>

[5112-5125]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AWARENESS-EXPANSE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION]

<The awareness-in-expanse-between (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcug pa las*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make (*mi 'gul bar byed de*)—this is the definitive instruction on how recognition rests. The "between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. The instruction to "make not waver" (*mi 'gul bar byed*)—this is not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of spatialization: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.>
