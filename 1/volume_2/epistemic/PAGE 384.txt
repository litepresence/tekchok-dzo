[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMADHI CONTINUITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MEDITATIONISM]

<Continuous samadhi gathering-separation not, dharmata inconceivable samadhi change not. Fourth: self-arisen rigpa inner clear spontaneous presence great abiding, jewel sheath change not abides. These also from Self-Arisen: "Jewel vajra seat change not, jewel empty path termination not, intent self-abiding oral instruction shown." The samadhi continuity is natural, not cultivated. Risk of meditationism: treating this as achieved through meditation effort rather than recognition of natural state.>
