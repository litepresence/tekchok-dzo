[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The threefold blessing-bestowal (*byin rlabs*) structure marks definitive Dzogchen transmission: through Dharmakaya's blessing, wisdom is directly seen (*ye shes dngos su mthong*)—definite in this (*'di nyid la thag chod*); through Sambhogakaya's blessing, self-clarity is seen—knowledge expands (*mkhyen pa rgyas*); through Nirmanakaya's blessing, seeing without sound-words—all hearing-contemplating-mediating, dharmata's meaning dawns from within. This is not sequential reception but simultaneous dimensions of single recognition. The "blessing" (*byin rlabs*) is not external infusion but the collapse of apparent separation between recognizer and recognized. The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) viewing: dharmata's eye turning upward clears latencies downward; wisdom's corner looking evenly balances saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as same taste; prajñā's looking downward actually settles wisdom-appearance. These are not visual techniques but recognition-coordinates: upward = transcending, even = non-dual, downward = embodying. The definitive meaning: lazy ones [need] Sambhogakaya, diligent ones Nirmanakaya, equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture—best, therefore three are definite. This indicates capacity (*dbang po*) differences, not hierarchical stages.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Masterful analysis:
The object-gnad (*yul gyi gnad*) presentation operates from *sems*-side pedagogy: outer expanse's object is empty space free from clouds; inner expanse's object is the treasury between eyebrows—expanse-appearance blue and the five radiating from it. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Expanse is outer and inner—outer holds cloud-free sky; when dust-rain clears, wise ones press the gnad; inner lamp makes path." Risk of reification: treating "outer space" and "inner lamp" as distinct locations rather than conventional designations for dimensions of single awareness. The correlation—outer as rigpa-dawning object, inner as experience-increasing object—serves recognition preparation, not metaphysical geography. The statement "rigpa and experience non-dual, therefore saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed" (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pas 'khor 'das 'dres pa*) points to definitive view: the object of recognition is not something separate from the recognizing. The Dzogchen integration: "object" (*yul*) is none other than awareness's own self-display (*rang snang*); space and lamp are not locations but modalities of single clear-light.>
