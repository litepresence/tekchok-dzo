[RISK: SNAKE-KNOT METAPHOR LITERALISM]

<The citations establishing awareness as self-knotted (*lu gu rgyud*) operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The *Rang ngo rig pa* (Self-Face Awareness) citation—"Self-face awareness like a snake-knot (*rang ngo rig pa lu gu rgyud*), held in sky through free from going-coming (*'gro 'ong bral bas mkha' la bzung*)"—and *Bstan bu* (Display) citation—"Within expanse (*dbyings kyi nang du*), snake-knot (*lu gu rgyud*), arranged (*rnam par gzhag cing*) but not separated (*'bral mi bya*)"—establish the definitive Dzogchen view of awareness as self-arisen and self-coiled, not externally constructed. The commentary elaborates: through slow-wind reliance (*rlung dal ba bsten pas*), the meaning of separation from activity arises in continuum (*bya ba dang bral ba'i don rgyud la skye*); awareness-knot placed in "A" syllable (*rig pa lu gu rgyud ar la gtad pas*) causes conceptual sources to exhaust (*rnam par rtog pa'i khungs zad nas*), delusion returns to ground (*'khrul pa gzhi la log ste*), and mother-child wisdoms meet (*ye shes ma bu phrad pa'o*). The phrase "mother-child wisdoms meeting" (*ye shes ma bu phrad*) refers to the meeting of primordial wisdom (mother) and recognition wisdom (child)—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. The crucial statement: "Awareness separated from wind, without going-coming (*rig pa rlung dang bral nas 'gro 'ong du med pa*), is awareness entering itself (*rig pa la rang byan tshud pa*)." This establishes that recognition is not produced but discovered: awareness has never truly been separate from itself; the apparent separation is wind-agitation (*rlung*), and when wind settles, awareness naturally enters itself. Risk of snake-knot metaphor literalism: treating "snake-knot" as actual entity to unknot rather than metaphorical description of awareness's self-coiled nature.>

[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: GRADUAL PATH ESSENTIALIZING]

<The detailed instruction for preparation (*khrid*) operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The graduated practice description: (1) If guiding (*khrid du byed na*), rely on body-gnad (*lus kyi gnad bstun pa*) for five-six days (*nyi ma lnga drug tu bya'o*); (2) Then apply gate (*de nas sgo spyad pa la*) for just that amount (*de tsam cig tu bya'o*); (3) Then search field (*de nas yul btsal ba la*) from six to seven days (*nyi ma drug nas bdun byas la*); (4) Then place direct actual on threshold (*de nas mngon sum rang thog tu phab nas*) and take as experience (*nyams su len pa'o*). This produces extreme training (*shin tu 'byongs*) and meditative knowing (*sgom shes pa*). The warning: if by mixing and turning (*gzhan du 'al ma 'ol byas pas*) one sees appearance singularly (*snang ba ra ri cig mthong nas*), and when emerging from guidance without conviction (*yid ches med par khrid thon dus*), doubt arises without any speaking (*ci la zer cha med par pra yas pa dag 'byung nye*), therefore do not go that way (*de lta ma song ba dag tu bya'o*). This indicates that mixing practices without proper foundation leads to unstable experiences. The guidance-instructions: when placing this great guidance (*khrid mo che 'di 'debs dus*), go forth with effort to all predecessors (*sngon 'gro tshad la phebs pa brtson 'grus dang bcas pas*), having purified (*sbyangs pas*), conviction arises in actual basis (*dngos gzhi la yid ches thun mong ma yin pa skye'o*)—not ordinary conviction but extraordinary certainty in recognition itself. When placing actual basis (*dngos gzhibs par btab pas*), special joy arises in direct perception (*mngon sum la spro dga' khyad par can 'byung ngo*). The post-guidance instruction: explaining that cutting off dharma extremes (*rjes rgyab chos mtha' chod par bshad pas*), knowing that one can protect experience-taking (*nyams len bskyang thub pa shes nas*), cutting off all doubts (*tshom dang rtog mtha' chod de*), one should not place mind in other dharmas (*chos gzhan la yid mi smon pa'i dgos pa yod do*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of gradual path essentializing: treating the time-durations (five-six days, six-seven days) as fixed requirements rather than flexible guidelines. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these "phases" are pedagogical scaffolding for those who benefit from structure, but the recognition itself is immediate and beyond gradual progression.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VISUALIZATION MISUNDERSTANDING]

<The direct pointing of awareness's self-face (*mngon sum rig pa'i rang ngo sprad pa*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The description: awareness as vajra-snake-knot (*rig pa rdo rje'i lu gu rgyud*), like golden thread hovering in sky (*gser gyi skud pa nam mkha' la lding ba lta bu*), expanse-clear-light-appearance together (*dbyings 'od gsal gyi snang ba dang bcas pa*)—this unconfused buddha (*ma 'khrul pa'i sangs rgyas*), primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance (*ka dag lhun grub kyi rang gdangs*). Looking into state (*ngang la bltas pas*), all concept-creators pure (*rtog byed thams cad dag nas*), beyond elaboration like sky (*spros bral nam mkha' 'dra ba'i gdangs*), radiance dawns within (*nang du shar bas*), knowing the meaning of non-dual expanse-rigpa (*dbyings rig gnyis su med pa'i dgongs pa shes rab*), prajna-born wisdom meets face-to-face (*byung gi ye shes dang zhal mjal*). This is not description of attainment but recognition-instruction: the "snake-knot" is awareness's self-coiled nature, never requiring unknotting; the "golden thread in sky" (*gser gyi skud pa nam mkha' la lding ba*) is the subtle self-radiance always present, not something to create; the "meeting face-to-face" (*zhal mjal*) is the collapse of recognizer-recognized separation, not an event of meeting two entities. The phrase "unconfused buddha" (*ma 'khrul pa'i sangs rgyas*) refers to awareness itself, which has never been confused—only apparently so through dualistic perception. The phrase "primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance" (*ka dag lhun grub kyi rang gdangs*) indicates the three aspects: (1) primordial purity (*ka dag*)—never corrupted by defilements; (2) spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)—not created by causes; (3) self-radiance (*rang gdangs*)—self-displaying without external agent. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "golden thread hovering in sky" as visualization to create rather than metaphorical description of awareness's subtle self-radiance. The Dzogchen view recognizes that this "introduction" (*ngo sprod*) is not information transfer but the pointing that reveals awareness has never been other than what is pointed to. The phrase "knowing the meaning" (*dgongs pa shes rab*) does not mean intellectual understanding but direct recognition (*ngo sprod*).>
