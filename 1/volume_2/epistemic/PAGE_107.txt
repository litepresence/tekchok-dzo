[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<The definitive teaching on awareness (*rig pa*) and emptiness (*stong pa*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening statement—nam mkha' stong pa la rig pa stong pa gtad pas ("having placed awareness-as-emptiness upon space-as-emptiness")—establishes the non-dual basis where space, emptiness, and awareness are not separate entities. The subsequent analysis of experience-emptiness equal to space (*nyams stong gsal 'phro 'du dang bral ba*) appearing as spontaneous-uncorrected display (*phyal yas pa cig 'char*) marks the definitive mode: awareness never departs from its own self-display. The statement of purpose—dngos po mtshan dang bral ba'i dgos pa yod de ("there exists a purpose of phenomena free from characteristics")—refers to recognition-function, not ontological status. The citation from sems sde (mind class) on yoga's abiding in space indicates that even provisional teachings point toward definitive ground. The *yul nam mkha' dang mthun pa'i nyams stong* ("experience-emptiness consistent with space") phrase establishes that valid experience is inseparable from the empty nature of appearance. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "emptiness" as mere absence rather than the self-luminous expanse of awareness.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISM]

<The threefold unity—appearance-emptiness non-dual view (*dbyings rig gnyis med kyi lta ba*), appearance-awareness undifferentiated view (*dbyings rig 'dres pa'i lta ba*), and appearance-awareness dissolved-into sameness taste view (*dbyings rig 'dres pas 'khor 'das ro mnyam kyi lta ba*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. These are not three stages or optional perspectives but a single recognition described from different angles: (1) the nature of awareness is the display (*dbyings*), not a separate object; (2) awareness never becomes separate from its own display; (3) in that non-separation, samsara and nirvana are already the same taste. The phrase *dbyings* (expanse) refers to awareness's own capacity to display; *rig pa* refers to the knowing quality; they are one nature (*ngo bo gcig*), two aspects (*rnam pa gnyis*). The citation from bstan bu continues this analysis. Risk of dualism: treating "expanse" as empty container and "awareness" as filler, rather than recognizing their inseparability as primordial state.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TECHNICISM]

<The wind-rig gnad (*rlung rig gi gnad*) presentation operates from *sems*-side pedagogy for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The instruction: relying on object (*yul*) and door (*sgo*) together, when wind is calmed (*rlung dal ba*) then hold awareness in concentration (*rig pa btson du gzung ba*)—this is *upāya* (skillful means), not definitive truth. The explanation that wind becomes calm causes expansion outward and holding inward is a provisional causal description for recognition preparation, not actual causation. The internal movement of concepts ceasing (*nang du rnam par rtog pa nub pa*) when wind is calmed creates conditions for recognition. The secret practice of awareness directly seeing (*gsang bar rig pa mngon sum du mthong ba*) and working in that manner accomplishes that even afflictions do not appear in that nature—all this describes the experiential process, not ontological transformation. The goal—sangs rgya bar byed pa ("to fully awaken")—refers to recognition of what was never obscured, not attainment of new state. Risk of technicism: treating "wind calming" and "holding awareness" as mechanical techniques rather than recognition-facilitating conditions.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The citation from *Thal 'Gyur* and subsequent analysis operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The repeated statement—rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub ("by wind-awareness calming, wisdom is accomplished")—appears three times with slight variations in the Tibetan (rab tu 'phang ba las byung bas / ces pa dang*). The crucial analysis: from fully releasing, body and mind connection dissolved, therefore even not reversed in three realms (*khams gsum du yang zlog pa min*). This establishes definitive recognition: when awareness recognizes itself, body-mind duality never existed, so "reversing" it is meaningless. The three realms do not dissolve because they never truly existed as separate from awareness. The final statement—rig pa'i gnad lu gu rgyud dbyings kyi ra bar bzhag nas mi 'gul bar byed pa ste ("having placed the awareness-gnad in the middle of the continuum between vessel-hook-continuum and expanse, make it not waver")—points to direct introduction. The "middle between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at form (*lu*—vessel) nor clinging to continuum (*nu*—thread) but resting as expanse (*dbyings*). Risk of reification: treating "wessel-hook-continuum" as entities rather than metaphoric descriptions of recognition's relationship to appearance.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE EYES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]

<The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) description operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structural recognition coordinates. The analysis continues from previous gnad: the wind-rig method enables recognition of three-eyed viewing. These are not literal eyes to visualize but recognition's three modes of seeing: (1) seeing through the dharmata-eye clearing latencies downward; (2) seeing through wisdom-eye looking evenly as same-taste of samsara-nirvana; (3) seeing through prajña-eye looking downward which settles wisdom-appearance. The "looking" directions (upward, even, downward) refer to recognition's orientation toward aspects of itself, not spatial directions. The instruction that "lazy ones need Sambhogakaya posture, diligent ones Nirmanakaya, equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture" (*g.yo ba ni longs sku, brtson 'byor ni sprul sku, btang snyoms ni chos sku'i bzhugs stangs la bzhag*) indicates that different practitioners require different entry-points based on their predominant capacity (*dbang po*). This is not hierarchical division but recognition-variety. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "three eyes" and "postures" as visual techniques rather than recognition-coordinate descriptions.>
