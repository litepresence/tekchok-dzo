[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

Extended body-cosmos correspondences operate as pedagogical mapping (upāya). The exhaustive taxonomic structure (earth = flesh, water = blood, sun-moon = eyes) provides conceptual scaffolding for recognition. Risk of literal reification if practitioner fixates on correspondences as ontological facts rather than recognition-pointers. View remains provisional until rigpa-identification is established.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Direct assertion: "All dharmas of samsara-nirvana, base-path, completely present in mind." This is definitive Dzogchen view without sequential qualification. The comprehensive enumeration of practices (mandala, deity, mantra, perfections) as "present in body and mind" negates need for external accomplishment. Functions as declarative finality within Longchenpa's hermeneutic.
