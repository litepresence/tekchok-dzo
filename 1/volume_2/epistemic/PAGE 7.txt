[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CORRESPONDENCE AS NONDUAL IDENTITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: CORRESPONDENCE MISREAD AS SYMBOLISM]

Musical instruments, victory banners, royal banners, canopies—all these appearing phenomena complete in yogi's body. Epistemic precision: "Correspondence" (*cha tshul*) here asserts nondual identity, not symbolic representation. Earth is not "like" flesh—they're identical in nature. The verb *tshang* (complete) indicates primordial saturation, not potential completeness. Risk: Symbolic reading—taking "sun-moon as eyes" as metaphor rather than recognition that solar/lunar light and visual perception are the same wisdom-display.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTAL CORRESPONDENCE EXHAUSTIVE TAXONOMY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALIZATION]

Expanding these aspects: earth aspect flesh, water aspect blood, fire aspect heat, wind aspect breath, space aspect mind, sun-moon aspect two eyes, male aspect birth, female aspect death, planet aspect desire's door and two nostrils, constellation aspect teeth, cloud aspect hair, tree aspect channels, mountain aspect whole body, cliff aspect bones, great tree root aspect heart, branches aspect limbs, flower aspect five senses, fruit aspect body's pleasure-pain, sound aspect voice, form aspect body, smell aspect body hair, taste aspect skin, touch aspect disease, musical instrument aspect intestines and internal organs.

Epistemic precision: This exhaustive taxonomy serves to prevent partial recognition. If only some correspondences are recognized, substantialization persists. The completeness of mapping—every external element has internal counterpart—establishes nonduality of outer-inner as total, not selective. Risk: Substantialization—treating "constellations as teeth" as literal anatomy rather than recognition that stellar patterns and dental structure are equally wisdom-display.
