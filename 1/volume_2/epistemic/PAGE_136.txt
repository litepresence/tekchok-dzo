[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND REVERSAL THROUGH POSTURE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TECHNOLOGICAL REDUCTIONISM]

<That returning outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body-mind warmth arises. Two palms pressed earth, moving action wind returns. That returning outward thigle and particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping wind returns. That returning outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts! The postures reverse the winds, but this is recognition not technique. Risk of technological reductionism: treating this as mechanical wind-control rather than wisdom-display.>
