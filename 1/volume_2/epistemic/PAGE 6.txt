[265-283]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Continuation of completeness teaching with explicit rigpa-view identifications: "moving projecting wind is self-aware awakening, great bliss." The verse structure equates physiological processes with wisdom-display without hierarchical transformation. Final line—"all appearing sentient beings primordially liberated without effort"—is definitive assertion from rigpa-side.

[284-297]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

Reversing delusion (ldog tshul) presentation operates pedagogically. The correspondences (birth = awareness moving, death = final arrival) provide conceptual framework for recognition. This is sems-side entry—using conceptual mapping to point toward non-conceptual realization. The text explicitly marks this as requiring instruction, empowerment, and meditation.

[298-313]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE → RIGPA SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

Gradual view-shift: starting with body-completeness (conventional correlation of body parts with cosmic elements) moving toward rigpa-identification. The "Pearl Garland" citation operates as scriptural authority for view-ascension. The exhaustive list (mountains, stars, clouds) serves negational function—exhausting conceptual grasp to point beyond.
