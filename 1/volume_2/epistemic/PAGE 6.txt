[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LIFE-STAGES AS WISDOM-DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

Longchenpa presents the complete arc of embodiment—from conception to death—as nondual wisdom display. The throwing wind's movement is bodhi self-awareness great bliss; five elements' cause seed arises as appearance from emptiness sphere; nondual bliss samadhi is method-born prajna; entering the womb is self-awareness appearing from the base. Seven sets of seven measure realization; ten months traverse the grounds; birth is body-arising; body-producing is base-appearance sphere; dwelling in body is the base; aging liberates true-grasping confusion; sickness is realization's confidence; death liberates into dharmatā emptiness. Thus all appearing sentient beings are primordially liberated without effort.

Epistemic precision: The poem maps biological events onto wisdom-terms not sequentially but simultaneously. "Birth is body-arising" doesn't mean birth causes body-arising; they're identical. The ten months "traversing grounds" isn't developmental psychology—it's atemporal recognition that embryogenesis IS ground-traversal. Risk: Temporal reading—seeing this as progressive stages of spiritual development rather than always-already wisdom-display.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CONFUSION REVERSAL AS RECOGNITION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Birth is awareness moving from expanse; body is base; outer appearance aspect is base-appearance spontaneous presence; sickness is recognition breakthrough; aging liberates true-grasping confusion; death is self-recognition reaching primordial purity's ground. These being primordially arisen, instruction introduction, empowerment, and meditation liberate. If primordially complete in similar aspect, instruction cannot liberate.

Epistemic layering: The text shifts from declarative (death IS self-recognition) to instructional provisionality (therefore instruction liberates) to conditional (if already complete, instruction fails). This prevents both nihilism (nothing to do) and reification (practice as causal mechanism). Risk: Practice misreading—taking "meditation liberates" as causal claim rather than pedagogical pointer for those needing framework.
