[NYINGMA TRADITION & LINEAGE HISTORY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: LINEAGE-REIFICATION]

<The Nyingma tradition (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*) represent the two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and the treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). Longchenpa received both streams, integrating them in his *mdzod* corpus. The gnad that reliance on such masters (*de ltar pa'i thogs kyis zhag gsum*) guarantees liberation without doubt (*'di'am bar do*)—this is *upāya*: when one relies on masters without doubt, the result is certain liberation (*'di'am bar do*). Risk of lineage-reification: treating "reliance" as faith-based dependency rather than transmission facilitation through recognition.>

[ORDINARY COGNITION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: DEVOTIONALISM]

<The teaching on reliance (*de ltar pa'i*) operates from *ordinary cognition* (*sems*), not definitive Dzogchen view. The gnad that dependence is (*de ltar*)—this indicates that the teaching provides a provisional framework for those who cannot yet rest in direct recognition. The instruction that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—on supreme ones (*rin po che*)—indicates the path of faith-based devotion, not wisdom-based recognition. The gnad that no doubt (*'di'am bar do*) arises (*'byung*) from this proper reliance—this indicates that when reliance is correct, liberation (*'di'am bar do*) arises spontaneously without doubt (*'byung*). This is *sems-side* pedagogy for gradual path; risk of devotion-based liberation is that it can create dependency rather than recognition of primordial state.>

[NYINGMA LINEAGE TRANSMISSION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The two lineages of transmission (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* and *gter brgyud*) are contrasted with their different approaches. The teaching that Nyingma tradition (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*)—those relying on (*de ltar*)—the treasure (*gter*)—this establishes Nyingma as text-based, treasure as mind-based. The citation from Longchenpa's *mdzod*: "Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava" (*bi ma la 'dzin pa* and *pad+ma 'byung gnas*)—these represent the two lineages, not mere historical figures. The gnad that "this or that" (*'di'am bar do*)—this is *upāya*: reliance can be on either without affecting one's own primordial state, suggesting *text-based* versus *mind-based* transmission are equally valid. Risk of substantialism: treating transmission lineages as ontologically distinct rather than pedagogical modalities for different capacities.>

[SUPREME GURUS & LINEAGE HISTORY]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: DEVOTIONALISM]

<The supreme gurus (*rnal 'byor ma bstan pa*)—these are the ultimate authorities. The gnad that such ones have (*rin po che*)—establishes their supreme status (*grub mchog*) and authority (*gnas yod*). The gnad that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—indicates singular focus. The statement that "those who properly practice" (*dam pa'i slar bzhin pa yin*)—this sets up *upāya* for proper transmission without deviation. The gnad that liberation (*'bras pa*)—this indicates the goal is actual liberation (*'bras pa*), not just correct understanding. The statement that liberation "from such supreme ones" (*de yang rnal 'byor ma bstan pa las 'bras pa*)—this establishes that liberation comes from the lineage, not independently achieved. Risk of devotion-based attainment: treating "liberation from gurus" as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The recognition-view teaching (*snang ba gzugs su rdzogs pa'i tshad*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The gnad that recognition sees (*mthong ba*)—this establishes direct recognition without intervening conceptualization. The statement that recognition's appearance (*snang ba*) becomes exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes, delusion (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*) is exhausted (*zad*). The gnad that recognition rests (*drangs pa las*)—this establishes the non-dual state after recognition. The gnad that "not two but one" (*gnyis pa ma yin gcig*)—this indicates the ultimate non-duality (*gnyis pa*) of recognition and display. Risk of view collapse: mixing *rigpa-side* non-dual recognition with *sems-side* dualistic teachings about practice states.>

[5588-5610]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The recognition-resting teaching (*drangs pa las*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition rests in nature (*rang bzhin*)—this indicates recognition's ground state. The gnad that "without fabrication" (*bcos pa med*)—this establishes that recognition's rest is uncontrived, not a cultivated state. The gnad that "without moving" (*g.yo ba*)—this indicates that recognition is not agitated, stable. The gnad that "without effort" (*'tshul ba*)—this indicates that recognition's rest is effortless, natural. Risk of reification: treating "without fabrication/effort" as states to achieve rather than recognition of primordial quality.>

[5611-5615]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE-REIFICATION]

<The recognition-arising teaching (*rang 'byung ba'o*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition arises (*'byung ba'o*)—this indicates that recognition's experience (*nyams*) emerges spontaneously from its nature. The statement that "arising as experience" (*'byung ba nyams*)—this suggests that recognition's experience (*nyams*) manifests without cause (*rkyen*). The gnad that "from that" (*de nas*)—this establishes causal relationship between recognition's experience and its nature. Risk of practice-reification: treating "arising as experience" as some technique to practice rather than natural manifestation of recognition.>

[5616-5619]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE-REIFICATION]

<The recognition-gathering teaching (*rang 'byung ba nyams*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition's experience (*nyams*) is gathered (*'byung ba nyams*)—this indicates that recognition's experience accumulates, not through effort. The statement that "without exertion" (*'brtul kyang brtags tu*)—this indicates effortless accumulation. The gnad that "into self" (*rang ngo ba*)—this indicates that experience returns to recognition's essence (*ngo ba*). Risk of reification: treating "self-return" as some practice technique rather than natural return to primordial state.>
