[RISK: LIBERATION AS EVENT]

The presentation of completion (rdzogs pa) establishes simultaneous fullness across all dimensions—not accumulation of qualities but recognition of primordial completeness. The eight liberations function as declarative statements of what is already the case: obscurations are not removed but recognized as never-established (ma rig pa sangs). Risk of reading these as stages of purification to achieve rather than statements of fact regarding the nature of mind. The presentation emphasizes that "without effort" (mi rtsol) liberation is already complete.

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

The three kayas presentation continues with detailed analysis of dharmakaya characteristics: empty clarity (stong gsal), unceasing self-arisen luminosity (gag med rang 'dzag), and pervasive three aspects (khyab pa gsum). The six aspects of dharmakaya (nature, definition, display, sign, appearance, place) function as phenomenological description of recognition, not ontological categories. The text maintains declarative finality regarding primordial purity (ka dag) as unchanging reality (mi 'gyur ba).
