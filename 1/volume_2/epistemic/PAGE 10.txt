[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Assertion of nonduality between winds and wisdom: "life and nondual, awareness and nondual." This marks view-shift from tantric classification (previous lines) to Dzogchen recognition. The fivefold nonduality structure operates from rigpa-side—winds are not transformed into wisdom but recognized as never separate from it.

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW → DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY → DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Gradual view-ascension within passage: continued enumeration of wind-subdivisions (color-producing, all-pervading, karma winds) maintains tantric framework while increasingly emphasizing wisdom-connection. The functional descriptions ("producing awareness potential," "pervading wisdom") bridge tantric practice and Dzogchen recognition. Final lines on "wisdom dimension gathering" mark transition to definitive view.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Conclusive assertion: 25 winds "gather into five roots" and ultimately rely on "awareness wisdom" in the heart. The "essential point" (gnad) formulation is characteristic of Dzogchen definitive teaching. Final line—"when awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathers"—is direct pointing to completion stage realization where wind-mind dissolves into wisdom-display.
