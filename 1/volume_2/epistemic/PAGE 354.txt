[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WISDOM BODY MANIFESTATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Self-above wisdom's body variously spreading seen, certainty obtained, that also like star-arrow. Emanation twenty-seven days benefit can do. Medium's supreme: nine days take, also cluster five days, wisdom four days. Then certainty obtained, whatever-appearance all mirror-like realized, seen, stability obtained. Emanation also thirty days benefit can do. Medium best: ten days take, also cluster five, wisdom's appearance four days. The various days indicate capacity for recognition, not fixed temporal realities. Risk: reifying the wisdom body as an entity that appears rather than recognizing it as one's own nature.>
