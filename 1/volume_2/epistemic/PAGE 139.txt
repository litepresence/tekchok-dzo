<The passage begins with the "four great confidences" (gdeng chen bzhi) that arise in the practitioner—confidence in the spontaneously completed three kāyas, in cause and effect as delusory display, in primordial completion without hope for liberation, and in the certainty of ka-dag. The epistemic stance initially appears to be sems-side (confidence as a quality of the practitioner) but shifts to rigpa-side as Longchenpa cites Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud to establish these as recognition itself. The transition to the sixteen visions (snang ba bcu drug) operates within a pedagogical framework that maps Dzogchen experiences onto the bodhisattva stages (sa bcu drug), but explicitly negates this mapping as definitive ontology: "not the actual bodhisattva stages" (byang chub sems dpa'i sa bcu dngos ni ma yin). This is a deliberate view-layering: using conventional frameworks to point to what transcends them.>
