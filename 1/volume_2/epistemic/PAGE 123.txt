[RISK: THAL 'GYUR-REIFICATION]

<The Thal 'Gyur purification teaching (*tshad phebs lus kyang di ltar 'gyur*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The gnad that purification is purification (*de ltar phebs nas rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this establishes that recognition is purified through elimination of afflictions (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*), not through accumulation of virtues. The gnad that therefore afflictions (*dngos pa'i*) exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this is definitive: delusion has never truly existed to eliminate. Risk of Thal 'Gyur reification: treating "Thal 'Gyur purification" as ritual practice rather than natural recognition of primordial purity.>

[RISK: FIVE FAMILIES-REIFICATION]

<The five-families teaching (*thad ka'i dngos snang 'gags pa dang*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for structured path. The teaching that also (*yang*) five precious ones (*rin po che*)—this indicates that Buddha-families manifest as five qualities. The gnad that wisdom's wind (*ye shes kyi rlung*) completely pure (*rnam par dag*) seeing recognition's appearance (*snang ba*)—this establishes that wisdom's wind is recognition's own luminosity appearing as five families (*ye shes lnga*). The gnad that recognition appears (*snang ba'i*), exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i*), wisdom recognizes (*mthong bas*)—this indicates that when wisdom's purity manifests, recognition recognizes its appearance and delusion is exhausted. Risk of five-families reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

The gnad that wisdom's self-resonance completely shines (*ye shes kyi rang gdangs so sor gsal ba las byung ba'o*)—this establishes that wisdom (*ye shes*) is awareness's (*rig pa*) own self-resonance (*rang gdangs*) that shines (*gsal ba*) spontaneously (*las byung ba*). The statement that therefore dharmata's wisdom from space displays (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes mkhar thab tu 'char ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings ye shes*) appears as space's (*mkhar thab*) display (*'char ba*).
