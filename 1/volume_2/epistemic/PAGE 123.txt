[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

Measure-reached body (tshad phebs lus) description from tantra: light body (od kyi lus), copper-shining (zang thal), three kayas coiled (sku gsum gcig 'dril). The epistemic stance describes natural signs of stabilized recognition, not constructed achievement. Finality indicated by self-liberated awareness (rang grol). Risk of reification if physical transformation descriptions are taken literally as ontological changes rather than recognition-symbols.
