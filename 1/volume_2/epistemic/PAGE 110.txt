[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The four similes (*lu gu nu thag*) establish definitive Dzogchen view through analogical reasoning: vessel (*lu*) like a good water vessel—water increases and decreases without arising, spontaneous presence without effort; hook (*gu*)—within that very one, dharmata's non-mistaken view and meditation drawn; continuum (*nu*)—pervading saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, from those gathered appearances clarifying bodies, thigle dispersion, increase, gathering, etc. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom; from that appearance becomes four: dharmata-actual-appearance destroys intellectual grasping-view; experience-appearance increase upward dissolves delusion-appearance; rigpa-measure-reached-appearance transcends three-kaya realization-path-appearance; dharmata-exhaustion-appearance cuts three-realm saṃsāra continuum." These four appearances are not sequential stages but simultaneous modalities of recognition-deepening: direct appearance (*mngon sum*), experiential increase (*nyams 'phel*), measure-completion (*tshad phebs*), exhaustion (*zad pa*). The Dzogchen view recognizes these as awareness's own display, never departing from primordial purity, spontaneously self-liberating without effort.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: STAGE-FETISHISM]

<Masterful analysis:
The detailed enumeration of four appearances—external sun-moon four-times increase-decrease; internal body-speech-mind-consciousness four bindings liberation; secret four-empowerments definitive showing; suchness four-lamp appearances definitive—operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structural mapping. Risk of stage-fetishism: taking these "four" as mandatory sequential progression rather than recognition-descriptions. The definite sequence explanation: without seeing first ground dharmata-directly, the remaining three have no arising-basis, therefore first dharmata-direct-appearance arises as support-base. This is not temporal causation but logical grounding: recognition (*rig pa*) must first recognize its own nature before "deepening" can occur. The Dzogchen integration: the sequence is pedagogical scaffolding; definitive view recognizes all four as simultaneous aspects of single awareness-display. The emphasis on stabilizing experience (*nyams brtan pa*)—without stability, no confidence in dharma, no warmth (*sangs*)—marks practical recognition work within definitive view: recognition is immediate but stabilizing recognition requires familiarity (*goms pa*).>
