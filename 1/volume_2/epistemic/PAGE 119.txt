[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILIES RESTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: FAMILIES-REIFICATION]

<The five-families teaching (*rigs dang rigs kyi khyad par las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured understanding. Therefore wisdom's wind (*rlung*) completely (*rnam par dag pa*) sees recognition's appearance (*snang ba*) as looking at it (*me long lta bu'i*)—this indicates that recognition's resting causes wisdom to see its own display directly. The instruction that depending on (*brten nas*), recognition's experience (*nyams*) spontaneously arises (*'phel 'byung ba'o*)—this establishes that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. The gnad that ordinary mind's arm extends (*mnyam pa nyid kyi rtsibs shar du snang ba ni*) recognition—this indicates that when recognition rests, ordinary mind's grasping (*rtsibs*) naturally extends toward it. Risk of five-families reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5185-5195]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DELUSION EXHAUSTION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: EXHAUSTION-REIFICATION]

<The delusion-exhaustion teaching (*'khrul pa'i snang ba zad du*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. The statement that all (*nye ba*) wisdom's (*nyid do*)—this is *upāya* for practitioners: delusion and wisdom are not separate entities; delusion is exhausted (*zad*). The gnad that therefore cognition gathers (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that when recognition arises, cognition (*sor rtog pa*) gathers (*gru*) completely (*chad du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba*). The teaching that arising's precious qualities time (*byung ba'i phra ba 'gag pa'i dus so*)—this is provisional describing how precious qualities (*'gag pa*) manifest over time (*dus so*). Risk of exhaustion-reification: treating "delusion-exhaustion" as gradual achievement rather than recognition of what was never established.>

[5195-5204]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION WISDOM]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: WISDOM-REIFICATION]

<The recognition-wisdom teaching (*bya ba grub pa'i re lde'i rnam pa tsam du snang ba ni*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side*. Arising (*bya ba*) established (*grub pa*) emptiness (*stong ldan gyi*) recognition's appearance (*rnam pa*)—this is provisional teaching that recognition appears as wisdom (*re lde*). The gnad that wisdom's self-resonance completely shines (*ye shes kyi rang gdangs so sor gsal ba las byung ba'o*)—this establishes that wisdom (*ye shes*) is awareness's (*rig pa*) own self-resonance (*rang gdangs*) that shines (*gsal ba*) spontaneously (*las byung ba*). The statement that therefore dharmata's wisdom from space displays (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes mkhar thab tu 'char ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings ye shes*) appears as space's (*mkhar thab*) display (*'char ba*). Risk of wisdom-reification: treating "wisdom" as separate quality rather than awareness's self-knowing.>

[5204-5193]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX ACCUMULATIONS]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: ACCUMULATION-REIFICATION]

<The six-accumulations teaching (*de las 'khor lo la sogs pa'i rnam pa sna tshogs su*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. Therefore action (*de las*) of going around (*'khor lo*) the six accumulations (*rnam pa sna tshogs su*) appear (*snang ba ni*) and go (*sngon 'gro*) through awareness's meditative observation (*mthar phyin pa*) and arise (*las byung ba*)—this describes how recognition perceives the six accumulations as they appear and dissolve. The gnad that therefore action of appearance recognition going liberates (*de las dra bar snang ba ni sngon du 'gro ba tshad du phyin pa las byung ba'o*)—this is the key: when action (*las*) is applied to appearance (*dra bar*), recognition (*snang ba ni*) going into (*sngon 'gro*) recognition (*tshad du phyin pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of accumulation-reification: treating "six accumulations" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-descriptions of experience modes.>

[5193-5200]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – COGNITION CUTTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: COGNITION-OBJECTIFICATION]

<The cognition-cutting teaching (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i me tog gi tshom bur 'char ba ni*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. Therefore cognition (*sor rtog pa*) cutting (*me tog gi*) off (*bur*) appearance (*'char ba ni*)—this is provisional teaching for detaching from conceptual cognition. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's precise analysis (*rab tu spel legs pa*) causes liberation (*las byung ba*). Risk of cognition-objectification: treating "cognition" as some separate entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its self-nature.>

[5200-5208]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – GNAD LOOKING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: GNAD-OBJECTIFICATION]

<The gnad-looking teaching (*gzigs stangs las 'grus pa las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. The gnad: (*gzigs*) looking (*stangs las*) establishes (*grus pa*) and (*byung ba*)—this indicates that recognition's "looking" (*gzigs*) is the key: seeing recognition's own appearance. The gnad that therefore dharmata's wisdom object gathering recognition (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes yul gru tsam du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings*) object (*yul*) gathering (*gru tsam du*) recognition (*snang ba ni*)—this is provisional describing recognition's relationship to dharmata. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's clarity (*rab tu*) through precision (*spel*) skill (*legs pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of gnad-objectification: treating "gnad" as technique rather than recognition-key.>

[5208-5215]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – CLEARING ACTION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: ACTION-REIFICATION]

<The clearing-action teaching (*de las sbyangs pa las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. Therefore action (*de las*) of clearing (*sbyangs pa*) arises (*las byung ba*)—this is provisional teaching that recognition's clearing arises spontaneously. The gnad that established six accumulations all exhausted (*brtson 'grus rab rnams la bar du zhag lnga'o*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes accumulation's exhaustion (*zhag lnga*), this is not a gradual process but definitive recognition. The gnad that established action seeing going completely liberates (*brtson 'grus pa las pad+ma stong ldan du 'char ba ni sngon 'gro 'byongs pa las byung ba'o*)—this is comprehensive: established (*brtson 'grus*) action (*pa las*), Padma (*pad+ma*) emptiness (*stong ldan*), seeing (*du 'char ba ni*), going (*sngon 'gro*), completely (*'byongs pa*), liberating (*las byung ba*). Risk of action-reification: treating "clearing" and "liberation" as separate practices rather than recognition-description.>

[5215-5225]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-NATURE ARISING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SELF-NATURE REIFICATION]

<The self-nature teaching (*rang bzhin ma bcos pa las byung ba'o*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Self-nature (*rang bzhin*) unmodified (*ma bcos pa*) arises (*las byung ba*)—this definitively establishes that recognition's self-nature is uncaused and arises spontaneously. This is not gradual cultivation (*ma bcos pa*) but natural unfolding (*las byung ba*). Risk of self-nature reification: treating "self-nature" as something to cultivate rather than recognition's uncaused quality.>

[5225-5235]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION INTEGRATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: RECOGNITION-SEPARATION]

<The cognition-integration teaching (*de las 'khor lo la sogs pa'i rnam pa sna tshogs su snang ba ni sngon 'gro mthar phyin pa las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured recognition. The statement that action of going around (*de las 'khor lo*) the six accumulations (*rnam pa sna tshogs su*) appear (*snang ba ni*) and go (*sngon 'gro*) through awareness's meditative observation (*mthar phyin pa*) and arise (*las byung ba*)—this describes recognition's integration (*las byung ba*) of perception, appearance, and action. The gnad that therefore action of appearance recognition going liberates (*de las dra bar snang ba ni sngon du 'gro ba tshad du phyin pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that when recognition goes (*sngon 'gro*) into appearance (*dra bar*), recognition (*tshad du phyin pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of recognition-separation: treating "recognition" as something separate from appearance rather than recognition's capacity to see its own display.>
