[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

<Masterful analysis:
From family and family's distinction arising—the natural differentiation within singular nature. Then wisdom's wind purified, mirror-like's condition upright-standing appearance—depending on that, experience's increase arises. Equality's spokes arising appearance—delusion-appearance near exhaustion. Discriminating's boat-cut appearance—elements' subtle ceasing time. Action-accomplished's mere banner form appearance—wisdom's self-radiance individually clear arising. Then dharmadhātu wisdom field-boat form appearance—conception coarse ceasing arising. Risk of temporalization: interpreting these sequences as mandatory temporal progression (first this, then that) rather than simultaneous dimensions of recognition. The Dzogchen view: the "path-arising sequence" (*lam skye ba'i rim pa*) indicates pedagogical unfolding, not metaphysical stages—excellent diligence five-five days, medium seven-seven days, lower twenty-one twenty-one days, higher appearance ceasing, again lower those appearances clearly appearing—these timeframes are *upāya* meeting practitioners' capacities, not iron laws.

Color and shape's between here momentarily abiding appear. Then those dissolving, five wisdoms' shape form dawning—mirror-like's shape eye-patterned form becomes. That from color excellently increased good arising. From familiarizing that, eye variegated clearly appearing—this from preliminaries measure-reached arising. Then equality half-net clearly appearing—from wind's purification pure arising. From that net appearance—from preliminaries distinct complete arising. Then discriminating flower-cluster clearly appearing—from seeing-mode diligence arising. From that thousand-possessing lotus clearly appearing—from preliminaries mastery arising. Then action-accomplished weapon-like clearly appearing—from nature uncontrived arising. From that wheel etc. various form appearances—from preliminaries completion arising. Then dharmadhātu wisdom palace dawning... [continues]. The Dzogchen integration: all these "shapes" (*dbyibs*) are awareness's self-display; the "preliminaries" (*sngon 'gro*) are recognition preparation, not separate practices; the definitive view recognizes that palace has never been other than awareness's own nature.>
