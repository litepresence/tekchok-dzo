[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The passage presents the great transfer ('pho ba chen mo) and the control over birth and entry as the fruition of Dzogchen practice. The epistemic stance is definitive—Longchenpa describes the vajra body and the ability to enter awareness into three thousand beings simultaneously, emanate whatever is desired, and manifest benefit spontaneously. The risk lies in reifying these descriptions as literal supernatural powers or as attainments that establish the practitioner as superior to others. The passage operates from the rigpa-side where the distinction between self and other, between benefit and benefactor, has dissolved. The reference to Vimala and Padma serves as scriptural validation within the Dzogchen tradition, not as proof of ontological claims. The "copper-shining" (zang thal) body is presented as wisdom's illusory display, not a physical transformation.>
