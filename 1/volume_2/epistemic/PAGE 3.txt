[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

This passage operates from a provisional Dzogchen view that employs embryological schema as pedagogical entry. The description of elemental development in the womb (earth-flesh, water-blood, fire-warmth, wind-breath) uses conventional causation language to guide practitioners toward recognizing body formation patterns. The presentation relies on Sutra-style sequence (karma wind → development) as an upāya rather than asserting ontological process.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[POLEMICAL DISTINCTION]

Shifts to a view that reinterprets elemental causation through wisdom categories. The assignment of "wisdom of arising" to fire and "master of arising" to water constitutes a Dzogchen reframe of Abhidharma causal schemas. This operates polemically to distinguish Dzogchen's view of elements as wisdom-display from conventional elemental theory.

[156-166]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Direct view of primordial awareness. The passage asserts nondual identity between dharmakāya and elements without causal mediation: earth IS unchanging essence, fire IS awareness-wisdom engagement. No sequential transformation is posited. This is definitive Dzogchen view within the text's hermeneutic framework.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

Continues direct rigpa-view with explicit identification of outer elements as self-awareness. The phrase "outer-appearing elements, by connecting with self-awareness itself" risks reification if read as asserting elements literally "are" awareness rather than being pedagogical pointers. The view here presupposes completion stage realization.
