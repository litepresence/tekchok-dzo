[ORDINARY COGNITION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The systematic enumeration of elemental characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) proceeds through conventional Abhidharmic taxonomy: earth-solidity (*sa'i mtshan nyid sra ba*), water-moisture (*chu'i mtshan nyid gshir ba*), fire-heat (*me'i mtshan nyid dro ba*), wind-movement (*rlung gi mtshan nyid g.yo ba*), space-opening/vastness (*nam mkha'i mtshan nyid go 'byed la yangs pa*). These definitions derive from classical Indian Buddhist cosmology preserved in Tibetan *mdzod* literature. Pedagogically, establishing these conventional characteristics creates the necessary contrast for Dzogchen's radical redefinition: what appear as inherent material properties will be revealed as wisdom-qualities of awareness's self-display. The Wylie terms function as placeholders for concepts that will undergo tantric and Dzogchen transformation in subsequent analysis.>

[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Masterful analysis:
The *Thal 'Gyur* citation presents the sequence of embryonic development (*las kyi rim pa*) through elemental functions: earth establishing the body's foundation (*lus kyi gzhi*), water gathering and producing blood, fire ripening into warmth, wind lifting and becoming breath. This operates within *tantric transformative view* where physiological processes are correlated with subtle body mechanics (*rtsa rlung thig le*). The language of ripening (*smin pa*) and producing (*bskyed pa*) must not be reified as material causation but understood as the spontaneous display (*lhun grub*) of wisdom-energies. Risk: readers may interpret this as literal embryology rather than symbolic mapping of awareness's manifestation through apparent physical processes. The Dzogchen integration recognizes these "functions" as recognition-marks of single awareness-display.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The dharma-nature (*chos nyid*) section marks definitive Dzogchen exposition. While "generally empty" (*spyi r stong pa*) refers to Madhyamaka analysis, here the focus is on *rang gi mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i chos nyid*—dharma-nature holding its own characteristic, indicating self-recognizing awareness. The *Rang Shar* citation identifies each element with wisdom-qualities: earth as cause (*rgyu*), fire as discriminating awareness (*shes rab*), wind as emanation (*sprul pa*), water as sovereign (*bdag po*), space as dharma-nature itself. This is not metaphorical correlation but definitive identification: the elements ARE wisdom-display. The Wylie terms *chos nyid* (dharmatā) and *shes rab* (prajñā) indicate atemporal recognition rather than sequential development.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DUALISM]

<Masterful analysis:
The application of meaning (*don sbyar*) section presents definitive Dzogchen non-duality. Dharmakāya's primordial purity (*chos sku gdod nas dag pa'i rang bzhin*) is identified as earth through unchanging nature; awareness-wisdom (*rig pa'i ye shes*) operating in meaning is fire; unmoved wisdom departing to expanse is wind; wisdom gathering three cavities into one is water; wisdom's empty-luminosity non-dual absorption is space. These correlations are not symbolic mappings but direct identifications: *'byung ba* = *ye shes*. Risk of dualism: maintaining distinction between "element" and "wisdom" misses that they are identical—*'byung ba* does not "represent" wisdom but IS wisdom's display. The Wylie phrase *ngang du thim pa* (absorbing into state) indicates non-dual immersion, not sequential process.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The individual application (*so so'i don sbyar*) from *Nor bu 'phrul bkod* (Jeweled Array tantra) establishes that outer five elements (*phyi 'byung ba lnga*) are common (*thun mong*) self-nature dharmas (*rang rgyud kyi chos*). The crucial identification: all externally appearing elements are one's own awareness (*rang gi rig pa nyid*). This is not philosophical idealism asserting mind-dependent reality, but Dzogchen's radical non-duality: there is no "external" apart from awareness's self-display. The term *thun mong* (common) indicates these are the shared basis for both confused (*'khrul*) and liberated (*grol*) recognition—not that they belong to "everyone" as reified subjects, but that they are the common ground (*gzhi*) from which all apparent difference displays.>
