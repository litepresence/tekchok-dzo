[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SYMBOLIC LITERALISM]

Longchenpa establishes the completeness (*rdzogs pa*) of dharmas in body and mind through cosmological correspondences drawn from the Self-Arisen (*rang shar*) tantra. The epistemic move is analogical—demonstrating that all phenomena are already complete within the microcosm of the practitioner.

**Cosmological Correspondences:**
- Sun and moon = prajna and upaya (*shes rab thabs*)
- Male = base, female = path (*gzhis la bud med lam*)
- Planets = realization measure (*rtogs tshad*), stars = dharmas
- Clouds = compassion all-pervading (*thugs rje kun la khyab*)
- Trees = dharmata expansive path
- Mountains = view unchanging (*lta ba 'gyur ba med*)
- Rocks = dharmakaya birth-death free
- Root = all dharmas single cause
- Branches = bodhi branches (*byang chub yan lag*)
- Hollow trunk = emptiness single taste
- Leaves = pervading dharmadhatu

[RISK: SYMBOLIC LITERALISM] These correspondences must not be read as metaphysical identities. The Wylie *ni* (is) functions as hermeneutical connector, not ontological equation. Clouds are not compassion; they analogically reveal the pervading nature of compassion.

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY] "In body and mind completely abide" (*lus dang sems la rdzogs par gnas*)—the epistemic stance is that enlightenment is not sought externally but recognized as already complete in one's own embodiment.
