[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

Highest-level completeness teaching: all dharmas "complete in whatever face of self-appearing awareness." The verse structure shifts from body/mind (previous sections) to awareness itself (rigpa) as locus of completion. Key line: "dharmas of mind and entity are all merely imputed"—this is direct assertion of primordial purity (kadag) view where awareness alone is fundamental.

[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Transition to inner arising (nang 'byung) presentation marks shift to tantric subtle body schema. The 25-fold division (five elements each containing five) belongs to completion stage practice framework, not definitive view. The description of winds, channels, and essences as "supporting wisdom" is provisional methodology for transformation practice.
