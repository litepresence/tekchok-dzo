[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

Extensive negation chains ('med series) dismantling meditation (sgom), analysis (dpyad), accomplishment (sgrub), action (byed). Paired with citation from Rinpoche Spungs pa tantra establishing primordially pure nature (ye nas chod). Epistemic stance beyond meditation/non-meditation (sgom phyal). Risk of nihilism if negations are interpreted as denial of all activity rather than release from conceptual fixation. Finality indicated by "grub zin" (already accomplished).
