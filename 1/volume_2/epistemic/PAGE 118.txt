[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VISIONARY-OBJECTION]

<Masterful analysis:
The wisdom-palace (*ye shes mkhar thab*) visions—similar to sun-moon pair-connect form, lotus-stack form, stupa-stack form, thousand-possessing lotus form—seeing transcends five elements' binding. These also: called experience through one-arising one-ceasing; that also: called increase-above because different from before. Thus rigpa's arising is from previously relying on empowerment sequence. This operates within *tantric transformative view* where visionary experiences (*snang ba*) serve as purification-markers (*rnam dag*) on the path. Risk of visionary-objection: reifying these appearances as external entities to be attained rather than recognition of awareness's self-display. The Dzogchen integration: the "similar" (*'dra ba*) terminology indicates analogical pointing, not literal description—wisdom-palace is not a building but awareness's own structure; sun-moon pair is not astronomical bodies but method-wisdom non-duality.

The five wisdoms' color appearance detailed: Vajra family purified—mirror-like wisdom self-light white color form dawning, that same Vajra Akṣobhya resonance white piercing dawning. Below that Tathāgata family purified—dharmadhātu wisdom blue color form dawning, Vairocana resonance blue-black dawning. Jewel family purified—equality wisdom yellow cloth, Jewel Source resonance excellently piercing like refined gold dawning. Lotus family purified—discriminating wisdom red cloth, Amitābha resonance red excellently red like coral color dawning. Karma family purified—action-accomplishing wisdom green cloth, Amoghasiddhi resonance excellently green like indranīla form dawning. These outer sequence blue vajra fence surrounding: showing those wisdoms non-different. From that vision increase: five lights individually chief five colors five clear. The Dzogchen view: these colors are not external phenomena but awareness's self-radiance (*rang 'od*)—the "families" (*rigs*) are modalities of single awareness, not separate Buddha-fields to visit.>
