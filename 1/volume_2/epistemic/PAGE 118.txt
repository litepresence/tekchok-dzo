[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILIES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DEITY-REIFICATION]

<The five-families (*rigs rnam pa*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The description: Ye She's (*ye shes mkhar thab kyi rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Nyi Dzong's (*nyi zla zung sbrel gyi rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Padma's precious (*pad+ma brtsegs pa'i rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Offering-precious (*mchod rten brtsegs pa'i rnam pa 'dra ba dang*)—these are not literal deities but recognition-display modes (*rnam pa*) describing awareness's capacity to manifest as five wisdom-families (*ye shes lnga*). The gnad: Padma, emptiness-possessing (*pad+ma stong ldan gyi rnam pa*) seeing (*mthong bas*), arising's, bonds, liberated (*'byung ba lnga'i 'ching byed las 'das pa'o*)—this establishes that when recognition (*mthong ba*) sees emptiness (*stong ldan*), the five arisings naturally liberate without needing to cut bonds (*'ching*). These (*de dag kyang gcig skyes gcig 'gags pas nyams zhes bya'o*)—recognition sees the five families as one arsing (*gcig skyes*), not separate entities (*'gags*). Risk of deity-reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5160-5170]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SNGAR DBANG]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: TECHNICISM]

<The sngar dbang (*sngar dbang*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. Also (*de yang snga ma bas khyad par du 'gyur bas gong 'phel zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that distinguishing (*khyad par 'gyur*) from previous (*snga ma*) causes separation (*gong 'phel*). The statement that therefore, recognition, arising (*de ltar rig pas byung ba ni*)—establishes that recognition (*rig pa*) is the cause (*las*) of arising (*byung*). The instruction that sngar dbang, (*sngar dbang rim pas bsten pa las*)—this is provisional method for recognizing arsing. The gnad: arising (*byung ba ni*) is not something created but recognized through appearance's teaching (*gnyis pa snang tshul*). Risk of technicism: treating "sngar dbang" as ritual technique rather than recognition-framework.>

[5170-5185]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE DIVIDING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: APPEARANCE-REIFICATION]

<The appearance-dividing teaching operates from *instructional provisionality* for structured recognition. Appearance's teaching (*gnyis pa snang tshul gyis*) dividing (*bye brag tu bshad pa la*)—this indicates that appearance is analyzed through teaching into separate components. Wisdom-lamp (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog gi snang ba dang*)—this refers to wisdom's five-color display as light (*'od*). Dibs's (*dbyibs kyi snang ba gnyis las*)—this indicates two modes of appearance: wisdom-lamp and affliction (*dang po ni*). The analysis: Vajra's, completely-pure (*rdo rje'i rigs rnam par dag pas*), fire, long-lata, seeing (*me long lta bu'i ye shes kyi rang 'od kha dog dkar po'i rnam par 'char ba dang*)—this describes how recognition (*mthong ba*) sees (*lta bu*) wisdom's self-resonance (*rang 'od*) as white (*dkar po*), appearing as completely pure (*rnam par dag*) like fire (*me*) and long-lata (*long*). Risk of appearance-reification: treating "fire" and "long-lata" as external objects rather than recognition-metaphors.>

[5185-5195]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – VISION-CLARITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: COLOR-REIFICATION]

<The vision-clarity teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Therefore (*de nyid rdo rje mi bskyod pa'i gdangs dkar ba la 'tsher bar 'char ba'o*)—this establishes that Vajra (*rdo rje*) not disturbing (*mi bskyod pa*) white (*dkar ba*) self-resonance (*gdangs*) arises (*'char ba*) as clarity. The gnad: that's (*de'i 'og tu*)—delusion (*de bzhin gshegs pa'i rigs rnam par dag pas*), Dharmata's, expanse (*chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes kha dog mthing ga'i rnam par 'char ba dang*)—within delusion (*'og tu*), the five wisdoms appear as Dharmata's expanse (*chos kyi dbyings*). The statement that appearance, completely-destroyed (*rnam par snang mdzad kyi gdangs mthing la gnag par 'char ro*)—this indicates that when delusion is destroyed (*snang mdzad*), appearance's clarity (*gdangs mthing*) destroys (*gnag par*) as black (*'char ro*). Risk of color-reification: treating "white" and "black" as colors rather than recognition-metaphors for clarity and obscurity.>

[5195-5205]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PRECIOUS FAMILIES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The precious-families (*rin po che'i rigs*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for understanding recognition's modes. Mnyam pa (*mnyam pa nyid kyi kha dog ser po'i snam bu dang*)—this describes the Mnyam pa (Akshobhya) family as red (*ser po*) wisdom. Rin Che's (*rin po che 'byung ldan gyi gdangs rab tu 'tsher ba*)—this indicates that the Amoghasiddhi (*rin po che*) family's self-resonance (*gdangs*) shines (*'tsher ba*) as gold (*gser zhun*). Dust (*sbyangs pa lta bur 'char ro*)—this describes the dust that obscures recognition (*lta bu*). The citation from Padma (*pad+ma'i rigs rnam par dag pa las*)—delusion (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes kyi kha dog dmar po'i snam bu dang*)—this indicates that delusion's wisdom appears as red (*dmar po*) people (*snam bu*). Risk of substantialism: treating "five families" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5205-5215]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – APPEARANCE COMPLETELY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: APPEARANCE-REIFICATION]

<The appearance-completely (*snang ba mtha' yas kyi*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The analysis that appearance, completely (*snang ba mtha' yas kyi gdangs dmar ba la rab tu dmar ba byi ru'i mdog lta bur 'char ro*)—this establishes that appearance's clarity (*gdangs*) is completely (*mtha' yas*) maroon (*dmar ba*) with appearance like (*byi ru'i mdog*). Action (*las kyi rigs rnam par dag pa las*)—this indicates that from the five action-families (*las kyi rigs*), appearance appears. Byung (*bya ba grub pa'i ye shes kyi kha dog ljang gu'i snam bur 'char ba dang*)—this indicates that byung (*bya ba grub*) wisdom's five-color (*kha dog*) appears as people (*snam bu*). Existing (*don yod grub pa'i gdangs rab ljang in+d+ra nI la'i rnam pa ltar 'char ba'o*)—this is the gnad: what exists (*don yod*) is established by (*grub pa*) wisdom's clarity (*gdangs rab ljang*), appearing as five people (*snam bur*). Risk of appearance-reification: treating "appearance as people" as external rather than recognition-display description.>

[5215-5225]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THEREFORE WISDOM]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: WISDOM-REIFICATION]

<The therefore-wisdom teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Therefore (*de dag gi phyi rim mthing ga rdo rje'i ra bas kun nas bskor ba ni*)—this establishes that from precious (*rin po che*) ground (*ra*) recognition surrounds (*bskor ba*) awareness (*ye shes*) completely (*kun nas*). Wisdom (*ye shes de dag tha dad pa ma yin par mtshon pa'o*)—these five wisdoms are not separate (*tha dad pa*) but appear as not-existing (*ma yin par*) recognition. From that (*de las snang ba'i 'phel ni*)—this indicates that from wisdom's self-resonance, appearance unfolds (*'phel*). Five-color's (*'od lnga so sos gtso byas pa'i kha dog lnga lngar gsal ba ni*)—the gnad is that five-color's (*kha dog lnga*) five colors (*lnga lngar*) are established as main (*gtso byas*). Risk of wisdom-reification: treating "five wisdoms" as external illuminations rather than recognition's own luminosity.>
