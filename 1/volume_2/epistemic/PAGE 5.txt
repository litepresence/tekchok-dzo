[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Instruction in "sound-meaning" of elements for attainment of siddhis belongs to tantric transformative methodology. The assertion that training in elemental sounds yields "common attainments" (powers, clairvoyance) is framed as expedient means, not definitive view. The Secret Conduct Seed Tantra citation establishes this as provisional path-methodology.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

Completeness (tshang tshul) teaching asserts primordial identity between life-cycle stages and enlightenment path. This operates from rigpa-side view where base, path, and result are simultaneously complete. Risk of view collapse if read as denying need for recognition/introduction—the text explicitly requires "instruction introduces" despite primordial completeness.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]

Direct negation of effort-based liberation: "Not liberated by effort—abiding liberated from primordial." Functions to clear misconception that dzogchen requires causal accumulation. The causal language (father-mother cause) that follows is explicitly provisional, immediately reframed as primordial abiding.
