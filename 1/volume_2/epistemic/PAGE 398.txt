[DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMPTY APPEARANCE MANIFESTATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<Essence empty appearance clear spontaneous presence from, kayas three appearance-mode clear, five lights wisdom's display, dharmakaya non-conceptual clear light, sambhogakaya five lights ornament wheel, emanation spheres light various forms, all self-appearances not other, natural expression clear light essence. Empty and clear inseparable: empty is not void but the capacity for appearance, clear is not substance but unobstructed manifestation. The ground is empty appearance, not empty then appearance. Risk of substantialism: treating appearance as emerging from or grounded in something substantial rather than recognizing empty-clear as inseparable.>
