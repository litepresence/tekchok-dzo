[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

Thogal visionary sequence: awareness drawn from eye (rig pa mig nas drangs pa), canopy tent (gur khyim), bindus (thig le), linked-chains (lu gu rgyud) coalescing into kayas. The epistemic stance describes natural arising of self-appearances (rang snang), not constructed visualization. Risk of practice misread as ontology if progressive visions are taken as objective metaphysical states rather than spontaneous self-liberation of awareness.
