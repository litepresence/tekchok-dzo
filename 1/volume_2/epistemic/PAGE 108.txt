<Masterful analysis:
The *Rang ngo rig pa* (Self-Face Awareness) citation—"Self-face awareness like a snake-knot—held in sky through free from going-coming"—and *Bstan bu* (Display) citation—"Within expanse, snake-knot, arranged but not separated"—establish the definitive Dzogchen view of awareness as self-knotted (*lu gu rgyud*), not externally constructed. The commentary explains: through slow-wind accomplishment, meaning free from activity arises in continuum; awareness-knot placed in "A" (*ar*) causes conceptual sources to exhaust, delusion returns to ground, mother-child wisdoms meet. "Awareness separated from wind, without going-coming, is awareness entering itself" (*rig pa rang la tshud pa*)—this is the crucial shift: recognition is not produced but discovered. The graduated practice description (body-key for five-six days, then gate-application, then field-search for six-seven days, then direct actual application) operates as *upāya* within definitive view: the "phases" are pedagogical scaffolding for those who benefit from structure, but the recognition itself is immediate. The Dzogchen integration: all practices converge on direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) of what has always been the case.>

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Masterful analysis:
The second section—"actual direct pointing of rigpa's self-face"—presents the direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) itself. Awareness as vajra-snake-knot, like golden thread hovering in sky, expanse-clear-light-appearance together—this unconfused buddha, primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance. Looking into state (*ngang la bltas*), all concept-creators pure, beyond elaboration like sky, radiance dawns within—knowing the meaning of non-dual expanse-rigpa, prajna-born wisdom meets face-to-face. This is not description of attainment but recognition-instruction: the "snake-knot" is awareness's self-coiled nature, never requiring unknotting; the "golden thread in sky" is the subtle self-radiance always present; the "meeting face-to-face" is the collapse of recognizer-recognized separation. The Dzogchen view: this "introduction" is not information transfer but the pointing that reveals awareness has never been other than what is pointed to.>
