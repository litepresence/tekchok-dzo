[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage operates from the rigpa-side, presenting direct recognition as already accomplished. The citations from Rang ngo rig pa and Bstan bu establish the self-arisen nature of awareness (rang byung rig pa) beyond coming and going. Longchenpa shifts from the previous page's instructional methods to the view of natural liberation: awareness "enters itself" (rang la tshud) when separated from wind. The epistemic stance is definitive and non-dual—there is no gradual process being described, but rather the nature as it is. The description of practice phases (five-six days for body key points, then gate, then field) appears within a framework where recognition is immediate and self-liberating. The passage marks a transition from sems-side methodology to rigpa-side declaration.>
