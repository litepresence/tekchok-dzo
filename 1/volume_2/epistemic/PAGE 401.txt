[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILIES PURE REALM]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIAL LITERALISM]

<Five families' field appearance, nature pure, five lights' appearance self-clear, great enjoyment five wisdoms' aspect engaging, afflictions' pain all free. These also from Jewel Heap: "Self-clear pure sambhogakaya, five lights pure measureless palace, elaboration-free great bliss speech, body five families' retinue, entity not pure dharmas, wisdom five gathered heart from issued." The five families' pure realm is the nature of mind, not a location. Risk of spatial literalism: reading this as geographical place rather than the spontaneous display of wisdom.>
