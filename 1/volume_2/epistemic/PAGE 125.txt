[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<Masterful analysis:
Birth-aging-sickness-death four's increase-decrease similar—outer container's disintegration, inner held sentient beings' lifespan measure upward-growing, downward-diminishing exhaustion sign. These not exhausted, self three realms not liberated. Thus outer container's world exhausted, support-ground nonexistent, returning-ground nonexistent crucial point; inner held sentient beings exhausted, birth-continuum ceasing, thus rigpa itself death-free. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "exhaustion" (*zad pa*) as annihilation rather than recognition of phenomena's empty nature. The Dzogchen view: "exhaustion" means phenomena are recognized as unborn, not destroyed.

Then appearance whatever essence also not established—"this is, this is not" difficult to express, called "dharmatā exhaustion," meaning's fruition. Fruition: person "this is, this is not" difficult to express, inconceivable. Dharmatā exhaustion: measure-reached time outer object inner body's phenomena with-obstacles exhausted, here all-ground consciousness's phenomena mind-gathered exhausted, all-ground's portion door-three's dharmatā abiding root ignorance that exhausted purifying; delusion's phenomena regarded, appearance's clear-light non-arising-ceasing that dharmatā ultimate abiding from, dharmatā those two exhausted coming—called "dharmatā exhaustion." Appearance: previously spontaneously present appearance existing, innerly dissolving, portion-portion gone time, primordial purity appearance cloud-free sky like naturally pure momentarily abiding—called "appearance," not entity and marks appearance. This time phenomena even not observable—dharmatā exhaustion: phenomena object, dharmatā that emptiness grasping-aspect object-possessor included, three realms' mind mental-events all-ground with returning time. Exhaustion manner: gradual and instantaneous two—gradual exhaustion four appearances measure-reached time; instantaneous exhaustion first dharmatā directly seeing familiarizing... [continues]. The Dzogchen integration: exhaustion is not process but recognition that phenomena have never been other than awareness's display.>
