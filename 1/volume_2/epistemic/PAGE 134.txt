[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BODY POSTURE KEY POINTS]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: POSTURAL REDUCTIONISM]

<Dharmakaya's posture seven: body straight like arrow, mind space dissolving, appearance mind not different, empty clear not grasping, rigpa fresh not dull, six consciousnesses naturally clear, experience without separation. These seven are key points of posture, not the recognition itself. Risk of postural reductionism: believing correct posture alone brings liberation rather than recognizing posture supports but does not constitute recognition.>
