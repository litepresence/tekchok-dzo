[RISK: EXPERIENCE-FIXATION]

<Masterful analysis:
The three types of experience (*nyams*)—past knowing's experience, emptiness-clarity extreme-free realization measure, wisdom potency included—arise from familiarization at beginning, middle, and end. First: body-speech controlled at crucial point, wind-mind latent, inner samādhi clear-light emptiness mode spreads, knowing vast without grasping-grasped bliss-joy broad releasing attachment arises, yet clinging-grasping not even hair-tip exists—this arises from naturally arriving at samādhi crucial point. Contrived meditation's bliss-joy arises as changed experience, much coarse shaking or singing-dancing desire arises, becoming attachment-clinging. This, though bliss-joy dawns, has the distinction of knowing self-power-obtained bliss-joy without clinging versus contrived meditation and naturally wind-arrived samādhi—know this distinction. Risk of experience-fixation: grasping at "bliss-joy" (*dga' bde*) as attainment rather than recognition-mark. The Dzogchen view: natural samādhi's bliss is not "happiness" but the absence of confusion—clinging cannot arise because there's no grasping-grasped duality.

Final-change experience (*mthar 'gyur gyi nyams*): wind-experience's appearance aspect—like fireflies, like clouds, like smoke, like mist, like moon rising, like stars rising, like dawn's blue appearance, like sun rising outer-inner unobstructed appearance—these eight, arising-ceasing, clarifying-dissolving, unstable, unmaintainable, changing-going, therefore called final-change experience, because wind-moving's experience. These are purifiable because wind-mind must be purified. Appearance experience (*snang ba'i nyams*): rigpa's self-radiance great clear-light, temporarily outer-appearance increasing reaching measure, self-radiance dissolving into ground, innerly returning, outer-clarity must dissolve, because spontaneously present primordial purity expanse must dissolve. Innerly clear in self-light expanse, rigpa body-wisdom palace primordially abiding spontaneously present great without change-transformation. Therefore here appearance experience is principal. The Dzogchen integration: these experiences are not achievements but recognition-marks; "principal" indicates their function as pointing-devices, not goals.>
