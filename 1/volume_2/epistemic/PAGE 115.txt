[5038-5079]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage cites Sgron ma 'bar ba (Blazing Lamp) and Thalgyur to establish the definitive view: dharmatā makes awareness's own field, the vajra is the hanging cord, and the result is liberation into equal-limitless (ngo mnyam ris med) nature. The epistemic stance is declarative finality—Longchenpa speaks from the rigpa-side where recognition is already complete. The description of outer, inner, and secret dimensions collapsing into wisdom's sky dissolving into dharmadhatu operates beyond conventional practice frameworks. The phrase "samsara name-empty, three realms corpse cut" (srid gsum gdar sha chod) indicates the non-dual view where all distinctions naturally liberate. This is not instruction on what to do but a pointing to the nature as it is. The transition from [5038-5062] to [5063-5079] shows a layered presentation: first the view, then its experiential expression through increasing visions (nyams snang gong 'phel).>
