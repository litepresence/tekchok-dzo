[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (Blazing Lamp) citation—"Expanse makes awareness's own field; vajra is the hanging cord; this placed within"—establishes definitive Dzogchen view through tantric imagery. The fruition (*'bras bu*) explanation: when outer expanse-appearance eye does not move in its own time, inner rigpa abides in ground, radiance self-dissolves returning, separated from spleen-wind's horse—wisdom's sky dissolves into expanse's sky, liberating as equal-limitless without category. This describes not attainment but recognition of ever-present nature. The Dzogchen view: primordial purity's rigpa not moving from expanse, heart-center naturally clear-light intention self-naturally abides—the yogi is called "dharmatā primordial clear-light captured," saṃsāra name-empty, three realms corpse cut. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation confirms: "Therefore dharmatā direct-appearance gnad—seeing merely knows, knowing realizes, realizing merely liberates. Liberation is not separate—sky dissolves into sky, nature unobservable, without category, without parts. Directly found fortune-possessor, three-realm saṃsāra name-empty, three realms corpse cut." This is definitive pointing: liberation is not result of practice but recognition of nature's already-liberated state.

<Masterful analysis:
The experience-increasing appearance (*nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba*) section presents the experiential dimension of recognition. Briefly taught: expanse-rigpa upwardly increasingly purified, outer expanse-appearance rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides; inner primordial purity empty-expanse self-radiance rigpa-expanse non-dually abides, clear-light mother-child meet, various appearance-experiences increase. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Experience-appearance increase upward is—wisdom color outwardly arising, upright-standing and spokes arise, various thigle as body, clear to appearing object's field." This is not "progress" in conventional sense but the natural unfoldment of recognition. Extensively explained: experience-increase's experience two—knowing's experience and... [continues]. The Dzogchen view: "increasing" is not accumulation but the clearing of obscurations revealing what was always present. Experience (*nyams*) is not achievement but the natural radiance of recognition when confusion self-liberates.>
