[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: THAL 'GYUR-REIFICATION]

<The Thal 'Gyur purification teaching (*thal 'gyur las*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The instruction that purification is purification (*de ltar phebs nas rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this establishes that recognition is purified through elimination of afflictions (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*), not through accumulation of virtues. The gnad that therefore afflictions (*dngos pa'i*) exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this is definitive: delusion has never truly existed to eliminate. Risk of Thal 'Gyur reification: treating "Thal 'Gyur purification" as ritual practice rather than natural recognition of primordial purity.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILIES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: FAMILIES-REIFICATION]

<The five-families teaching (*thad ka'i dngos snang 'gags pa dang*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for structured path. The teaching that also (*yang*) five precious ones (*rin po che*)—this indicates that Buddha-families manifest as five qualities. The gnad: wisdom's wind (*ye shes kyi rlung*) completely pure (*rnam par dag*) seeing recognition's appearance (*snang ba*)—this establishes that wisdom's wind (*ye shes*) is recognition's own luminosity appearing as five families. The gnad that recognition appears (*snang ba'i*), exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i*)—this indicates that when wisdom's purity manifests, recognition recognizes its appearance and delusion is exhausted. Risk of five-families reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION RESTING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: WISDOM-REIFICATION]

<The recognition-resting teaching (*rig pa mig nas drangs pa las byung ba'o*) operates from *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side*. The gnad: recognition sees (*rig pa mig*) and rests (*drangs pa las*)—this indicates that recognition looks through eyes (*mig*) and rests in nature. This is not gradual stabilization but direct recognition of awareness's nature. The statement that therefore wisdom's wind completely pure seeing recognition's appearance—this establishes that recognition's resting causes wisdom to see its own display directly. The gnad that depending on (*brten nas*), recognition's experience (*nyams*) spontaneously arises (*'phel 'byung ba'o*)—this establishes that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. Risk of wisdom reification: treating "wisdom" as separate entity rather than awareness's luminous quality.>

[RISK: QUALITY-REIFICATION]

<The five-qualities teaching operates from *sems-side*. The statement that wisdom's five-qualities (*ye shes kyi rlung rnam par dag*) seeing recognition's appearance (*mthong bas*)—this is provisional: practitioners recognize recognition appearing as five wisdom-families (*ye shes lnga*). The gnad that therefore cognition gathers (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that when recognition arises, cognition (*sor rtog pa*) gathers (*gru*) completely (*chad du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba*). Risk of quality reification: treating "five qualities" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-display descriptions.>

[RISK: EXHAUSTION-REIFICATION]

<The delusion-exhaustion teaching (*'khrul pa'i snang ba zad du*) operates from *sems-side*. The statement that all wisdom (*nye ba*) wisdom's (*nyid do*)—this is *upāya* for practitioners: delusion (*'khrul pa*) and wisdom (*nyid do*) are not separate entities; delusion is exhausted (*zad*). The gnad that therefore cognition gathers (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that when recognition arises, cognition gathers completely recognition's appearance. The teaching that arising's precious qualities time (*byung ba'i phra ba 'gag pa'i dus so*)—this is provisional describing how precious qualities (*'gag pa*) manifest over time (*dus so*). Risk of exhaustion reification: treating "delusion-exhaustion" as gradual achievement rather than recognition of what was never established.>

[RISK: WISDOM-REIFICATION]

<The recognition-wisdom teaching (*bya ba grub pa'i re lde'i rnam pa tsam du snang ba ni*) operates from *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side*. Arising (*bya ba*) established (*grub pa*) emptiness (*stong ldan gyi*) recognition's appearance (*rnam pa*)—this is provisional teaching that recognition appears as wisdom (*re lde*). The gnad that wisdom's self-resonance completely shines (*ye shes kyi rang gdangs so sor gsal ba las byung ba'o*)—this establishes that wisdom (*ye shes*) is awareness's (*rig pa*) own self-resonance (*rang gdangs*) that shines (*gsal ba*) spontaneously (*las byung ba*). The statement that therefore dharmata's wisdom from space displays (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes mkhar thab tu 'char ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings ye shes*) appears as space's (*mkhar thab*) display (*'char ba*). Risk of wisdom reification: treating "wisdom" as separate quality rather than awareness's self-knowing.>

<The six-accumulations teaching (*de las 'khor lo la sogs pa'i rnam pa sna tshogs su*) operates from *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. Therefore action (*de las*) of going around (*'khor lo*)—six accumulations (*rnam pa sna tshogs su*) appear (*snang ba ni*) and go (*sngon 'gro*) through awareness's meditative observation (*mthar phyin pa*) and arise (*las byung ba*)—this describes how recognition perceives six accumulations as they appear and dissolve. The gnad that therefore action of appearance recognition going liberates (*de las dra bar snang ba ni sngon du 'gro ba tshad du phyin pa las byung ba'o*)—this is key: when action (*las*) is applied to appearance (*dra bar*), recognition (*snang ba ni*) going into (*sngon 'gro*) recognition (*tshad du phyin pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of accumulation reification: treating "six accumulations" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-descriptions of experience modes.>

The gnad: (*gzigs*) looking (*stangs las*) establishes (*grus pa*) and (*byung ba*)—this indicates that recognition's "looking" (*gzigs*) is key: seeing recognition's own appearance. The gnad that therefore dharmata's wisdom object gathering recognition (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes yul gru tsam du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings ye shes*) object (*yul*) gathering (*gru tsam du*) recognition (*snang ba ni*)—this is provisional describing recognition's relationship to dharmata.

Therefore action (*de las*) of clearing (*sbyangs pa*) arises (*las byung ba*)—this is provisional teaching that recognition's clearing arises spontaneously. The gnad that established six accumulations all exhausted (*brtson 'grus rab rnams la bar du zhag lnga'o*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes accumulation's exhaustion (*zhag lnga*), this is not a gradual process but definitive recognition. The gnad that established action seeing going completely liberates (*brtson 'grus pa las pad+ma stong ldan du 'char ba ni sngon 'gro 'byongs pa las byung ba'o*)—this is comprehensive: established (*brtson 'grus*) action (*pa las*), Padma (*pad+ma*) emptiness (*stong ldan*), seeing (*du 'char ba ni*), going (*sngon 'gro*), completely (*'byongs pa*), liberating (*las byung ba*). Risk of action reification: treating "clearing" and "liberation" as separate practices rather than recognition-description.>
