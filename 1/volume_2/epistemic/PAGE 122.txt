[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The passage presents the signs of completion (rdzogs pa'i tshad) and the maturation of the rainbow body ('ja' lus) as natural expressions of primordial purity. The epistemic stance is definitive—Longchenpa cites Thalgyur to establish that these are not achievements but spontaneous manifestations of recognition. The detailed descriptions of light rays from the heart center, crown, urna, and fingers function within a framework where form and emptiness are non-dual. However, readers risk reifying these phenomena as ontologically real transformations of the physical body or as attainments to be achieved. The passage operates from the rigpa-side: the "eight doors of spontaneous presence" (lhun grub kyi sgo brgyad) and the mandalas appearing in body parts are presented as self-display (rang snang), not as constructed experiences. The distinction between ordinary and pure perception collapses in this view.>
