[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Passage employs radical negation: no finding-time, no achievement, no destruction. The "sinking boat" metaphor operates as negational clearing—not asserting non-existence but undermining the framework of existence/non-existence itself. Samantabhadra's three obstructions function as direct pointing, not doctrinal claim. The epistemic stance refuses positive ascription to primordial nature while clearing reification of "mindlessness" as a state.>
