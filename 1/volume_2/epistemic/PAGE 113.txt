[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: STAGE-FETISHISM]

<Masterful analysis:
The threefold structure—inner dharmatā-object gnad, arising-producing door gnad, wind-abiding gnad—clears the path; while secretly, familiarization measure sequence, ripening signs sequence, and final exhaustion sequence determine measure. Ripening thigle, completion body, and three thus complete fruition—therefore called "three" through three-set fourfold definiteness. Alternatively: dharmatā's three kayas spontaneously present self-radiance-appearance three outwardly arising number—Dharmakaya's self-radiance inner experience rigpa-emptiness, Sambhogakaya's self-radiance five lights outwardly clear wisdom self-clarity, Nirmanakaya's self-radiance arise-liberate without category prajñā potency together—considering these three. Risk of stage-fetishism: interpreting these "three" as mandatory sequential stages rather than recognition-modalities. The Dzogchen view: ground-three establishes ground-control, therefore entities without difference's crucial point; path-three clears obstacles, therefore near-far without difference in migration-path; measure-three reaches measure, therefore different/non-different without chaos; fruition-three brings to exhaustion-point, therefore existent/non-existent and doubt without—this is called "direct." Ordinary times see pleasure/non-pleasure/indifferent, therefore pleasure-pain-between three arise; guru's instruction practice times see expanse-rigpa-dharma three directly. Dharmatā direct-appearance has no intellectual analysis word superimposition crucial point; familiarization times see light-thigle-three-kayas, therefore delusion-appearance self-ceases; measure-reached times see clarity-emptiness-bliss three directly, therefore dharmatā self-exhausts. Thus "three" through number's ground-other-dependence certainly liberates fruition simultaneously—this is direct recognition beyond stages.

The nature of dharmatā direct-appearance: whatever appears is dharmatā-appearance; whatever object it appears to is expanse-appearance; however it appears is light-light-enclosure-rigpa-snake-knot together. Experiencing that appearance makes fruition with-obstacles non-appear buddha. Thus dharmatā direct-appearance's essence is expanse-rigpa-clear-light-appearance.>
