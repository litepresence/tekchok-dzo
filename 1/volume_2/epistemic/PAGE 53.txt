[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Masterful analysis:
Detailed presentation of subtle body correlations (*rtsa rlung thig le*) operating within *tantric transformative view*. These physiological mappings function as contemplative technology rather than anatomical claims. Risk: practitioners may literalize channels, winds, and drops as physical realities rather than symbolic coordinates for awareness-recognition. The Dzogchen integration views these as dimensions of single awareness-display.>
