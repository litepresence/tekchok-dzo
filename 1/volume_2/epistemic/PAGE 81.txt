[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Masterful analysis:
Definitive Dzogchen view from the perspective of *rig pa* (awareness). The assertions operate with *declarative finality* (*nges don*), directly identifying phenomena as wisdom-display without intermediate stages. The Wylie terms indicate atemporal recognition rather than sequential development. This is not philosophical idealism but phenomenological description of awareness's self-recognition.>
