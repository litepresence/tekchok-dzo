[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKĀYA POSTURE AS FEARLESSNESS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: FORMALISM]

That reversed, outer confused-appearance ceases, inner body-mind heat arises! Both palms earth joining, changing karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer thigle and thigle-drop dawns, inner day-night without experience arises! Neck mind slightly embrace, grasping karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer body's appearance seen, inner wind's movement exhausts! Dharmakāya's dwelling also: sound explained: "Lion three powers complete, to any not fear," body vital-point three realms' fear dispels!

[CONTEXT] POSTURE SYMBOLISM: The "lion posture" (*seng ge*) represents the Dharmakāya stance—fearless, unmoving, and all-vanquishing. This triad of postures (elephant for Sambhogakāya, lion for Dharmakāya) mirrors the three-kāya structure in somatic form, a characteristic Nyingma *snying thig* teaching.

Meaning's manner division also: continuous joining vital-point: body dog-joint sitting, expanse and awareness joining makes! Sole feet earth pressing, various conceptions cease! Hand's fingers joints bent, feet two's inner side inserted, karma and afflictions' movement empties! Upper body hollow placed, always dharmatā not separate makes! Root neck placed, dharmatā's meaning not moving support makes! Second, resting wisdom's vital-point: both soles earth placed, knee slightly outer, dog-joint sitting—pervasive karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer wisdom direction pure appearance seen, inner afflictions' stream bundle ceases! Both palms inner side inserted, grasping karma-wind ceases!

Risk: Formalism—taking postures as ritual forms rather than direct recognition supports.
