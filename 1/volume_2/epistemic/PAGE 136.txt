<Ten perfections transformed through emptiness wisdom—conduct and accumulation recontextualized from gradual path methodology. The merchant/clouds metaphors mark the shift from transactional to non-grasping engagement. "Merit becomes not-grasping" indicates view-transformation rather than practice-replacement. Epistemic stance: upāya for integrating gradual vehicle conduct with Dzogchen view.>
