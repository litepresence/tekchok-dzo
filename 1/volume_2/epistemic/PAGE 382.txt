[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AGGREGATES DISSOLUTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ANNIHILATIONISM]

<Earth completely nirvana, feeling aggregate pure. Fire completely nirvana, consciousness aggregate pure. Wind completely nirvana, compositional factors aggregate pure. Second, wisdom dharmadhatu dissolved: five afflictions five wisdoms pure self-resonance five inner dharmadhatu clear light dissolved, deep resonance five color's ground abiding. From Six Expanse: self-resonance moved white part, deep clarity great itself abides. The dissolution of aggregates into dharmadhatu is not annihilation but purification. Risk of annihilationism: mistaking dissolution for destruction rather than recognition of purity.>
