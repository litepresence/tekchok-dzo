[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: INTELLECTUALIZATION]

<The definitive teaching on relationship (*rnam 'grel*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening statement—from all phenomena, mind gathered and within that, self-nature ego-less (*thams cad las ni sems bsdus nas nang gi bdag nyid g.yo med par*)—establishes definitive ground: all dharmas are mind-display; within that display, self-nature is ego-less, not something to establish. The statement that seeing with eyes the body, and intention causes self-grasping's intention to arise (*gnas na'ang mig gis gzugs dag ni mthong ba'i blo de dbang skyes yin*)—this is *instructional provisionality* describing how ordinary cognition operates, not the definitive mode. The instruction that intention should settle into expanse (*don dam dbyings la 'jal ba'i mngon sum*) is skillful means (*upāya*) for redirecting self-grasping toward recognition. The crucial gnad: awareness's essence is dharmata itself (*rig pa'i ngo bo chos nyid snying ga na yod par nges te*)—this establishes that awareness is not some phenomenon but the nature of all phenomena. Risk of intellectualization: treating "mind gathering" as mental process rather than recognizing awareness's primordial state.>

[4927-4943]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-RESONANCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<The self-resonance (*rang gdangs*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The description that from its self-resonance, heart (*de'i rang gdangs snying nas*) connecting with eyes outer self-display and light-resonance (*mig tu 'brel ba'i phyir nyi ma dang 'od zer bzhin rgyu 'bras nges pa*)—this establishes that recognition is aware of its own display as itself (*rang snang*), not subject-object relationship. The "outer self-display" (*nyi ma*) refers to awareness's capacity to manifest; "light-resonance" (*'od zer*) refers to luminous quality. The citation from *Rang Byung* continues: from appearance and cessation two (*'jig rten pa dang 'das pa gnyis las 'di ni*) this is cessation-gnosis (*'das pa'i mngon sum mo*). Risk of reification: treating "self-resonance" and "light-resonance" as subtle energies to cultivate rather than descriptions of awareness's self-knowing quality.>

[4943-4953]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR TEACHINGS]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The four-teaching presentation (*chos nyid kyi sgra nye bar sbyar ba la bzhi las*) operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured analysis. The four teachings are: (1) circle with phenomena (*'khor ba la chos*)—teaching within cyclic existence; (2) meditation (*myang 'das chos nyid*)—teaching on passing beyond; (3) emptiness with phenomena (*stong pa la chos nyid*)—teaching on emptiness of dharmas; (4) no gnad (*gnad med pas mi grol ba la chos*)—teaching on liberation. The statement that therefore exists liberation (*yod pas grol nges pas chos nyid du grags pa'i 'di chos nyid do*)—this is definitive declaration: liberation is not through gnad-accomplishment but through recognizing chos nyid. The gnad that awareness-grasping is non-separated (*rig pa la chos nyid du grags pa'i gnyis ka dbyer med du 'dod pa'o*) establishes that awareness never grasps at phenomena as other. Risk of substantialism: treating "four teachings" as separate doctrines rather than recognition-descriptions from different angles.>

[4953-4965]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AFFLICTION-OBJECT]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: NIHILISM]

<The affliction (*mngon pa*) analysis operates from two perspectives. First, definitive: affliction is affliction's object (*dbang po'i spyod yul la dngos su bltar yod pa'o*)—this describes delusion's function as grasping at phenomena as truly existent. Second, provisional: also not relying on intellect (*de'ang yid dpyod la ma ltos pa ste*) whenever wisdom analyzes (*yid dpyod kyi shes rab kyis gang du btsal yang rnyed pa'i dus med do*)—this is *upāya* describing the limitation of intellect: wisdom never finds anything to eliminate because nothing truly exists to eliminate. The statement that not possessing mind and light, possessing light is not (*tshol mkhan mig can ma yin 'od gsal gzugs can ma yin pa'i phyir te*)—this operates from *sems-side* to dispel clinging to form. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "nothing to eliminate" as mere absence rather than recognition of primordial state.>

[4965-4984]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FRAGILITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The analysis of fragile (*phra ba rdul phran dang rags pa*) phenomena operating from definitive *rigpa-side* establishes that phenomena appear as fragile, impermanent, and without essence but are grasped at as having self-nature (*dngos po rang mtshan du 'di med pa'i phyir*). The teaching that from expanse (*sdud pa las*) wisdom analyzes (*shes rab kyis ni brtags na*) the affliction's basis (*phung po'i gting mi rnyed*)—this indicates that recognition sees through phenomena's lack of essence, it does not eliminate anything. The statement that light-display is not having form-possessing (*'od gsal gyi snang ba 'di tha snyad la grags pa'i gzugs can ma yin te*)—this is definitive: awareness's display never possesses form as inherent quality. Risk of view collapse: mixing sutric negation ("phenomena are fragile") with Dzogchen recognition ("awareness sees through lack of essence")—the former is provisional, the latter is definitive.>

[4984-5008]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE POINTS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TECHNICISM]

<The three-points gnad (*lus ngag yi gsum gyi gnad gsum gyis gzhi bca' ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The instruction that body, speech, and mind's three points establish the basis (*gzhi bca' ba*)—this is not to create basis but to recognize that recognition's expression through body-speech-mind is already the basis. The statement therefore (*phyir ro*)—form-possessing (*gzugs can*) is breaking, spoiling (*gzhig cing gzhom rung du yod de gzugs kyi mtshan nyid de yin pa'i phyir ro*)—establishes that phenomena's apparent self-nature is their fragility, not an intrinsic quality. The three points are recognition-coordinates, not techniques to apply. The gnad: form-possessing's essence is that (*gzugs kyi mtshan nyid de yin pa'i phyir ro*)—points to recognition of what form actually is (display) versus what it appears to be (possessing essence). Risk of technicism: treating "three points" as structural exercises rather than recognition-descriptions.>
