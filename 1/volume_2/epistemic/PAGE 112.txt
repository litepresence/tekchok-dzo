[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: INTELLECTUALISM]

<Masterful analysis:
The *Rnam 'grel* (Pramāṇavārttika) citation—"Having gathered all into mind, though abiding unmoved in inner self-nature, the eye sees forms—that knowing is born from faculty"—is appropriated within Dzogchen to support direct recognition, not analysis. The commentary explains: ultimate expanse-encountering direct appearance is rigpa's essence dharmata abiding in heart-center; its self-radiance connects from heart to eye, therefore encountering with certainty through cause-effect like sun and sun-rays. This is not Dharma-kīrti's original intent (which concerns epistemology), but Dzogchen's radical recontextualization: the "direct appearance" is not sense-perception but awareness's self-recognition. Risk of intellectualism: taking this as philosophical argument rather than pointing-instruction. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "mind gathered" (*sems bsdus*) means recognition of awareness's non-dual nature, not mental concentration; "unmoved self-nature" means awareness never departs from its own state; "eye sees" means awareness's self-radiance appears without external object. The distinction from worldly and transcendent—the latter having expressed-object knowing as principal, mind's causal certainty, versus this having crucial-point pressing/seeing as principal, rigpa's direct appearance—establishes this as "transcendent direct appearance," not ordinary perception.

The fourfold *chos nyid* (dharmatā) analysis: (1) *'khor ba la chos*—samsara's phenomena; (2) *snang ba la chos, stong pa la chos nyid*—appearance as phenomenon, emptiness as dharmatā; (3) *gnad med pas mi grol, yod pas grol nges pas chos nyid*—without crucial point not liberated, with it certainly liberated, therefore called dharmatā; (4) *dbyings la chos, rig pa la chos nyid*—expanse as phenomenon, rigpa as dharmatā, considered non-dually. These are pedagogical scaffoldings dissolving into recognition that "dharmatā" is merely a label for awareness's nature, not an ontological category. "Direct appearance" (*mngon sum*) means actually existing as sense-faculty's domain object—yet not depending on intellectual analysis (*yid dpyod*). Prajñā's analysis searches but never finds the time—"the searcher is not eye-possessing, because clear-light is not form-possessed" (*Skt. Samcaya*). The clear-light-appearance is not conventionally-renowned form-possessed: without subtle atoms or coarse entity individual-characteristics, not destroyed/demolished by four-elements' harm—unlike form-possessed which can be destroyed because it has form-characteristic. The Dzogchen view: direct appearance of dharmatā is not "seen" like external object but recognized as awareness's own nature, beyond intellectual analysis yet immediately present.>
