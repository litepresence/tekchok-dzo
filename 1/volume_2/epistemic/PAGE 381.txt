[DZOGCHEN VIEW – ELEMENTS PURIFICATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ALCHEMICAL LITERALISM]

<Impure five elements pure five wisdoms' great elements appearance visible relying, pure result divisions arranged. Also wind vajra cross arrangement good, samaya goddess sky coiling unmoved wind dharmadhatu dissolved. Earth jewel five's stupa even balanced manner abiding, hard not earth dharmadhatu dissolved. Water crystal wheel stacked good, karma and afflictions' part free, moist not water dharmadhatu dissolved. Fire lotus net light blazing, unripened ripened made, hot not fire dharmadhatu dissolved. Space pure dharmata expanse vast, primordially pure impure delusion opening space dharmadhatu dissolved. Outer objects, inner body, aggregates elements and sense-bases etc. dharmas all pure, wisdom jewel's essence empty all-arising mandala expanse. The elemental purification is metaphorical, not alchemical transformation. Risk of alchemical literalism: treating these as literal elemental transmutations rather than recognition of wisdom nature.>
