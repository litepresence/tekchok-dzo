[NON-ASSERTIVE VIEW]
[NEGATIONAL CLEARING]
[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<Rangshar citation: radical negation of view-meditation-conduct framework. "No view, no meditation, no conduct" operates as negational clearing, not positive assertion of absence. "Without accomplishment, without aspiration" undermines teleological structure. "Doer and doing—where are they?" dismantles agent-action ontology. The mirror metaphor ("polish a mirror already clean") points to recognition without modification. Epistemic stance: non-assertive refusal of all positions—risk of misreading as license for non-practice.>
