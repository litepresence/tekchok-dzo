[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BUBBLES IN EYES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PHENOMENAL ILLUSION]

<Bubbles in eyes—wisdom self-appearance who not seen? From Jewel Garland: "This also quality gem, Again quality this-like." Two-non-existent self-dissolving, river space analogies. Water drops indistinguishable yet flowing, space no separation. Two-non-existent both extremes dissolved, single-one free from elaboration. All bodies speeches continuums exhaust into nirvana by self-dissolving. Extreme self pure—like space dissolving into space. The analogies point to non-dual recognition, not phenomenal illusion. Risk of phenomenal illusion: treating appearances as merely illusory rather than wisdom-display.>
