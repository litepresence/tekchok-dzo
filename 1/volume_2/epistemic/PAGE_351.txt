[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO RECOGNITION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALIZATION]

Heap-appearance ceases; momentary spontaneous presence appearance ceases; momentary primordial purity truth seen! Emanation from primordial purity ground not separate—path all empowerments' suchness obtained; like shooting star sky-running mode, shooting star that light-radiates similar, emanation emanated beings' benefit done. Benefit done in three days possible.

[CONTEXT] BARDO DOCTRINE: The reference to "three days" (*zhag gsum*) indicates the *snying thig* teaching on the duration of the bardo state. Unlike common Buddhist views of 49 days, Dzogchen asserts recognition can occur instantaneously or within three days for those with supreme faculties. The "shooting star" (*skar mda'*) simile appears in *Sgra thal 'gyur* as the sudden flash of recognition amidst darkness.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FACULTY-PERFECTION PATH]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: FACULTY ELITISM]

Supreme faculties' tip: one day bardo dwells! Also four wisdom conjunctions' appearance self-appearance seen—also from own eye wisdom fire two arisen, weapons fall from mouth, appearance ceaseless dawns, there self-awareness awakened, own sphere seen, spontaneous presence ground certainty obtained; again shooting star-like should be known! Supreme faculties' best: two days become Buddha! Also heap-appearance one day dwells—also from own heart wisdom sun one dawns, from that light-rays directions radiate! From that light-ray tips each one thus-come body dawns! That appearance's entire sphere body's nature seen!

Epistemic precision: The "four wisdom conjunctions" (*ye shes bzhi sbyor*) refer to the progressive visions (*snang ba bzhi*) of thod rgal practice. The path described is "instantaneous" (*cig car*) for supreme faculties, recognizing self-appearance as wisdom-display. Risk: Faculty elitism—interpreting "supreme faculties" as ontological hierarchy rather than recognition-readiness.
