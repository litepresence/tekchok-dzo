[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PATH AND FRUITION UNITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TELEOLOGICAL CONFUSION]

<Path appearance path fruition's manner path also is, that from open appearance wisdom path manner fruition also is. From Self-Arisen: "Dharmakaya within spontaneous presence's essence kadag that path manner fruition also is." Path three: essence path dharmakaya's manner is, nature path sambhogakaya's manner is, compassion path emanation's manner is. These three one nature's different aspects, dharmakaya spontaneous presence, sambhogakaya light rays appearance, emanation wisdom's compassion's compassion's manifestations three limitless. The unity of path and fruition transcends teleological development. Risk of teleological confusion: treating the path as leading to a future fruition rather than recognizing their non-dual nature.>
