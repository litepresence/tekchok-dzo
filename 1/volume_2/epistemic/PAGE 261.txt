[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

Systematic categorical framework (dbye ba, rgyu, gnas, 'bras bu) presenting deity forms (lha'i rnam pa), peaceful/wrathful kayas (zhi khro), and mandala structures. The epistemic stance is provisional scaffolding for generation-completion (bskyed rdzogs) practice, not definitive view. Risk of view collapse if structural categories are reified as ontological truths rather than transformative supports.
