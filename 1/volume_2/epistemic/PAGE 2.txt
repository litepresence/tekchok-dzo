[57-69]
[STRUCTURAL TRANSITION]
[TENFOLD FRAMEWORK]

<Structural outline of tenfold analysis (essence, terminology, purpose, characteristics, etc.) operates as pedagogical scaffolding. This framework itself is provisional organizational device, not ontological claim about nature of elements.>

[70-87]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Assertion that outer appearing elements are "play of inner elements" establishes non-dual view, but risk of collapse into idealism (claiming outer is "just" inner projection). The view here is not that outer reduces to inner, but that both are equally ungraspable display.>

[88-99]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

<Etymological analysis of "great element" (*'byung ba chen po*) operates from provisional sems-based entry. The seven definitions (spontaneously accomplished, producer, pervasive, simultaneous, self-existing, unchanging, harmonious appearance) build conceptual framework leading to direct recognition.>

[100-127]
[SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]
[RISK: REIFICATION]

<Detailed functional analysis of elements (water cleansing, earth supporting, fire maturing, wind moving) presented as purpose (*dgos pa*) operates from conventional view. Risk: taking functional descriptions as establishing inherent nature of elements rather than dependent arising. The practical applications (warming/cooling knowing, body/mind abiding) are provisional entry points, not definitive view.>

[128-129]
[STRUCTURAL TRANSITION]

<Transition to characteristics section. Structural marker indicating progression through tenfold framework.>
