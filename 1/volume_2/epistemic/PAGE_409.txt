[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE KAYA DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MULTIPLICATIVE REIFICATION]

<From Lion Perfected Great Perfection Tantra: "Buddhas' body and, speech and mind mandala and, qualities activity five appearance." Second: body and, speech and, mind and, qualities and, activity five's thorough divisions. The five are classifications of one display, not five separate things. Risk of multiplicative reification: counting body, speech, mind, qualities, activity as five distinct existences rather than descriptions of non-dual ground.>
