[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
The seven aspects of Dharmakaya fruition—spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) as great primordial liberation (*ye grol chen po*), primordially established (*ye grub*) activity completing all meanings, qualities abiding in oneself without seeking—are not achievements but recognition-descriptions. The verse citation presents the non-action of Dharmakaya: conduct without ceasing, fixation, or attachment; meditation spontaneous, immediate, without wavering; view complete without seeing or having-seen; fruition without fabrication, arising, or production; activity without cultivation, yet cultivation complete; qualities arising as one, two, all. Each line denies conventional action (*byed pa*) while asserting completion (*rdzogs*). This is Dzogchen's paradox: nothing to do, yet everything complete; no practice, yet recognition perfect. The Wylie phrases *byas med, byung med, 'byung ba med* (without fabrication, without arising, without production) negate *samskrta* (conditioned) categories, while *bsgrubs zin* (already established) points to *nisprapanca* (unelaborated) nature. The practitioner does not "accomplish" these—recognition reveals they were never absent.>

[STRUCTURAL TRANSITION]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Masterful analysis:
The structural marker *gnyis pa* (second) transitions from Dharmakaya to Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*), from emptiness-form to enjoyment-form. The fivefold analysis—essence (*ngo bo*), definitive terminology (*nges tshig*), characteristic (*mtshan nyid*), mode of appearance (*snang lugs*), mode of abiding (*gnas lugs*)—replicates scholastic methodology while preparing for Dzogchen transformation. The *Rang Shar* citation describes Sambhogakaya essence: birth existing yet possessing deathless vajra; five lights, bodies unobscured, individually clear; possessing five fathers, five objects, five aggregates; five innate aspects, five wisdoms, five realizations; five bases, five paths, five fruitions. This operates as *upāya*: the apparent multiplicity of Sambhogakaya's qualities serves as recognition-support for practitioners who cognize through differentiation. The Dzogchen integration recognizes that these "fives" are not categories to accumulate but simultaneous dimensions of single awareness-display. The transition from Dharmakaya's non-action to Sambhogakaya's apparent multiplicity marks pedagogical progression: from the simplicity of emptiness to the richness of spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*).>
