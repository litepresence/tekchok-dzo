<The *Thal 'Gyur* (Penetration of Sound) citation on speech training (*ngag bslab pa*)—"Speech is trained (*ngag ni bslab*), abides (*gnas pa*), and la bzla is stabilized (*la bzla brtan par bya*)"—presents graduated *upāya* for practitioners whose predominant pattern is speech/desire (bird-type). The four phases constitute a precise pedagogical progression: (1) Training (*bslab pa*): first reduce speaking, cutting ordinary conversation (*tha mal gyi gtam smra ba bcad pa*), beginning with short sessions (*thun chung ngu*) then extending to longer periods (*de nas ring du bslab*); even when no occasion for speaking, speak only one word (*skabs su smra rgyu med kyang gcig pu smra'o*). (2) Abiding (*gnas pa*): do not reject mantras and virtuous speech (*sngags dang brjod pa la sogs pa dge ba'i brjod pa mi dgag*), yet do not mix even a single syllable with others (*gzhan dang tshig 'bru gcig kyang mi 'dre'o*). (3) Recitation (*la bzla*): all mantra-recitation and expressions cease (*sngags la sogs pa brjod pa thams cad mi bya*). (4) Stabilization (*brtan pa*): without speaking anything, not departing from that state (*ci yang mi brjod pa'i ngang las mi 'da' bar byed pa*), not even using body-gestures (*lus kyi brda tsam yang mi bya*). The phrase "at this time" (*'di'i dus na*) indicates that during this process, one understands the meaning of body-signs (*lus kyi brda don go bar byed*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for gradual path practitioners. Risk of asceticism: interpreting this as value of silence itself rather than recognition-support. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "cutting speech" is not suppression but recognition that speech has never been other than awareness's self-expression.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ESSENTIALIZING NON-SPEECH]

<The *Sa bon gyi rgyud* (Seed Tantra) citation operates from definitive *rigpa-side* pointing to the ultimate nature of speech training. The citation—"Speech (*ngag*), however blocked (*ji ltar lkug pa bzhin*), without any sign-making with anyone (*su dang brda tsam nyid mi bya*), thus, whoever does this, mind's scattering and gathering self-decides (*sems kyi 'phro 'du rang chod do*)"—establishes that speech-training ultimately reveals the self-liberated nature of mind. The phrase "scattering and gathering" (*'phro 'du*) refers to mind's ordinary movement of thought: scattering outward (*'phro*) toward objects and gathering inward (*'du*) as mental engagement. The phrase "self-decides" (*rang chod do*) means that this movement naturally self-resolves, not through suppression but through recognition that movement and stillness are not truly separate. The reference to "however blocked" (*ji ltar lkug pa*) indicates that the method of blocking speech is provisional; the definitive point is that speech's nature has never needed blocking. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*): the recognition that speech, thought, and awareness are one nature (*ngo bo gcig*). Risk of essentializing non-speech: treating "silence" as ultimate state rather than recognizing that speech itself is awareness-display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "sign-making" (*brda tsam*) refers to all dualistic conceptualization; "without any sign-making" means recognizing beyond all concepts, not literal absence of communication.>

[RISK: ACCOMPLISHMENT-SEEKING]

<The progression from speech-training to body-training to mind-training represents tantric subtle body methodology leading toward Dzogchen recognition. The elaborate description of training effects operates as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from gradual path. The first effect—through cutting speech (*ngag gi smra ba bcad pa*), the unspeakable meaning (*brjod du med pa'i don*) arises in the continuum (*rgyud la skye ste*)—indicates that meaning transcends expression not because speech stops but because recognition realizes the unspeakable nature of all expression. The second effect—through not mixing speech with others (*'gro ba gzhan dang ngag ma 'dres pa*), body is trained (*lus 'byongs pa'i dgos pa yod*)—establishes the necessity of body training: without body-training, buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot bless (*sangs rgyas dang byang chub sems dpa' ... byin gyis brlabs nas*). Body becomes trained as illusory body liberated (*lus sgyu ma'i skur grol*), indicating that the body recognized as illusion-display. The third effect—through cutting expressed-objects (*brjod bya bkag pa*), speech is trained (*ngag 'byongs*), and signs appear: meeting with non-human guides (*rtags su mi ma yin pa rnams dang brda phrad cing*), communication with unseen beings (*gtam zer ba dag 'ong*)—describes tantric accomplishment (*dngos grub*) progression. The fourth effect—through cutting speech-expression (*ngag gi brjod pa bkag pa*), mind is trained (*yid 'byongs*), with signs: previously unseen non-human forms appear (*sngon du mi ma yin gyi gzugs mthong ba*), then clairvoyance (*mngon par shes pa*) dawns piece by piece (*dum bu pa 'char ro*)—completes the threefold training trajectory. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of accomplishment-seeking: treating these "signs" and "accomplishments" as goals rather than recognition-confirmations. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all these "attainments" are self-liberation-display (*rang grol) of awareness, not new acquisitions.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: MEDITATIVE-ABSORPTION MISUNDERSTANDING]

<The crucial instruction on cutting body-mind connection (*lus sems kyi 'brel gcod pa*) through speech-gnad operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The mind-gnad instruction: gaze into the expanse of space (*nam mkha'i mthongs su mig lta ba*) without thinking anything (*rtog pa ci yang ma bsam*). This is not spatial gazing but recognition of awareness's own expanse (*dbyings*). The *Thal 'Gyur* citation—"Mind (*sems*) is accomplished (*'grub*) through placing (*gtad pa*) in expanse (*dbyings la*)"—provides definitive pointing: mind's accomplishment is not attainment of new state but recognition of its nature as expanse. The phrase "placing" (*gtad pa*) does not mean fixing or forcing but allowing recognition to settle naturally. The definitive integration: when body and speech are controlled (*gtso bo lus ngag gnyis gcun pas*), mind naturally follows (*sems zhor la 'chun nas*), space-rigpa dawns (*dbyings rig 'char zhing*), and element-bonds sever (*khams su gyi 'ching ba gcod de*). This establishes that all training (body, speech, mind) is ultimately preparation for recognition: when gross activity (body) and verbal activity (speech) settle, mind naturally reveals itself as space-rigpa awareness (*dbyings rig*). The phrase "space-rigpa" (*dbyings rig*) is crucial: it indicates that awareness (*rig pa*) and its display as expanse (*dbyings*) are inseparable. Risk of meditative-absorption misunderstanding: treating "placing mind in expanse" as meditative absorption state rather than direct recognition of awareness's nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "element-bonds severing" (*khams su gyi 'ching ba gcod*) refers to recognizing that elements were never truly binding; the severing is recognition of self-liberation, not elimination of something real. The citation from *Sa bon gyi rgyud* continues the definitive pointing.>
