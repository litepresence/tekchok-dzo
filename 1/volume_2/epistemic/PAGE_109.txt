[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: DETERMINISM]

<The opening statement on Samantabhadra and capacity equality (*thog ma'i kun tu bzang po dang skal ba mnyam*) establishes definitive Dzogchen ground: the primordial state (*thog ma*) and individual capacity (*skal ba*) are already equal, not gradually achieved. The instruction that training to capacity (*goms pa tshad du phyin*) causes liberation in light (*rdos bcas 'od du 'grol ba*) operates as *upāya* for practitioners who benefit from path-structure, but the definitive view recognizes that liberation is the recognition of what was never bound. The threefold description—wandering through self-arising fields (*rang bzhin sprul pa'i zhing bgrod*), the six wanderings (*'gro drug*) with confusion (*'khrul pa*) cutting the basis—these are pedagogical descriptions of how samsara manifests from recognition-failure, not ontological states. Risk of determinism: interpreting "capacity equality" as all beings having equal path-progress rather than recognition-availability.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: TEMPORALITY]

<The citation from *rang byung bstan pa* and subsequent analysis operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The rhetorical question—who sees (*su yis mthong ba'i mi*) in this manner—and the statement that Samantabhadra and capacity are equal (*thog ma'i kun tu bzang po dang skal ba nyid ni mnyam pa'o*)—establish that recognition is available to all regardless of apparent difference. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on vessel-hook-continuum's self-arising (*lu gu rgyud kyi rang bzhin ni*) and concepts all purified (*rnam par rtog pa kun dag pas*) non-delusion basis (*ma 'khrul gzhi*) spontaneously expanding (*yi sangs rgyas*)—this describes the nature of ground: appearance arises from itself, concepts are already pure, and the basis of non-delusion spontaneously expands. The "basis" (*gzhi*) here is not a substrate but recognition's own nature. Risk of temporality: interpreting "spontaneously expanding" as gradual process rather than timeless quality of ground.>

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE-LIGHT DISPLAY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VISUALIZATION-INTERPRETATION]

<The five-light appearance mode teaching (*'od lnga'i rang gdangs lang ling du snang ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side* with *instructional provisionality* for recognition preparation. The description: outer five lights' self-resonance appearing in space, thigle and particles (*thig le phra mo*) connecting to vessel-hook-continuum, the analogy of stars not wandering outward (*thog mar dkar zing skar ma 'phro ba lta bu*), thigle containing five colors (*thig le kha dog lnga ldan*)—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. The statement "therefore one sees thigle" (*de nas thig le mthong ba yin no*) indicates that when recognition recognizes itself, the subtle display naturally becomes apparent, not through cultivation. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "five lights" and "thigle" as visual phenomena to search for rather than self-manifesting qualities of awareness.>

[4841-4844]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – LIGHT-ESSENCE NON-DUALITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<The definitive analysis on looking at outer clear light (*phyi'i 'od gsal la bltas pas*) operates from *rigpa-side*. When one looks at outer clear light, inner concepts cease (*nang rnam rtog bral te*), difference-free equal liberation (*ris med mnyam par grol ba*)—this establishes that recognition of one aspect (outer light) reveals the whole nature (inner concepts ceased). The citation from *rang byung*: essence's self-resonance (*ka dag gi rig gdangs*) and spontaneous presence's light-resonance (*lhun grub kyi 'od gdangs gnyis*), outer and inner (*phyi nang*) joined (*zung du 'brel bas*), appearance-emptiness non-separated (*dbyings rig 'du 'bral med pa*), the intention (*dgongs pa*)—this is the definitive view: the two resonances (essence and spontaneous presence) are not separate; outer and inner are joined; appearance and emptiness are non-separated. Risk of substantialism: treating "light-resonance" as some subtle substance rather than descriptive metaphor for awareness's luminous quality.>

[4845-4853]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR APPEARANCES]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SEQUENTIALISM]

<The four-appearance mode teaching (*snang ba bzhi 'char ba'i rim pa la gnyis te*) operates as *instructional provisionality* providing structural recognition framework. The two-part division: (1) meaning condensed (*ngo bo mdor bstan pa*) and (2) spontaneously expanded (*rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa*). First part: in the four appearances' time (*snang ba bzhi ka'i dus su*), body abides in posture (*lus bzhugs stangs la gnas pa*), eyes gaze in style (*mig gzigs stangs la lta ba*), wind-awareness self-resting equal three points (*rlung rig ngang gis dal ba gsum gnad mthun la*)—this describes the mode of recognition, not a technique. The key point: especially (*khyad par*) appearance and po (*snang ba dang po gnyis su sbyangs pas*), through that (*de'i nas*), not relying on outer effort (*phyi ma gnyis su rtsol ba la ma ltos par*) self-resting causes liberation (*ngang gis 'byongs nas*), therefore it is liberation in clear light (*'od gsal du grol ba yin pas*), so appearance-awareness non-dual (*dbyings rig gnyis su med pa*). Risk of sequentialism: treating "four appearances" as chronological stages rather than simultaneous recognition-descriptions.>

[4854-4857]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – AWARENESS-GNAD]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ESSENTIALISM]

<The awareness-gnad (*rig pa'i gnad*) instruction operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The point (*gnad*) that awareness should not separate from vajra and vessel-hook-continuum (*rig pa rdo rje lu gu rgyud dang mi 'bral bar bya ba*)—this is the definitive instruction on non-separation: awareness is the nature (*rdo rje* is descriptive metaphor) and vessel-hook-continuum is the display; they are not two. The explanation: awareness (*rig pa*) is essence-nature itself (*ngo bo rang bzhin*), compassion-Three (*thugs rje gsum*) undivided (*dbyer mi phyed pa*), abiding in basis (*gzhi gnas*), and its light-resonance appearance (*de'i gdangs 'od*)—from root and branch (*rtsa dngas pa'i snang ba*) like golden thread connecting to golden knot (*gser gyi skud pa lta bu breng chags la 'khyog mtshams*), connect with thigle (*thig les sbrel ba*). The final statement: Vajra (*rdo rje*) from the side of immovable abiding, all sentient beings (*sangs rgyas sems can kun la*) equal good and bad nature (*ngo bo bzang ngan med par mnyam*) and unchanging (*mi 'gyur ba*)—establishes that the ground is impartial recognition, not a state achieved. Risk of essentialism: treating "vajra" as some essential substance rather than awareness's indestructible quality.>
