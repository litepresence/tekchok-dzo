[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Masterful analysis:
Experience-increase etc. appearances not-arisen exhausted also exists—this called "supreme intelligence instantaneous." That also: previously purified karma-potent, guru respect greater-than-others merely, exhaustion manner existence merely. The individual nature extensive explanation: essence, definitive terminology, nature, dharmatā, ground-portion—five. Dharmatā exhaustion's essence: outer five lights' appearance body with exhausted, inner with-obstacles conception-gatherings with exhausted, experience-appearance's object exhausted, primordial purity appearance sky like state rigpa abiding. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Dharmatā exhaustion appearance: experience's appearance emptied, body exhausted faculties' object also exhausted, conception-gatherings delusion liberated from, expressed-basis's word free from." Definitive terminology: *chos* means body-speech-mind's gathering's phenomena afflictions with; *nyid* means purifying path's appearance clear-light meditation aspect with; *zad pa* means emptied—mind's meditation object-appearance with self-reversed nonexistent; *mi dmigs pa* called; from that: "thus dharmatā definitive terminology, phenomena knowing gathered gathered..." [continues]. The Dzogchen view: "instantaneous" (*cig car*) does not mean "quick" but recognition without sequential stages; "exhaustion" is not process but the always-already nature of phenomena.>
