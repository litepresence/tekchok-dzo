[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage presents the "three non-movements" (mi 'gul ba gsum) of mind and the "three stays" (sdod pa gsum) of body, wind, and vision as definitive expressions of the natural state. The epistemic stance shifts from prescriptive instruction to declarative certainty: these are not practices to be cultivated but recognitions of what is already the case. Longchenpa describes how remaining without action (bya ba las 'das pa), without birth (mi skye ba'i tshad), and without reversal (mi ldog pa) naturally occur when recognition is stable. The passage operates from the rigpa-side: the four measures (tshad bzhi) of body, speech, and mind arriving at their destination are presented as spontaneous results, not achievements. The description of delusion's wheel ceasing and karma's maturation ending reflects the view beyond cause and effect.>
