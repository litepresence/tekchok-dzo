[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMBHOGAKAYA POSTURE]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: FORMALISM]

<Sambhogakaya posture seven: body cross-legged vajra, channels not pressured, winds balanced, awareness clear not dull, appearances luminous, bliss warmth naturally arising, non-conceptual samadhi. The seven points support recognition but are not recognition itself. Risk of formalism: treating the form as sufficient without the view of recognition.>
