[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SELF-LIBERATED VIEW]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PASSIVE RESIGNATION]

<Dharmakaya's view spontaneously self-liberated! Sambhogakaya's meditation spontaneously self-liberated! Emanation's conduct spontaneously self-liberated! Three kayas' result spontaneously self-accomplished! Spontaneously presence's meaning definite! From Self-Arisen: "Primordially pure spontaneous presence!" From Jewel Garland: "Great bliss dharmadhatu wheel, wisdom ornament great!" The spontaneous liberation is recognition, not passivity. Risk of passive resignation: interpreting "spontaneous" as excuse for non-effort rather than natural perfection.>
