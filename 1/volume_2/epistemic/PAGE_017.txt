[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ENUMERATION FATIGUE]

Longchenpa presents a comprehensive taxonomy of "fives" (*lnga*) that structure the Dzogchen path from ground to fruit. The epistemic strategy is enumerative completeness—establishing that all aspects of the path are already spontaneously perfect (*ye rdzogs, ye grub, ye shar, ye gdangs*).

**The Fivefold Structure:**
- **Five Mothers** (*ma lnga*): Buddha Eyes, Mamaki, Pandara, Samaya Tara—the female buddhas representing the five wisdoms
- **Five Groups** (*tshom bu lnga*): Akshobhya etc., each surrounded by five, adorned with five-colored light walls
- **Five Primordial Completions** (*ye lnga*): Paths complete, bodies complete, awareness self-dawned, lights self-resonant, obscurations self-pure
- **Five Knowledges** (*shes lnga*): Knowing the five bodies, five wisdoms, five lights, self-vision, and great extreme-free non-duality
- **Five Realizations** (*rtogs pa lnga*): Realizing object as dharmadhatu, beings as bodies, vision as light, dawn-liberation as limitless, discriminating awareness as awareness itself

[RISK: ENUMERATION FATIGUE] The extensive listing must not be read as a checklist to complete. The prefix *ye-* (primordial/self-) on each completion indicates this is recognition, not achievement.

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY] "Thus in groups of five appearing" (*de ltar lnga tshan du snang ba*)—the epistemic closure emphasizes that these are aspects of spontaneous presence, not constructed categories.
