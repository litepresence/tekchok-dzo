[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKĀYA AS UNMODIFIABLE GROUND]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALIZATION]

Longchenpa establishes the dharmakāya as "not possible to alter, transform, grasp, or designate" (*bcos shing bsgyur dang ngos gzung zhing brdar gdags mi btub pa*). The simile "like earth-ground and sky" (*sa gzhi dang nam mkha' lta bu*) is precise: earth as stable support, sky as unobstructed space—neither can be modified by external force. The five lights' subtle clarity appears like sparks behind the five sense-faculties. Expansive heart-essence dharmakāya—this very awareness abiding is what holds the basis of all. Epistemic stance: dharmakāya is not an entity that could be modified; modification presupposes duality (modifier/modified) that ground-nonduality precludes. Risk: readers may substantialize dharmakāya as a "thing" that paradoxically "cannot be changed" rather than recognizing that change/unchange are dualistic categories inapplicable to ground.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DWELLING PLACE AS NON-LOCALITY]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SPATIALIZATION]

The "dwelling palace" (*bzhugs pa'i pho brang*) is explained through citation: dharmadhātu, empty-pervasive like space. When dharmakāya dwells in the jewel cleft, this is called "dharmatā pure primordial resonance" (*chos nyid dag pa'i ye gdangs*). Awareness dwells in the light-mansion, light-appearance. This is called "original universal ground awareness-expanse" (*thog ma'i spyi gzhi rig pa'i dbyings*). Epistemic precision: "palace," "cleft," "mansion" are not spatial locations but metaphors for dimensionless dimension. "Dwells" (*bzhugs*) indicates abiding without location, not occupation of coordinates. Risk: readers may visualize this as actual luminous chambers in the body or cosmos, missing that "light-mansion" refers to the self-radiance of awareness itself.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FIRES AS FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: ELEMENTAL REIFICATION]

The five fires (*me lnga*) emerge from spontaneous presence (*rang shar*): pervasive fire of outer-inner-all, clarifying fire of outer-inner-all, equalizing fire of outer-inner-all, discriminating fire of outer-inner activity, and accomplishing fire of outer-inner activity. Epistemic mapping: these correspond to the five wisdoms' active aspect—pervasive like dharmadhātu-wisdom, clarifying like mirror-wisdom, equalizing like equality-wisdom, discriminating like discriminating-wisdom, accomplishing like all-accomplishing-wisdom. "Fire" (*me*) indicates transformative power, not combustion. Risk: practitioners may attempt to "work with" these fires as elemental forces, missing that they are wisdom-function appearing as fire-metaphor. The "outer-inner" (*phyi nang*) framing prevents localization—fire is neither external element nor internal heat, but wisdom-heat pervading all.
