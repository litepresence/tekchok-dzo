[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DISSOLUTION ANALOGIES]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALISM]

<That time samsara itself first-last cut called. Thus sky mixed or, outer appearance self-light's rays dharmadhatu dissolved, sun setting rays self gathered; water into water dissolved; butter into butter dissolved likewise. From blazing relic: then essence kadag, from sun rays gather like, self-appearance emanation with, self-essence self-dissolved, difference not division not becomes. As water into water dissolves. The dissolution analogies point to non-dual recognition, not literal merging of substances. Risk of substantialism: treating dissolution as mixing of entities rather than recognition of non-duality.>
