[RISK: METAPHORIC REIFICATION]

The presentation of dharmakaya characteristics employs similes (sun, ocean, lotus, mountain, sky, lion) to indicate qualities beyond verbal expression. Risk of literalizing these as metaphysical categories rather than experiential descriptors of recognition. The self-arisen nature (rang shar) establishes that these qualities are not cultivated but recognized as already present. The presentation functions declaratively, stating what is the case regarding the nature of enlightened mind.

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

The dharmakaya nature is presented as inseparable from appearance (snang ba), where appearance itself is empty luminosity (stong gsal). The marks (rtags) and characteristics (mtshan nyid) are not external attributes but dimensions of self-recognizing awareness. The six aspects—nature, definition, manifestation, place, and additional dimensions—function as complete phenomenological description of what awareness is, not properties to be acquired.

[RISK: MEDITATION AS DOING]

The presentation of meditation (sgom pa) and view (lta ba) establishes non-duality: meditation is view itself, not a practice that generates view. The statement that view is "without looking yet seeing" (bltar med bltas zin) points to non-conceptual direct perception. The activity (spyod pa) of dharmakaya is spontaneous (lhun grub), not effortful cultivation.
