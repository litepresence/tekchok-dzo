<Masterful analysis:
Classical Abhidharmic framework establishing conventional cosmology as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). The Wylie terminology (*phyi nang*, *'byung ba*, *rten brten*) functions as pedagogical placeholders that will undergo Dzogchen transformation. The crucial turn occurs in recognizing that elemental characteristics are not inherent properties but recognition-marks (*rtags*) of wisdom-display.>
