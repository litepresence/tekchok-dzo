[DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKĀYA AS SELF-ABIDING GREATNESS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: SUBSTANTIALIZATION]

Longchenpa defines dharmakāya as "nature spontaneous presence luminosity body self-abiding greatness" (*rang bzhin lhun grub 'od gsal gyi sku rang gnas chen po*). Citation establishes dharmakāya's definitive term (*nges tshig*): unchanging, empty, clear, all deeds complete. Epistemic precision: The compound strings essence (*rang bzhin*), nature (*lhun grub*), and compassion (*'od gsal*) into dharmakāya's definition. "Self-abiding" (*rang gnas*) prevents any movement toward or away—dharmakāya neither comes from elsewhere nor goes elsewhere. It is not "in" the practitioner to be discovered. Risk: Substantialization—reading "unchanging empty clear" as attributes of a metaphysical entity rather than the non-attribute of ground.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – OWN-BODY AS BEYOND ELABORATION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

Own-body (*rang lus*) is free from all elaboration extremes—nothing established anywhere. Citation: "No outer no inner no expanse—this is dharmakāya's own-body." Epistemic precision: The negation pattern "no X no Y no Z" operates at apophatic extreme. This is not merely Madhyamaka's absence of svabhāva but Dzogchen's positive assertion of ground-beyond-negation. Risk: View collapse—reading this as standard Madhyamaka emptiness, missing that Dzogchen's "no expanse" (*dbyings su med*) refers to freedom even from dharmadhātu as reified category.

[763-775]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIMILES AS PEDAGOGICAL INDICATION]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: SIMILE REIFICATION]

Similes: awareness-luminosity like sun, depth like ocean, unstained by faults like lotus, unchanging like mountain, vast without center-edge like space, possessing all-vanquishing confidence and primordial lion. Citation: "Sun ocean lotus mountain space lion—these are dharmakāya's similes." Epistemic function: Similes indicate without defining. Sun indicates luminous self-illumination; ocean indicates unfathomable depth; lotus indicates purity-within-samsara; mountain indicates unmoving stability; space indicates unobstructed pervasion; lion indicates fearless confidence. Risk: Simile reification—treating sun/ocean/lotus as literally present in dharmakāya rather than as pedagogical pointing devices.
