[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<The passage presents the sixteen stages (sa bcu drug) as spontaneously completed through direct recognition of true reality (bden pa mthong ba). The epistemic stance is rigpa-side definitive—Longchenpa maps the traditional bodhisattva stages onto moments of recognition: joy at first seeing reality, stainlessness through recognizing self-appearance, light-illumination through familiarization, and so forth. However, the crucial distinction is that these are not stages to be traversed but recognition's natural display. The citation from Rig pa rang shar explicitly negates stages existing elsewhere (sa zhes bya ba gud na yod pa ma yin): "Grounds and paths do not exist elsewhere." The risk lies in collapsing this back into gradualist frameworks or mistaking the mapping for an ontological claim about progressive development. The passage operates from the definitive view where all paths are complete in a single recognition.>
