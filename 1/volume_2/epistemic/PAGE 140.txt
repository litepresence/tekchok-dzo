[DZOGCHEN VIEW – TEN GROUNDS SIMULTANEOUS]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: STAGE PROGRESSION]

<From Self-Arisen: "Ground called elsewhere existing not! Truth-seeing person one to grounds all complete existing!" Introduction-shown person that, first truth-seeing's time joy arisen is first ground Great Joy! That self-vision awareness-ground second ground Stainless obtained! Then habituation third ground Light-Doing! Habituated light's vision seeing fourth ground Light-Radiating! Fifth Difficult-to-Overcome, sixth Manifest, seventh Far-Going, eighth Immovable, ninth Perfect Intellect, tenth Cloud-Dharma! All ten grounds are complete in one moment of truth-seeing. Risk of stage progression: reading these as sequential rather than simultaneous.>
