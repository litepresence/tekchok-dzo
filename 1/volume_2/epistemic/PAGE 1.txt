[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
[STRUCTURAL TRANSITION]

<Volume 2 opening marks transition from Volume 1's ground-establishment to dependent arising analysis. The structural division into "common distinctions" and "particular natures" operates from pedagogical sems-based entry before ascending to rigpa-view.>

[9-21]
[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<Direct assertion that outer and inner elements are non-dual appearances of awareness. The five pure elements are defined as luminous wisdom with five colors, while the five impure elements are their confused manifestation—not separate substances but same nature viewed differently.>

[RISK: VIEW COLLAPSE]

<Outer elements presented as "support" and inner elements as "supported" initially appears dualistic, but functions as scaffolding for non-dual view. Risk: readers may fixate on container/contained duality and miss that both are equally display of awareness-nature.>

[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

<Quotation from *Rang Shar* operates from definitive view that all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arise from the five elements' nature. The assertion that "without five elements, not even the name Buddha or sentient being exists" is not nihilistic denial but pointing to ground-as-display. Upāya function: deconstructing reified notions of Buddhas and beings as separate entities.>

[STRUCTURAL TRANSITION]

<Transition marker to detailed analysis of outer and inner arising. Structural division indicates pedagogical progression from overview to particular examination.>
