[RISK: PRACTICE MISREAD AS ONTOLOGY]

<The passage presents the "three main points" (gnad gsum) of practice: gate, field, and wind-awareness. While the language appears technical and prescriptive, the epistemic frame is instructional upāya—methods for guiding the practitioner toward recognition. The analogies (weapon hitting vital point, threshold, escort, bandit) operate at the conventional cognitive level to explain how these three points "capture" awareness. The risk lies in reifying these three points as ontologically existent structures rather than pedagogical pointers. Longchenpa speaks from the sems-side here, using conceptual frameworks familiar to practitioners of channels and winds, but these are meant to collapse into direct recognition, not to be grasped as definitive descriptions of reality.>
