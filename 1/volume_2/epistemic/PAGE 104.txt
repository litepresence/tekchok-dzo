<The citations establishing the threefold training structure operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement—"Training body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag gsum gcun pa*), becoming accustomed to dharmata's appearance (*chos kyi dbyings kyi snang ba la*), thus one becomes accustomed (*'di yis goms par 'gyur ba yin*)"—indicates that through systematic training, one habituates to recognizing awareness's own display. The second citation—"Knowing the gnad of body, speech, and mind (*lus dang ngag dang yid kyi gnad shes shing*) and applying it (*bstun pas*), one liberates from cyclic existence (*'khor las grol*)"—establishes that knowledge (*shes pa*) must be coupled with application (*bstun pa*) for liberation. These citations from tantric sources operate as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from structured path methodology. The phrase "dharmata's appearance" (*chos kyi dbyings kyi snang ba*) indicates that dharmata is not a hidden essence but the very appearance of experience when recognized. Risk of gradual path essentializing: treating the threefold training as necessary stages rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind are not truly separate entities but display-modes of single awareness; the training points to recognizing what has always been present, not attaining something new.>

<The definitive statement about the second purpose (*don gnyis pa*)—placing on one's own threshold (*rang thog tu dbab pa*) the three gnads (*gnad gsum la brten nas*) for direct recognition (*mngon sum*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The threefold structure of direct recognition: (1) Binding the three gnads in vajra constraint (*gnad gsum rdo rje'i chings su bsdams pa*); (2) Giving the self-face of direct recognition (*mngon sum rig pa'i rang ngo sprad pa*); (3) Showing the mode of appearance from that (*de las snang ba'i 'char tshul bstan pa*). This establishes that direct recognition requires precise preparation: the "vajra constraint" (*rdo rje'i chings*) refers to the unbreakable nature of the three gnads when properly understood; "self-face" (*rang ngo*) refers to recognition of awareness's own face without mediation; "mode of appearance" (*'char tshul*) refers to how awareness-display naturally manifests from recognition. The subdivision of the first binding into two aspects: showing the general constraint of the three gnads (*gnad gsum spyi'i chings bstan pa*) and placing on one's own individual gnad (*bye brag rang gi gnad thog tu dbab pa*)—indicates that understanding the general principle must be followed by personal application. Risk of methodology reification: treating "vajra constraint" as fixed method rather than metaphorical description of recognition's unshakeable nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "direct recognition" (*mngon sum*) refers to recognizing awareness's self-knowledge, not external perception of something.>

<The detailed explanation of the three gnads—door (*sgo*), object (*yul*), and wind-rig (*rlung rig*)—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation establishes: "The three gnads should not be separated from secret instruction" (*gnad gsum man ngag 'bral mi bya*)—they are door, object, and wind-rig gnads. The metaphorical elaboration: door-gnad is like a guard (*so pa*), object-gnad is like a guest (*'gron po*), wind-rig gnad is like a butcher (*jag pa*). The functional description: door-gnad makes seeing happen (*sgo'i gnad kyis mthong bar byed*), object-gnad makes unchanging (*yul gyi gnad kyis mi 'gyur bar byed*), wind-rig gnad places signs onto measure (*rlung rig gi gnad kyis rtags tshad la 'bebs pa*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). The analogy with lethal points (*dper na gnad la zin pa'i mtshon dang 'dra ste*): just as striking a vital point (*lus kyi rtsa rgyus sam don snying la sogs pa'i gnad la phog na*) makes one feel nothing regardless of activity (*ci byas kyang mi 'tshor bar 'chi ba dang 'dra bar*), so the three gnads transform one into dharmata—not gradually but instantly (*chos nyid la 'gyur ba'i sa med*). The necessity of all three: without object-gnad, no basis for support (*yul med na rten sa'i gzhi med*); without door-gnad, losing path of going (*sgo med na 'gro ba'i lam stor*); without wind-rig gnad, awareness does not resolve inward (*rlung rig gi gnad med na shes rig nang du mi chod pa*). Therefore these three are definite (*gnad gsum du nges la*): not more (*de las mang na*)—infinite would lose the gnad (*mtha' yas pas gnad stor la*); not fewer (*nyung na*)—purpose would not be accomplished (*don mi 'grub pa*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "door," "object," and "wind-rig" as anatomical structures rather than recognition-coordinates. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these three gnads are not entities but modes of recognition: door refers to how awareness perceives, object refers to what awareness perceives, wind-rig refers to the energetic dimension of awareness.>

[RISK: SEQUENTIALIZATION]

<The second subdivision—placing on one's own individual gnad (*bye brag rang gi gnad thog tu dbab pa*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side* as direct introduction. This subdivision contains two aspects: determining the general order of the three gnads (*gnad gsum spyi'i rim pa nges pa*) and placing on each individual gnad (*so so'i gnad la thog tu dbab pa*). The phrase "general order" (*spyi'i rim pa*) indicates the sequential recognition process, but the Dzogchen view recognizes that in actual recognition, all three gnads operate simultaneously, not sequentially. The phrase "determining" (*nges pa*) means recognizing definitively that these three are necessary and sufficient, not tentatively considering them. The phrase "placing on each individual gnad" (*so so'i gnad la thog tu dbab pa*) refers to direct application of each gnad in one's own experience: not theoretical understanding but experiential recognition. The opening of this section—"body, speech, and mind unmoving (*lus ngag sems gsum mi 'gul zhing*) and controlling door, object, and wind-rig (*sgo dang yul dang rlung rig gcun pa*)"—establishes the state for applying the gnads: when gross activity of body, speech, and mind settles, the subtle gnads become accessible. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*): the recognition that awareness is not achieved through controlling the gnads but through recognizing that the gnads are awareness's own display. Risk of sequentialization: treating the "general order" as temporal sequence rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind "unmoving" (*mi 'gul*) does not mean physical immobilization but resting in awareness without grasping at activity.>
