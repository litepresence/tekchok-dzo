<The passage presents the introduction to bardo instructions drawn from the Nyi kha sbyor (Sun Union) tantra, using narrative address ("Listen, conqueror!" / kye ma thub pa khyod nyon cig). The epistemic stance is sūtric provisional—Longchenpa establishes the framework for bardo practice through scriptural citation, narrative structure, and the eight topics of the death-time bardo instructions. The passage operates at the conventional pedagogical level, setting up the necessity for practice based on the certainty of death and the difficulty of obtaining the precious human birth. The citations from Sun Union establish the results of recognizing the four lamps (space, thigle, wisdom, water) as conventional attainments within the bardo framework. Readers risk collapsing this provisional sūtric/tantric presentation into definitive Dzogchen view, failing to recognize that these are skilful means for those who have not recognized the nature. The passage functions as the gateway to bardo teachings, not as the definitive view itself.>
