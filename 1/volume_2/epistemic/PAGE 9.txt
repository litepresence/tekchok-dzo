[DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE WINDS AS WISDOM-FUNCTION]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]
[RISK: PHYSIOLOGICAL REDUCTION]

Longchenpa presents five winds (*rlung*) from spontaneous presence (*rang shar*): life-holding wind (*srog 'dzin*), vitality-luminosity-producing wind (*bkra gzi mdangs skyed*), fire-equalizing wind (*me mnyam*), all-pervasive wind (*kun khyab*), and compassionless karma wind (*snying rje med bsKal pa las kyi rlung*). These dwell at crown, navel, heart, pervading body, and between heart-heart envelope. Functions: sustaining life, producing radiance, digesting food, moving/dwelling, and transference.

Epistemic precision: The "locations" are not anatomical but wisdom-placeholders. "Crown" refers to dharmakaya expanse, "navel" to sambhogakaya enjoyment, "heart" to nirmanakaya emanation. The karma wind's "compassionless" (*snying rje med*) designation is crucial—it's the wind of deluded action, yet still wisdom-display when recognized. Risk: Physiological reduction—mapping these to respiratory or cardiovascular functions, missing that *rlung* here is dynamic awareness, not biological process.

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND SUBDIVISION AS EXHAUSTIVE MAPPING]
[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]
[RISK: OVER-SYSTEMATIZATION]

Each of five winds subdivides into five, creating twenty-five. First, life-holding wind's five from spontaneous presence... Epistemic function: This subdivision serves pedagogical completeness, preventing partial understanding. However, the text deliberately pauses (*...*) suggesting the pattern continues without needing exhaustive enumeration. Risk: Over-systematization—treating the twenty-five winds as a complete ontology rather than a provisional scaffold for recognition.
