[INSTRUCTIONAL PROVISIONALITY]

Detailed subtle body anatomy (five principal winds: life-holding, color-producing, fire-equal, all-pervading, karma) operates within tantric transformative framework. The assignment of winds to body locations (heart, chest, navel) and functions (life maintenance, digestion, movement) serves as practice map, not ontological assertion. View is explicitly instrumental—supporting completion stage meditation rather than describing ultimate nature.

[UPĀYA STATEMENT]

Branch division (25 winds from 5 roots) presents increasingly subtle classification schema. The etymological explanations ("move-making wind" because it moves on true ground) function as practice mnemonics. This is tantric upāya—conceptual elaboration serving meditative application. No claim to ultimate truth-status of the 25-fold system.
