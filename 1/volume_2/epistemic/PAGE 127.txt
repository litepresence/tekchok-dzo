[DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
[DECLARATIVE FINALITY]

<The passage presents the exhaustion of dharmas (chos zad pa'i 'bras bu) and the entry into primordially pure dharmakāya. The epistemic stance is definitive—Longchenpa cites Thalgyur extensively to establish that cessation is not something achieved but recognized as primordially present. The description of elements ceasing, dust ceasing, aggregates becoming subtle, and all becoming wisdom sambhogakāya operates within the framework of spontaneous completion (lhun grub), not gradual transformation. The "white silk curtain" (dar dkar gyi yol ba) analogy indicates the subtle obscuration of knowables (shes bya'i sgrib pa) that remains like a thin veil even at advanced stages. The passage shifts between descriptive language (what happens) and negational language (what does not happen), reflecting the Dzogchen view beyond being and non-being. This operates at the rigpa-side level where ground, path, and fruition are unified.>
