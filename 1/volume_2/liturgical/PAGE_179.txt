[7583] Nature of great perfection's extreme:
[7584] Dharmas settled in their own place,
[7585] Appearance-awareness dharmata unity—
[7586] Ye-grol reaches cog-bzhag itself.
[7587] Dgongs-pa beyond thought,
[7588] Marked settled in self-place purified,
[7589] Empty and entity extremes liberated,
[7590] Movement-exhausted, concept not existing,
[7591] Thought-exhausted, mind beyond.
[7592] Thus.
[7593] From the previous:
[7594] */ Elements five themselves primordially pure,
[7595] */ Appearance as luminosity itself liberated.
[7596] */ Sense-faculties five themselves cer-settled,
[7597] */ Grasping's objects five self-place liberated.
[7598] Thus.
[7599] Third: From Thal-'gyur:
[7600] Rang-mind liberation called—
[7601] */ From one to one gone not.
[7602] */ Mind not-existing who liberates,
[7603] */ Basis perfected, going-coming not.
[7604] */ Examined not-found, cause-reason not,
[7605] */ Basis-root not-existing, empty-luminosity abides.
[7606] */ That mind self-luminous abiding,
[7607] */ Liberated by essence, direction-partition not.
[7608] */ Liberated by time, reference-basis not.
[7609] */ Liberated effort-less, effort not.
[7610] */ Liberated by confidence, effort-striving not.
[7611] */ To that, liberation by confidence explained.
[7612] */ Ye-from liberated, returning-basis not.
[7613] */ Self-liberated, antidote not.
[7614] */ Cer-loosened at seeing-place also,
[7615] */ Completely liberated, effort-less.
[7616] Thus.
[7617] That also: gates-three ye-from liberated, from-beginning effort by liberation not-needed. Body's mudra-turning etc. whatsoever not-needed—elements self-essence liberated, six-realms back not-returning. Speech's effort, essence-recitation etc. do not-needed—expression clear-pure liberated, speaking all sound-meaning's essence liberated. Mind's effort, meditation cultivation etc. do not-needed—what thought, dgongs-pa's essence liberated. Other from arising not, self-liberated, antidote existing not-possible.
[7618] Thus self-liberation's essence: antidote not-existing.
[7619] To liberation called...
