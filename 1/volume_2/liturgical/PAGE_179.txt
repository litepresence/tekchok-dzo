Nature of great perfection's extreme:
Dharmas settled in their own place,
Appearance-awareness dharmata unity—
Ye-grol reaches cog-bzhag itself.

Dgongs-pa beyond thought,
Marked settled in self-place purified,
Empty and entity extremes liberated,
Movement-exhausted, concept not existing,
Thought-exhausted, mind beyond.

Thus.

From the previous:
*/ Elements five themselves primordially pure,
*/ Appearance as luminosity itself liberated.
*/ Sense-faculties five themselves cer-settled,
*/ Grasping's objects five self-place liberated.

Thus.

Third: From Thal-'gyur:

Rang-mind liberation called—
*/ From one to one gone not.
*/ Mind not-existing who liberates,
*/ Basis perfected, going-coming not.
*/ Examined not-found, cause-reason not,
*/ Basis-root not-existing, empty-luminosity abides.
*/ That mind self-luminous abiding,
*/ Liberated by essence, direction-partition not.
*/ Liberated by time, reference-basis not.
*/ Liberated effort-less, effort not.
*/ Liberated by confidence, effort-striving not.
*/ To that, liberation by confidence explained.
*/ Ye-from liberated, returning-basis not.
*/ Self-liberated, antidote not.
*/ Cer-loosened at seeing-place also,
*/ Completely liberated, effort-less.

Thus.

That also: gates-three ye-from liberated, from-beginning effort by liberation not-needed. Body's mudra-turning etc. whatsoever not-needed—elements self-essence liberated, six-realms back not-returning. Speech's effort, essence-recitation etc. do not-needed—expression clear-pure liberated, speaking all sound-meaning's essence liberated. Mind's effort, meditation cultivation etc. do not-needed—what thought, dgongs-pa's essence liberated. Other from arising not, self-liberated, antidote existing not-possible.

Thus self-liberation's essence: antidote not-existing.

To liberation called...
