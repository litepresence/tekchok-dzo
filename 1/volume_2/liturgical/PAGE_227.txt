[9685] Also from World Sun Dharma-Lord Guru's mouth:
[9686] Should carefully give introductions in sequence.
[9687] Ha-le!
[9688] Ho-le!
[9689] Without portion of what exists.
[9690] Not introduction.
[9691] Not introduced, do not.
[9692] Do not declare non-Dharma action.
[9693] Do not follow for delusion.
[9694] Do not do bad non-Dharma actions taking guru etc.'s name.
[9695] Thus making instruction: need to make name and meaning together.
[9696] Respectfully place in mind thus all who have entered this Dharma in future times.

[9697] Second meaning: extensively demonstrating mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction has two aspects:
[9698] Mind's introduction of delusion reversing manner from root awareness,
[9699] And self-appear wisdom's introduction of awareness with self-appear.

[9700] First:
[9701] From Introduction Ornament:
[9702] E-ma-ho!
[9703] Manner of coming to mind by giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9704] Reach expanding bliss of empty by giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9705] Giving introduction of empty as awareness,
[9706] Awareness itself without space and wisdom two. Thus it is spoken.

[9707] In this, three:
[9708] Establishing inner mind by outer field's essential point,
[9709] Establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point,
[9710] Establishing supreme awareness itself by secret space's essential point.

[9711] First, demonstrating deluded baseless appearance field,
[9712] From two: demonstrating self-mind empty of appearance-holding.
[9713] First: these various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements of container-contents,
[9714] Except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing,
[9715] And inner mind's thing, both not established,
[9716] Should understand as like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance, nature of clear-appear without base-without empty miracle.
[9717] From Six Expanses:
[9718] All appearance is illusion,
[9719] Like dream and reflection.
