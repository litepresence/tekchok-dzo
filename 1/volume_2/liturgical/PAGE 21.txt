[1072] When seeing spontaneously accomplished intermediate state's eight gates completion,
[1073] Liberated by knowing self-face,
[1074] In impure samsara's gate,
[1075] Oneself, from Sambhogakaya father-mother union's secret space, radiating light rays, entering individually into each station's pure father-mother womb, appearing to be born—through Dharma teaching, showing liberation.
[1076] This is like dream emanations opening example,
[1077] Summarized merely as self-appearance.
[1078] When channels and elements nearly pure, in this life also six realms appear inside thigle;
[1079] These bound by three inner crucial points binding, reaching exhaustion ground, not depending on emanations distributing.
[1080] This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power.
[1081] Second, performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1082] To ground-abiders, Sambhogakaya;
[1083] To impure, supreme emanation-kaya;
[1084] To very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to individual stations, performing individual beings' benefit.
[1085] From that same nature:
[1086] Performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1087] Showing to each whatever tames them,
[1088] Appearing suitable to others—
[1089] That is like above.
[1090] Not deluded regarding others' benefit,
[1091] Able to transform into anything.
[1092] Appearing suitable to others,
[1093] Overwhelming beings.
[1094] Afflictions naturally non-existent,
[1095] Latencies appearing like body.
[1096] To time-arrived beings,
[1097] Showing great correct benefit.
[1098] To whatever beings are tamed,
[1099] Appearing suitable to that.
[1100] Thus it is said.
[1101] That emanation-kaya also performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges:
[1102] Teaching Dharma in each being's own language through all languages' individual correct knowledge;
[1103] Also knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought;
[1104] Also great vehicle
[1105] And small,
[1106] And various,
[1107] And secret mantra: generation and completion;
