[1072] When seeing the completion of the eight gates of spontaneously accomplished intermediate state,
[1073] Liberated by knowing one's own face,
[1074] In that gate of impure samsara,
[1075] Oneself, from the secret space of Sambhogakaya father-mother union, radiating light rays, entering individually into the pure womb of father-mother at each station, appearing to be born—through teaching Dharma, showing liberation.

[1076] This is like the example of opening emanations in a dream,
[1077] Summarized merely as self-appearance.

[1078] When the channels and elements are nearly pure, in this life also the six realms appear inside the thigle;
[1079] These are bound by the binding of the three inner crucial points, reaching the ground of exhaustion, not depending on distributing emanations.

[1080] This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power.

[1081] Second, the emanation-kaya of performing actions:
[1082] To those abiding on the grounds, Sambhogakaya;
[1083] To the impure, the supreme emanation-kaya;
[1084] To the very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to individual stations, performing benefit for individual beings.

[1085] From that itself:
[1086] The emanation-kaya of performing actions:
[1087] Showing to each whatever tames them,
[1088] Appearing suitable to others—
[1089] That is like the above.
[1090] Not deluded regarding others' benefit,
[1091] Able to transform into anything.
[1092] Appearing suitable to others,
[1093] Overwhelming beings.
[1094] Afflictions naturally not existent,
[1095] Latencies appearing like the body.
[1096] To beings arrived at the time,
[1097] Showing the great correct benefit.
[1098] To whatever beings are tamed,
[1099] Appearing suitable to that.

[1100] Thus it is spoken.

[1101] That emanation-kaya also performs benefit through the four individual correct knowledges:
[1102] Teaching Dharma in each being's own language through individual correct knowledge of all languages;
[1103] Also knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought;
[1104] Also great vehicle
[1105] And small,
[1106] And various,
[1107] And in secret mantra: generation and completion;
