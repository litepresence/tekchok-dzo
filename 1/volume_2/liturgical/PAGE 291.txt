Ocean water's vapor dissolving, divide this also by wise sequence. In earth's villages and cities, monk smoke self breaking, perish like that in nine days. On Meru mountain's peak, unchanging sun setting, that also dies in three days. Completely abandoning rites, examine in self-awareness essence-meaning. From inside Merus' hollow, dakini's sound breaking, thirteen self or in five. If from wish-fulfilling tree, death-lords' demon rising, not liberated by seven days; that does not become benefit—precious to habituate in emptiness—thus.

Limb nail's luster not existing, not liberated in nine months; birth-being's eye's vapor dissolving, like that in five months; death-lord Yama self rising, die in twenty-one days; in that benefit not exist by anything. Foot's ankle protruding outward, like that in one month; if examining other's body, time of birth-being struck by disease, tartar accumulating at tooth's root, that also dies in nine days; like that various in five days; like that also death. Limb repeatedly moving contracting, that in seven days; eye grain sticking looking, tro-ta in three days; eye's joints greatly disturbed, that in half month; cheek's channel breaking, like that in nineteen days; birth-being doing life formation, breath gasping upward also agitated, that also in six months; nose's ma-si-ka breaking, perish in seven days; eye's ba-ra-na breaking, that also perishes in five days; left cheek's flesh falling, that like perishes in one day; upper lower teeth closed becoming, not liberated by three days; black drop arising on tongue, that also perishes by two days; ear sticking to head, that night at midnight; chest's protruding-nose collapsing, not liberated by half month; sleep fall root not existing, that also in half month—thus.

Third, showing reversal method.
