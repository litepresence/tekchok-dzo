[751] [751] Naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding—
[752] [752] From that same nature:
[753] [753] Fearless, empty, and clear,
[754] [754] All actions complete—
[755] [755] This is dharmakaya's definition.
[756] [756] Thus it is said.
[757] [757] Self-body is this:
[758] [758] Freed from all elaboration extremes, without anywhere accomplishment—
[759] [759] From Self-Arisen:
[760] [760] Without outer, without inner, without within expanse—
[761] [761] This is dharmakaya's self-body.
[762] [762] Thus it is said.
[763] [763] Metaphor is this:
[764] [764] Like sun through clear-light awareness;
[765] [765] Like ocean through depth;
[766] [766] Like lotus, unstained by defects;
[767] [767] Like mountain, unchanging;
[768] [768] Like space, vast without boundary or center;
[769] [769] Like lion, possessing from primordial the confidence surpassing all—
[770] [770] From that same nature:
[771] [771] Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] [772] Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] [773] These are dharmakaya's metaphors.
[774] [774] Thus it is said.
[775] [775] Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] [776] From Self-Arisen:
[777] [777] Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] [778] This is dharmakaya's self-sign.
[779] [779] Thus it is said.
[780] [780] Appearance is like sky-expanse's empty-clarity—
[781] [781] From that same nature:
[782] [782] Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] [783] This is dharmakaya's appearance.
[784] [784] Thus it is said.
[785] [785] Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] [786] From that:
[787] [787] Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[788] [788] This is dharmakaya's place.
[789] [789] Thus it is said.
[790] [790] Characteristic is this:
[791] [791] Essence, nature, compassion—three inseparable—
[792] [792] From that same nature:
[793] [793] Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] [794] This is dharmakaya's characteristic.
[795] [795] Thus it is said.
[796] [796] Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[797] [797] Five lights adorned within, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] [798] In expanse-awareness great inseparability, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] [799] From Self-Arisen:
[800] [800] Clear, luminous, unmixed—three:
[801] [801] This is dharmakaya's object.
[802] [802] Thus it is said.
[803] [803] Intent is this:
[804] [804] View unsevered by direction or side,
[805] [805] Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[806] [806] Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
