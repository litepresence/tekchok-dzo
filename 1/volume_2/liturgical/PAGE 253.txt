Fourth, kaya—five aspects:
Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.

Essence: abiding as support of nirvana dharmas, nature always dwelling.

Definition: stainless transparent-penetrate, great self-complete.

Division: dharma-kaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—three.

Though common vehicles consider three kayas as result, Great Perfection's system considers three kayas as path appearance. Dharma-kaya is own-appearance—as long as dharma exists, mind exists, this is path. As long as kaya exists, body exists, this is path appearance—not final.

This main reaching complete measure is exhaustion appearance, dissolving near primordially pure.

Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are path appearance—various appearing dharmas exist in rank, not final extreme-free mark-free equality.

At measure-reaching time, kayas, fields, and teachers appear from spontaneously accomplished appearance.

Characteristic: path appearance clear-light empty nature.

Result: when primordially pure jewel secret inside moves, inner clear three kayas dwell only as arise-basis.

Familiarizing with such path appearance kaya reality, obtained appear-experience three kaya signs.

From Blazing Relics:

Kaya measure trained,
Upon fortunate person,
Before, signs like this:
Who familiar with dharma-kaya,
Body not seen by others
In their seen activity-field,
Yogin plays self-freely.
Samadhi of not-seeking, placed,
Arises in own continuum,
Awareness not-thinking experience,
Appears in all yogins' minds.
Thus arisen persons
See dharma-kaya appearance,
Seeing this, all buddhas'
Kayas gather in expanse.

Signs of familiarity and confidence with sambhogakaya:
Person experiencing thus
Plays in five kayas, five wisdoms,
By gaze of great play—
Thus possessing signs,
That fortunate possessing yogin,
Upon empty bindu lamp
Arising without effort,
Appearance also becoming kaya,
Person seeing gradually
Sees sambhogakaya root by this.

Continuum familiar thus,
Speech clear, possessing voice,
Words of lying say
Not arising from this mouth—
Likewise words of non-virtue action
