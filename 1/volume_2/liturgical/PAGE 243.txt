Dwelling with people of borderlands, experiencing their ways;
Heart trembling always;
Body hair standing upright;
Letters self-arising from fingernail centers;
Teeth growing even in old age;
Showing blessings upon others' bodies;
Leaping into sky while legs crossed;
Wheels existing in palm centers;
Nets connecting the toes;
Light emanating from the mouth;
Feelings of coming and going;
Knowing emanation of body into animal forms;
Small relics falling from limbs;

Behold—gods and asuras appearing to fight;
Knowing letters and designs previously unknown;
Sounds emanating from the eyes;
Able to converse with non-human beings;
Binding outer winds at will;
Holding sun and moon in one's grasp;
Knowing when others' elements will stir;
Fire sparks emanating from the body;
Wondrous sounds arising from clapping palms.

Of dream signs bringing uncertainty, sixty-six in number:

Always teaching dharma in dreams,
Listening,
Reading,
Holding,
Meditating,
Seeing divine forms,
Stupas,
Palaces,
Prophetic visions,
Sitting upon lion thrones,
Seeing various places never before known,
Seeing sravakas and bodhisattvas,
Climbing crystal stupas,
Ascending golden stairs,
Meditating in snow plains,
Flying through sky, seeing buddha-fields,
Riding lions to the ten directions,
Striking others with crystal spears,
Liberating beings from lower realms,
Dreaming of crossing samsara's river,
Dreaming of exchanging bodies,
Seeing buddhas' faces,
Finding jewel treasures,
Dreaming of leading beings to refuge.
