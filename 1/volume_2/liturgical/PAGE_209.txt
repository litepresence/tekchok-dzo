[8960] Because not existing in the field of appearance,
[8961] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8962] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8963] Thus it is spoken.

[8964] This has a reason to be understood; intelligent ones should know it.
[8965] Naturally easy to realize, saying body-appear has no contradiction,
[8966] For the confused, it should be explained that space-awareness and lamp-appearance in outer sky are easy to realize.
[8967] The reason for understanding within oneself is as before.
[8968] Fifth, the manner of special determination:
[8969] By the essential point of awareness without change,
[8970] First, though transcending from base and deluding in samsara, awareness does not go bad.
[8971] Then, when the lama introduces the face, losing and wandering, later at deciding time there is joy.
[8972] At first losing, the two awarenesses of delusion-time have no good-bad distinction.
[8973] Awareness not meditated and
[8974] At time of meditating, without distinction,
[8975] At time of wandering and
[8976] At time of passing, awareness has no good-bad.
[8977] At time of going to sleep and
[8978] At time of waking and
[8979] At time of going-coming, awareness has no good-bad distinction, like thus.
[8980] However, there is only dream joy-suffering of good-bad appearance manner;
[8981] Depending on that, one meditates the path.
[8982] It is not hope that essence goes to good,
[8983] For awareness has no transfer-change.
[8984] Thus also from Self-Arising:
[8985] E ma ho!
[8986] This precious jewel nectar,
[8987] At the time of beginningless time,
[8988] I lost the precious jewel.
[8989] At that time, wandering wrongly in suffering.
[8990] That precious jewel nectar,
[8991] Has no place to find by searching.
[8992] Self-arisen from self, realized by self.
[8993] That precious jewel nectar,
[8994] Not feeling loss, feeling finding.
[8995] By losing, things without characteristics;
[8996] Possessing joy's glow by finding.
[8997] Time of finding and time of losing,
[8998] Realized in one state without distinction.
[8999] Thus it is spoken.

[9000] Moreover, that losing in self-awareness's state, though finding from self's state,
[9001] From self-awareness's one wheel,
