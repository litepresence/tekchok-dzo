[12862] Seventh, three in birth-place purifying rite: purifying at death-time, purifying on corpse, purifying after. First, from Sun-Moon Union:
[12863] By preparation of letter A,
[12864] Join breath and that number;
[12865] If not dying in that interval,
[12866] By breath placing mouth in crown,
[12867] Also in body's center by consciousness,
[12868] Focus A and gather.
