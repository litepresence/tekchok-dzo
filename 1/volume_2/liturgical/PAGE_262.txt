[11380] That peaceful-wrathful both arise, consciousness dissolves into sky. At time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, liberate without reality bardo, buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is future part separate from this support.
[11381] If peaceful kaya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberates in samadhi five days.
[11382] Samadhi days called concentration ground part—yogins have long-short difference.
[11383] If wrathful kaya arises, from eye arises Vajrasattva nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberates in five instant parts.
[11384] Thus from Blazing Relics:
[11385] If both arise,
[11386] This without bardo,
[11387] Essence primordially-pure great,
[11388] This becomes possessing confidence.
[11389] Five days see truth,
[11390] That also dissolves into buddha.
[11391] If wrathful kaya arises,
[11392] This in reality bardo,
[11393] In five instant parts,
[11394] Liberates, dakini.
[11395] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11396] If peaceful kaya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation kaya.
[11397] If wrathful kaya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation kaya.
[11398] That peaceful kaya arising, delivering clear-light path, liberating transparent-penetrate into primordially-pure ground, own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordially-pure separates that emanation appearance, not ground for own-appearance emanation arising.
[11399] However, other-appearance is basis for sambhogakaya-nirmanakaya arising, other benefit activity arises depending on that, though know primordially-pure lacks actual emanation appearance portion.
[11400] That wrathful kaya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance, at liberation time, spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance arises, stays a moment.
