That peaceful-wrathful both arise, consciousness dissolves into sky. At time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, liberate without reality bardo, buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is future part separate from this support.

If peaceful kaya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberates in samadhi five days.

Samadhi days called concentration ground part—yogins have long-short difference.

If wrathful kaya arises, from eye arises Vajrasattva nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberates in five instant parts.

Thus from Blazing Relics:

If both arise,
This without bardo,
Essence primordially-pure great,
This becomes possessing confidence.
Five days see truth,
That also dissolves into buddha.
If wrathful kaya arises,
This in reality bardo,
In five instant parts,
Liberates, dakini.

From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:

If peaceful kaya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation kaya.
If wrathful kaya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation kaya.

That peaceful kaya arising, delivering clear-light path, liberating transparent-penetrate into primordially-pure ground, own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordially-pure separates that emanation appearance, not ground for own-appearance emanation arising.

However, other-appearance is basis for sambhogakaya-nirmanakaya arising, other benefit activity arises depending on that, though know primordially-pure lacks actual emanation appearance portion.

That wrathful kaya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance, at liberation time, spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance arises, stays a moment.
