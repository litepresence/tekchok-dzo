[8827] [8827] Constriction by essential point, and
[8828] [8828] The experience-appearance arising from that.
[8829] [8829] First, also general placing-method, and
[8830] [8830] Particular essential-method, two:
[8831] [8831] First:
[8832] [8832] From Self-Arising:
[8833] [8833] In the sky of self-appearing Dharma-nature,
[8834] [8834] Awareness-wisdom without distraction,
[8835] [8835] When placed in hold-free state,
[8836] [8836] See pure wisdom's self-appearance;
[8837] [8837] Reverse non-awareness's delusion-appearances.
[8838] [8838] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8839] [8839] Upon the banner without setting,
[8840] [8840] The lamp without change is clear.
[8841] [8841] Upon wisdom without concepts,
[8842] [8842] The five lights without clear-obscure are clear.
[8843] [8843] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8844] [8844] Upon jewel precious nectar,
[8845] [8845] By doing and meditating, one does not find.
[8846] [8846] Upon lamp's space-appearance,
[8847] [8847] Examine without distraction, clear, without holding.
[8848] [8848] Thus, not distracted from meaning,
[8849] [8849] This is the precious nectar lamp.
[8850] [8850] Without release and placing, the supreme finding;
[8851] [8851] Without holding, self-liberation.
[8852] [8852] Thus it is spoken.
[8853] [8853] Second:
[8854] [8854] From Thalgyur:
[8855] [8855] Body's essential point is by resonance.
[8856] [8856] Wisdom's posture is by pure.
[8857] [8857] Bindu coils and stirs, accomplishing.
[8858] [8858] Light extends and gathers.
[8859] [8859] Connection-possessed restraining is wind's essential point.
[8860] [8860] Entering action is distinguished by end.
[8861] [8861] By that changer, wind ceases.
[8862] [8862] Join with delusion's encounter.
[8863] [8863] Awareness's essential point: releasing and
[8864] [8864] Coiling, placing in sky.
[8865] [8865] Space's essential point: gathering and
[8866] [8866] Drawing, joining element-overflow.
[8867] [8867] Appearance's essential point: increasing and ceasing,
[8868] [8868] Various self-liberations.
[8869] [8869] Thus it is spoken.
[8870] [8870] Moreover, when seeing body, look at that perfect essential point's resonance without changing.
[8871] [8871] When at wisdom-fortress-mouth etc., posture does not change.
[8872] [8872] When bindu does not expand, roll to eye-center and constrict light-root.
[8873] [8873] When light overflows, place at brow.
[8874] [8874] When concepts scatter, bind and emit wind.
[8875] [8875] Awareness's essential point: release nadi-thread to sky.
[8876] [8876] Space's essential point: gather to center, lead from eye-corners, look.
[8877] [8877] These are all essential points.
[8878] [8878] Second, thus when taking experience, the essential points of space-awareness gradually arising through experience:
[8879] [8879] From first experience-taking until perfect end.
