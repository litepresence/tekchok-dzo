[57] The extensive explanation of outer-arising,
[58] And the extensive explanation of inner-arising.
[59] First among these:
[60] Essence,
[61] Definitive terminology,
[62] Purpose,
[63] Characteristics,
[64] Sequence of functions,
[65] Dharma-nature,
[66] Applied meaning,
[67] Manner of liberation,
[68] Divisions,
[69] And the tenfold manner of completeness.
[70] First, the essence:
[71] Outer-arising appearing as form is the play of inner-arising's actuality;
[72] Therefore, gathered within the inner domain, these are the five-arising.
[73] From the Self-Arisen:
[74] The outer-arising are thus:
[75] Earth and water and fire,
[76] And likewise wind and space.
[77] Thus it is said.
[78] The five forms of outer-arising become the appearing container-support for beings;
[79] The five actualities of inner-arising become the support for mind and awareness.
[80] From the Thal 'gyur:
[81] The assertion regarding arising is thus:
[82] From the particularities of general-common karma,
[83] By individual karma-supports of beings,
[84] Relying upon the outer-arising,
[85] Karma, sustenance, and faculties,
[86] Entourage and birth—complete.
[87] Thus.
[88] Second, the definitive terminology:
[89] From the Self-Arisen:
[90] The definitive terminology of arising is thus:
[91] Not made by fabrication, spontaneously complete;
[92] By that which produces, they are arising;
[93] Pervading all migrators, they are great-arising;
[94] By simultaneous birth, they are great-arising;
[95] Existing in themselves, they are great-arising;
[96] Without change, they are great-arising;
[97] Appearing harmoniously, they are great-arising.
[98] The definitive terminology of great-arising—thus.
[99] Thus.
[100] Third, the purpose:
[101] From the Thal 'gyur:
[102] The inquiry into arising's purpose is thus:
[103] Water gathers the clear essence
[104] And separates the impurities—this is its function.
[105] As it acts within each individual body,
[106] Its purpose is known as heat and cold.
[107] Earth holds the foundation
[108] And performs establishing and cohering functions.
[109] By ripening, it produces roots and so forth;
[110] Its purpose is known as the relative thigle.
[111] Fire increases the arising
[112] And performs ripening and clarifying functions.
[113] By blazing and spreading, it produces eyes and so forth;
[114] Its purpose is made known as warmth.
[115] Wind scatters and lifts
[116] And performs moving and quivering functions.
[117] By moving and trembling, it holds the body;
[118] Its purpose is known as the abode of mind.
[119] The four arising—the great mandala of self—
[120] Become the cause for accomplishing body and so forth,
[121] Abide in the middle and perform the holding function,
[122] And in the end perform all destruction functions.
[123] Through one cause, the great arising
[124] Appear as the master performing the various.
[125] Thus, regarding intention, self and other,
[126] Skilled in the meaning of completed action.
[127] Thus.
[128] Fourth, the characteristics—from among five:
[129] Earth-characteristic: solidity.
