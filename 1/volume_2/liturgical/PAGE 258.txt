From that:

Thus realized person,
Existing-non-existing qualities inconceivable,
Wisdom dwelling as one,
Great teacher self-showing self,
Primordial tone dwelling in self without arrangement,
From nature of method and wisdom,
Buddha race also appearing as two,
All this appearing as that retinue,
From ground-appearance without nature,
Appearing as dharma unspeakable, unthinkable, inexpressible,
Also equality of three times,
Primordially all these self-dwelling.

Third: from single only signs, from two mixed, from three possessing—if body signs complete, liberate in bardo; if body and speech two exist suitably, possessing speech signs on body, liberate in emanation field; if mind signs complete, liberate in bardo in three instants; if all three complete, do other benefit with compassion, knowing self-benefit obtain certainty, blessed for countless lives, doing benefit, that support liberates into light; if body and mind signs two exist, obtain self-benefit quickly and liberate; if speech and mind signs gather, obtain light-body in ten years; also if three signs of body, speech, and mind gather, other benefit not arising, liberate in two years.

From that:

Effort-possessing person,
Body signs complete,
In bardo reality,
See truth, buddha.
Body possessing speech signs,
This in emanation field,
Breath-out, take one birth.
Who possesses mind signs,
This between two births
Of life formation,
Like shooting star in sky,
In three instants as shooting way,
With emanation also,
Self-dissolves into essence.
If body, speech, mind signs gather,
This great bodhicitta,
Compassion possessing beings' holder,
This for holding beings,
In hundred thousand million years,
Even with one human body,
Completing this meaning,
Not entering between two births,
Complete attainment.
Also whoever fortunate,
Possessing body and mind signs,
Thus possessing, in ten years,
Dissolves elements to self-place,
Appearance not appearing,
Delivers to pure reality ground.
Who body, speech, mind signs,
Thus to fortunate person,
To whoever fortunate gathering,
Even in two years from this,
Dissolves this elements to self,
Without doubt this changes.
