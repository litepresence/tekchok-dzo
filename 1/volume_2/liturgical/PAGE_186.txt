Salt all's taste certainty reached, or molasses and fire—one recognition, knowing all knowing—like.

From Byang-chub-sems-'grel:
*/ Fire's nature heat,
*/ Molasses nature sweet like.
*/ Thus dharmas all also,
*/ Nature empty single.

Thus like.

Thus liberation-manner five, person one calculate not—faculties' difference by, what aspiration, liberation is.

Third: liberation-manner five's conclusion five show. That also here: liberation-manner five those reference-basis apart. Rang-grol is: grasping view, meditation, conduct dharma's reference apart. Conditions conditions by liberated—example like dirt by dirt washed. Condition bad, condition bad by liberated, ye-she's companion appear. Ka-dag ka-dag by liberated, rig-pa rig-pa by liberated.

Ye-grol: grasping-grasped unity reference apart. Objects objects by liberated—poison by poisons destroyed like.

Cer-grol: samsara-nirvana two not-referenced, cause causes liberated—example iron by iron cut like.

Mtha'-grol: convention word not-referenced, dharma dharma liberated's example—wood from arisen fire, that wood that burned like.

Gcig-grol: liberating-doer thought not-referenced, mind-itself mind liberated's example—stone by stones cut like.

From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
*/ Conditions conditions by liberated because,
*/ Grasping dharmas to not-reference.
*/ Objects objects liberated to,
*/ Grasping-grasped two not-reference.
*/ Cause cause liberated to,
*/ Samsara-nirvana two not-reference.
*/ Dharma dharma liberated to,
*/ Convention word not-reference.
*/ Mind-itself mind liberated to,
*/ Indicating-doer thought not-reference.
*/ Dirt by dirt washed like,
*/ Thus pure pure liberated.
*/ Poison's poisons destroyed,
*/ Iron's irons cut,
*/ Stone's stones severed,
*/ Wood's woods burned like.
*/ Self-self enemy self does,
*/ Lineage not-different liberation not.

Thus.

That-also: all rig-pa complete not-existing's essence by, rig-pa liberated time, dharmas all liberated—support-basis destroyed, support-dharma destroy like...
