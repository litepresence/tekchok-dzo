The Grounds of Power and Spontaneity

Four there are: the ground of power over life, the ground of the Great Seal, and the ground of spontaneous accomplishment. Yet these persons do not swiftly attain the fruit; having first obtained their respective grounds, they must remain for long periods training to bring them to perfection, as proclaimed in the Blazing Reliquary Tantra:

When earth trembles at the time
A being separates from breath,
This one obtains the sravaka ground.
Likewise, should it tremble in three days,
The self-same ground gives rise to motion—
This is the pratyekabuddha's ground.
When in six days it comes to be,
This is the bodhisattva's ground,
Entering therein, O dakini.
If in nine days it should come
That earth does tremble and transform,
This one has power to freely roam
The ground of the vidya-dhara.
Yet buddhahood's fruit does not appear
To one endowed with trembling grounds;
Thus in grounds and paths alike
Long cultivation must one dwell.

Those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles' entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicle's path and stages only to the nature of causes. This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus. Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.

Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.

The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms' confusion. This has two aspects: the general arrangement and the presentation of actual signs.

First: For all sentient beings there are two paths to go, two results—making four in all. Without the intermediate state of dharmata and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible. Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.
