[11977] Yet at the time of death, the appearance of hell-fire,
[11978] The appearance of hunger, thirst, and fear,
[11979] Consciousness becoming gloomy, or thinking one dwells among animals,
[11980] Or not seeing lands of humans before,
[11981] Or the experience inside Meru or inside the ocean,
[11982] Or appearances of seeing inside divine mansions or pleasure groves,
[11983] Or seeing appearances like white clarity—these are explained in the sūtras as inner signs certain for individual six realms.
[11984] Also from the tantra sections:
[11985] Warmth from the soles of the feet,
[11986] Teeth,
[11987] Navel, and
[11988] Throat,
[11989] Between the eyebrows,
[11990] And dissolving from the crown are said to be signs of taking birthplaces of the six realms.
[11991] Also, though signs that have arisen appear in agreement with one's own mind, they should be known as certain signs of individual birthplaces.
[11992] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[11993] The certain establishment of the arrangement of signs of the three times—the twenty-second chapter.
[11994] Thus having shown the sequence of signs, the method of liberation in this life for those of excellent faculties, effort, and places of the general instruction,
[11995] Now, for establishing extensively the Dharma arrangement of completely perfect buddhahood in the bardo for those of medium faculties, there are two:
[11996] The general establishment of the intermediate state and
[11997] The extensive explanation of individual natures.
[11998] First, regarding the essence of the intermediate state:
[11999] Definition,
[12000] Division,
[12001] Appearance pattern,
[12002] And ground boundary—five aspects.
[12003] First, the essence:
[12004] The situation of outer objects and inner mind appearing as dharmas.
[12005] Furthermore, all appearances other than inner space of primordial purity are the situation of the intermediate state.
[12006] The aspect of appearance of the face of self-arising activity through the two form bodies from the self-radiance of ground-appearance appearing as body and wisdom is the pure intermediate state of dharmatā,
[12007] While all impure dharmas of deluded appearance of the six realms are the intermediate state of delusion.
[12008] Between which of these two dharmas of pure and impure does it exist?
[12009] Since from the space of primordial purity it must dissolve back into primordial purity through outward movement, it exists in the interval of primordially pure nature.
[12010] First, that also arises from that.
