Signs of familiarity with expanse—five aspects:
Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.

Essence: vast, pervading great, clear by nature, self-clear.

Definition: called center, called expanse—the nature of reality things, vast, without end.

Division: outer expanse sky, inner expanse lamp, secret expanse light and bindu, unsurpassed expanse great appearance of confusion-appearance self-ceasing.

According to rank: awareness, wisdom, three kayas, result object.

Characteristic: vast and opening, able to appear, pervading, appearing as clear object, like clear mirror expanse.

Briefly: not reality thing, produces power to clearly appear as object making reality appear.

Result: depending on not-mistakenly understanding reality object, seeing reality own essence, making direct non-change into path, buddhahood.

Familiarizing with such expanse, wondrous outer signs appear as experience.

From Blazing Relics:

Who is familiar with expanse,
Outer-inner breath movement ceases,
Goes like bird in sky,
Likewise like fish in water—
This fortunate one goes,
And sees objects not seen before,
Continent and Meru together,
Sees from one sitting place,
Likewise buddha-fields
Not seen before,
All these sees at one time.
Thus possessing signs,
From this in sixteen months,
Dharma-expanse also sees.

Inner experience-signs:
From Vajrasattva's heart mirror,
These before-signs arise in that person:
Joyful experience sitting alone,
Body light like cotton leaf,
