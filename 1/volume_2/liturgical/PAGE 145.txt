[6139] This nature of delusion-vision—
[6140] Not seen before as wisdom,
[6141] From basis of delusion with concept not existing,
[6142] Realizing all-ground as great dharmakaya,
[6143] Delusion's self-concept continuum ceases.

[6144] Thus, non-deluded vision
[6145] Arises from the split vital point primordially.

[6146] Buddha-body of beings' aggregates,
[6147] Primordially existing—who did not know?
[6148] Aggregates as Buddha-lord,
[6149] Arising from letters abiding in channels.

[6150] Wisdom in bubbles and eyes—
[6151] Who has not seen as self-vision?

[6153] From the Mu tig phreng ba:

[6154] Regarding nature-vision dharmas:
[6155] Subtle and coarse reversed through non-defilement;
[6156] Delusion reversed through non-grasping-holding;
[6157] Action-wind reversed through non-movement;
[6158] Entity reversed through copper-shining;
[6159] Emptiness reversed through clarity;
[6160] Generation stage reversed through primordial realization;
[6161] Conduct reversed through non-effort;
[6162] Meditation reversed through non-seeking placement;
[6163] Vision reversed through self-freedom;
[6164] View reversed through manifest vision;
[6165] Terms reversed through non-sound-words;
[6166] Attachment reversed through not experiencing existence;
[6167] Other-dependence reversed through not experiencing non-existence;
[6168] Mental examination reversed through non-grasping;
[6169] Number-end reversed through uniqueness;
[6170] Other arising and ceasing through all-pervading.

[6171] Darkness buddha-ed through self-dawning;
[6172] Dharmakaya pervading through essence;
[6173] Sambhogakaya expanding through clear vision;
[6174] Emanation body arising through mother-child meeting;
[6175] Method arising through existent realization;
[6176] Memory buddha-ed through thought-exceeding;
[6177] Establishment view complete through non-eternal-cut.

[6179] Again:

[6180] Exceeding ground, direction, and limit;
[6181] Non-existent existence, non-existence, and like-vision;
[6182] Not activity-field of all sounds and measures;
[6183] No field of counting one, two.
[6184] Accomplished by descending into great emptiness;
[6185] Not activity-field of scripture and reason;
[6186] Not indicated by tantra and instruction.

[6187] Through view, meditation, and conduct,
[6188] That meaning will not be known.
[6189] That meaning: no accomplishment as result;
[6190] Dharmas obscure that itself.

[6191] Not accomplished by thinking;
[6192] Not to be examined even by wisdom.

[6193] Through giving, ethics, and patience,
[6194] That itself separate from harm-benefit result.

[6195] Through hearing, thinking, and meditation,
[6196] Not seeing that, even examining supreme.

[6197] No mandala therein;
[6198] No deity, no generation seed;
[6199] What to do with mantra and mudra?
[6200] No need to elaborate offerings, etc.;
[6201] Where are power and vow?
[6202] No approach or accomplishment;
[6203] No wheel emanation;
[6204] No protection, no protectable field;
[6205] Exceeding harm and obstacle fields.
