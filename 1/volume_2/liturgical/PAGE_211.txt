[9043] [9043] Sun and moon,
[9044] [9044] Like star forms,
[9045] [9045] Like intermediate-space rainbow,
[9046] [9046] White clear light,
[9047] [9047] Yellow clear,
[9048] [9048] Red clear,
[9049] [9049] Green clear,
[9050] [9050] Blue,
[9051] [9051] Various,
[9052] [9052] Net pattern,
[9053] [9053] Arising rays,
[9054] [9054] Round gatherings,
[9055] [9055] Bindus,
[9056] [9056] Stupas,
[9057] [9057] God-bodies,
[9058] [9058] At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here-there, far-near,
[9059] [9059] By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[9060] [9060] From Thalgyur:
[9061] [9061] From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[9062] [9062] Also of color and shape,
[9063] [9063] Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[9064] [9064] Certainly expanding from above to above.
[9065] [9065] At this time, body-speech bliss signs;
[9066] [9066] Join with appearance measure and manner.
[9067] [9067] Thus it is spoken.
[9068] [9068] Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
[9069] [9069] From first red-yellow round,
[9070] [9070] Later appears as five-light rim.
[9071] [9071] Also from moving by wind's essential point,
[9072] [9072] Essential point of holding outward slowly.
[9073] [9073] Then by taking clear portion as experience,
[9074] [9074] Lamp like mirror,
[9075] [9075] Light like slice,
[9076] [9076] Expanding with body from bindu like bowl.
[9077] [9077] From that:
[9078] [9078] Thus pressing appearance:
[9079] [9079] First pure red,
[9080] [9080] Complete empowerment, round, complete self-clear.
[9081] [9081] From two pure fingers become three.
[9082] [9082] Then by pressing again and again,
[9083] [9083] The colors of five wisdoms—
[9084] [9084] White, red, green, blue, yellow—
[9085] [9085] Appear in field, effort.
[9086] [9086] Then also outer without effort,
[9087] [9087] Go-come by wind's portion,
[9088] [9088] From mirror-pure shape like,
[9089] [9089] Appear as portions of two and three.
[9090] [9090] From constant familiarity with that itself,
[9091] [9091] Also by five-color light,
[9092] [9092] Edge-cut appears from mere slice,
[9093] [9093] See measure from mere field-edge.
[9094] [9094] From finding familiarity measure from that,
[9095] [9095] With body to bindu center,
[9096] [9096] Abide while in pure half-body,
[9097] [9097] To that with five-five pairs,
[9098] [9098] Connect with very clear bindu,
[9099] [9099] Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[9100] [9100] Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.
[9101] [9101] Thus it is spoken.
[9102] [9102] At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.
