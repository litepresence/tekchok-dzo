[12606] Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[12607] And doing the wheel of elemental dependent origination,
[12608] Through the three—deceiving demons with ransoms—explained to reverse even from exhausted life.
[12609] From that itself:
[12610] When signs arise in the body thus,
[12611] The rite of deceiving death is explained.
[12612] Beginning the karma of reversing the birth-being,
[12613] With one's own master and virtue assembly,
[12614] Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[12615] Pleasing with gifts and feasts,
[12616] Begin these rites.
[12617] For equal portions of elemental sounds,
[12618] On the palm tree's leaf,
[12619] The wheel of the five elements,
[12620] With four calculations, center and rim,
[12621] Wheels of earth, water, fire, wind, and sky,
[12622] Make five wheels,
[12623] Divided by colors according to elements.
[12624] In the center wall and five,
[12625] Five letters of each self,
[12626] Surrounded by the group of Ali at the rim.
[12627] Having written wheels thus,
[12628] Worship, praise, and confess impurity,
[12629] Make prayers according to each individual's desire.
[12630] Thinking of the elemental god in the center,
[12631] Recite and insert the number of letters.
[12632] Then in a fitted clay vessel,
[12633] Inserting all those wheels,
[12634] Bind crosswise with five colored threads.
[12635] Wood, water, fire, and earth,
[12636] In the mouth-vapor of disagreeing races,
[12637] Mix all that with dough-food,
[12638] Make a form of one cubit in the mixture.
[12639] Letters on the five faculties,
[12640] Write on paper and put inside unfolded.
[12641] By that restore weak elements.
[12642] If seized by demons,
[12643] Dough-food the extent of the birth-being's age,
[12644] Change the color itself,
[12645] With cloth-pieces of one's own stains,
[12646] Also elemental substances like that,
[12647] Mix with food and form.
[12648] With wool-colors, silk, and feathers,
[12649] Adorn those forms.
[12650] Also tormas agreeing with those,
[12651] Those too are like that.
[12652] In the last of that form, the dough-food,
[12653] Surround by the yogin's number of years.
[12654] Having blessed, recite these words:
[12655] "Take, take, O powerful ones,
[12656] Craving, attachment, grasping,
[12657] Remembering, seizing, thinking, and touching.
