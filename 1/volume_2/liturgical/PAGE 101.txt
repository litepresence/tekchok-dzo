The manner of Dharmakaya's abiding—
Who knows this body's key point,
Compatible with that, the yogin
Becomes pure in great bliss of Dharmakaya.

Thus it was spoken.

By performing the three bodies' postures,
One does not transgress the intent of the three bodies.
The hunched nirmanakaya—sign of future liberation through asceticism;
The elephant sambhogakaya—sign of future spontaneous liberation through non-action;
The lion dharmakaya—sign of future genuine fearless liberation.

Why does the elemental body's gaze
Transform into the three bodies' gaze?
The three bodies, luminous and clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence.
By making the gaze thus,
One manifests the three intents abiding within.
Since the three bodies exist as one's own constituents,
One's own gaze goes into the three bodies' gaze.

When cold elemental body harmonizes with nirmanakaya—balanced warmth;
When hot—with dharmakaya;
When balanced—with sambhogakaya—auspicious.
Particularly, vision increases swiftly.

If posture is not bent, awareness's self-resonance in body's channels
Does not arise; without raising it, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky.
Therefore gaze is precious.
Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.
When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase;
Moreover, it decreases again. Therefore gaze is precious.

As snake's limbs, though in body, are not manifest—
Bend them and they appear—
So awareness dawns from gaze's key point.

Are postures limited to three only?
If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
