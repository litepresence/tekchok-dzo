[1160] Through Buddha's emanation, the two benefits appear somewhat similar;
[1161] Certain examination of that:
[1162] From self-arisen:
[1163] Know the method of examining emanation like this:
[1164] Even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere,
[1165] In the crown ushnisha, one cluster of hair curling to the right,
[1166] In the heart center, the form of a vajra,
[1167] Birth in royal caste or high caste.

[1168] Conducting conduct suitable to whatever,
[1169] Following in that whatever is spoken,
[1170] Not establishing one's own preferred desires,
[1171] Deed, effort, and grasping naturally not existing,
[1172] Clearing the doubt of whatever beings desire.
[1173] Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya—thus it is spoken.

[1174] Although these marks exist showing that as emanation,
[1175] Whether others are suitable emanations or not is uncertain;

[1187] Thus it is spoken.

[1188] Second, etymology:
[1189] Called "kaya of five families" because appearing as kayas of five different families.

[1190] From that itself:
[1191] In the great wisdom-appearance,
[1192] The etymology of family is thus.

[1193] Thus it is spoken.

[1194] Third, appearance:
[1195] Appearing as father-mother kayas and wisdom.

[1196] From self-arisen:
[1197] The appearance of five kayas and wisdom:
[1198] Appearing in the manner of father-mother two,
[1199] Aspect holding father: kaya of method,
[1200] Aspect holding mother: kaya of wisdom,
[1201] Appearing like method and wisdom two.
[1202] Moreover, method without cessation,
[1203] Wisdom without change.

[1204] Thus it is spoken.

[1205] Fourth, divisions—two aspects:
