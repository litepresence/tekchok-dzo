Outer-inner certain signs exist as liberate measure thus. Liberate not pervaded by merely existing signs. Because liberate pervaded by existing signs, this special is important.

From Blazing Relics:

All body, speech, mind signs,
Some arisen person,
Not completely liberated—
Worldly common siddhi and
Gradually sravaka pratyekabuddha,
All these grounds,
This entered that ground,
Without pure great result.
Who possesses body, speech,
Signs complete person,
Even in equal great ground,
All these go, dakini.

Thus said signs only exist without certainty. Now without any outer-inner liberate signs, gone without meditation, action not harm, meditation not needed. Later do not place skull on head. Though saying view-meditation complete, seeing reality original meaning, know demon enters deceiving other and self both by sending lie.

From that:

Thus not possessing signs,
Entering confidence in own-appearance,
Who claims acceptance that,
Examination view and
Likewise examination meditation—
All these liberate,
This not able,
Long in samsara,
This person also dwells.

That also: instruct with special diligence to leap-over meditation yogin because these signs arise without deception, certain liberation.

From that:

Therefore expanse-awareness familiar important.
Who familiar with expanse and awareness,
Those signs explained above,
Impossible to not arise.
Do diligence as well spoken.

General meaning third: conclusion of signs certain of liberation and confusion in bardo and next life—two aspects.
