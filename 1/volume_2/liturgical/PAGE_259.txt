[11233] Outer-inner certain signs exist as liberate measure thus. Liberate not pervaded by merely existing signs. Because liberate pervaded by existing signs, this special is important.
[11234] From Blazing Relics:
[11235] All body, speech, mind signs,
[11236] Some arisen person,
[11237] Not completely liberated—
[11238] Worldly common siddhi and
[11239] Gradually sravaka pratyekabuddha,
[11240] All these grounds,
[11241] This entered that ground,
[11242] Without pure great result.
[11243] Who possesses body, speech,
[11244] Signs complete person,
[11245] Even in equal great ground,
[11246] All these go, dakini.
[11247] Thus said signs only exist without certainty. Now without any outer-inner liberate signs, gone without meditation, action not harm, meditation not needed. Later do not place skull on head. Though saying view-meditation complete, seeing reality original meaning, know demon enters deceiving other and self both by sending lie.
[11248] From that:
[11249] Thus not possessing signs,
[11250] Entering confidence in own-appearance,
[11251] Who claims acceptance that,
[11252] Examination view and
[11253] Likewise examination meditation—
[11254] All these liberate,
[11255] This not able,
[11256] Long in samsara,
[11257] This person also dwells.
[11258] That also: instruct with special diligence to leap-over meditation yogin because these signs arise without deception, certain liberation.
[11259] From that:
[11260] Therefore expanse-awareness familiar important.
[11261] Who familiar with expanse and awareness,
[11262] Those signs explained above,
[11263] Impossible to not arise.
[11264] Do diligence as well spoken.
[11265] General meaning third: conclusion of signs certain of liberation and confusion in bardo and next life—two aspects.
