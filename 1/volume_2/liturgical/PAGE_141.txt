[5935] [5935] Thirteenth: obtaining Great Collection Wheel of Letters Ground.
[5936] [5936] Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is fourteenth: obtaining Great Samadhi Ground.
[5937] [5937] Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is fifteenth: obtaining Vajra-Holder Ground.
[5938] [5938] Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that, is
[5939] [5939] Sixteenth: obtaining Wisdom-Guru Ground.
[5940] [5940] Those are applied through similar aspects of vision manner, not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.
[5941] [5941] Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness luminosity without purifying or traversing.
[5942] [5942] In meaning, it is one awareness ground.
[5943] [5943] For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed,
[5944] [5944] For they are applied thus to different entry-doors of path vitals.
[5945] [5945] The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and
[5946] [5946] Mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification.
[5947] [5947] From that itself:
[5948] [5948] Therefore, although inconceivable beings exist, there is not more than one wisdom essence.
[5949] [5949] "Ground" and "path" do not exist separately.
[5950] [5950] Know that there is no need to purify or traverse ground and path.
[5951] [5951] From the Kun byed:
[5952] [5952] Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified.
[5953] [5954] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[5954] [5955] Showing the summary of the Luminous Vajra Essence Path, the eighteenth chapter.
[5955] [5956] Thus, having shown the actual path,
[5956] [5957] Now, regarding the path's difference: for great powers, the supreme means of freeing without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of cutting (Trekcho)—has three parts:
[5957] [5958] Cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point,
[5958] [5959] Binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point,
[5959] [5960] Clearing obstacles through cutting freedom-confidence at the point.
[5960] [5961] First has three:
[5961] [5962] Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort in the nature of great perfection.
