Inner: dharmata field main-point;
Dawn cause: gate main-point;
Wind abiding: three main-points clear path,
Secret: habituation measure sequence,
Ripen: sign sequence,
Ultimate end: exhaust sequence,
And take measure with three,
Supreme vision.

Ripen: point;
Complete: body and three fruit complete cause;
Three group: four determine,
Therefore called three.

Or: dharmata three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing,
Self-resonance vision three,
Outer dawn number;
Dharmakaya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;
Sambhogakaya self-resonance: light five outer clear,
Wisdom self-clear;
Nirmanakaya self-resonance: dawn liberation,
Equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,
Rely therefore called three.

That also: base three establish base,
Entity not-existing difference main-point,
And path three clear obstacle,
Path not-existing near far,
And measure three deliver measure,
Not-existing similar different random,
And fruit three exhaust end deliver,
Not-existing yes-no doubt,
Therefore called direct.

Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity,
Dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;
Guru instruction experience take time:
Direct see three—dhatu, awareness, dharmas.

Dharmata direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;
Habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision,
See three-bodies' light point;
Measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure;
Main-point: dharmata self-exhaust.

Thus: three enumeration place other rely,
Determine simultaneous liberate fruit.

Vision: whatever dawn, dharmata dawn;
Field: whatever dawn, dhatu dawn;
Manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house,
Awareness hanging-cord with dawn.

Buddha: not-seeing with stone,
Fruit: take that vision experience.

Thus: dharmata direct vision essence—
Dhatu awareness luminous-clear vision.
