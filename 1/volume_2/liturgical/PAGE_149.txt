[6357] [6357] When either of those two minds dawns:
[6358] [6358] Dawned outward: outer object;
[6359] [6359] Dawned inward: inner body.
[6360] [6360] Examining dust-particles without parts, dividing layer by layer,
[6361] [6361] Seeing arising-place's vision-object non-existent, recognizing mind did not arise from that—cutting connection to great root-free basis of concept holding grasped object.
[6362] [6362] If arising-agent sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mental-events arise from themselves, momentary knowing becomes two substances;
[6363] [6363] Examining complete: not arising from self or other.
[6364] [6364] Now, thinking that arising-place arises self-arisen:
[6365] [6365] Color,
[6366] [6366] Shape,
[6367] [6367] Sign,
[6368] [6368] Characteristic,
[6369] [6369] Big-small,
[6370] [6370] Direction-part, etc.—examining what exists, not abiding anywhere.
[6371] [6371] Merely mind-examined, basisless, gone everywhere primordially pure,
[6372] [6372] Inner holding-concept, basisless like sky, realized by self,
[6373] [6373] All grasping-holding appearing as dharma and dharmata, realized at that time as great support-free without object.
[6374] [6374] Realizing today mind's primordial non-arising at first—understanding meaning of great elaboration-free dharmakaya.
[6375] [6375] Second: middle abiding-place and abiding-agent.
[6376] [6376] Third: likewise destroying and examining end going-place and going-agent two,
[6377] [6377] Touching intention of great self-luminous Sambhogakaya and
[6378] [6378] Self-free self-dawning emanation body.
[6379] [6379] Outer-inner objectless, unsupported awareness;
[6380] [6380] Grasping-holding basisless;
[6381] [6381] Understanding meaning of equal intention without interval.
[6382] [6382] Self-buddha great equality dawning interiorly as unmeditated river-flow samadhi.
[6383] [6383] From the Thal 'gyur:
[6384] [6384] Mind: first arising place,
[6385] [6385] Middle abiding place, end going place.
[6386] [6386] Thus examining and analyzing the three,
[6387] [6387] Purify mind, know mind's abiding manner.
[6388] [6389] At that time, all outer object-vision non-existent, suddenly basisless vision;
[6389] [6390] All inner mind-concepts dawn-free, without trace.
