[584] Altering and transforming—
[585] Not able to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[586] Like earth and sky,
[587] Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[588] The expanse's heart essence, dharmakaya,
[589] Abiding as awareness itself, holding all's basis.
[590] Its abiding palace is
[591] From that very source:
[592] Dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—
[593] Thus it is said.
[594] When that dharmakaya abides within the precious interior,
[595] It is called dharmata's pure original tone,
[596] The house possessing awareness-light,
[597] Abiding in light's display.
[598] This is called the primordial common basis, awareness-expanse,
[599] The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[600] Second, the five fires' extensive explanation, from Self-Arisen:
[601] There are five fires:
[602] Outer-inner all-pervading fire,
[603] Outer-inner all-illuminating fire,
[604] Outer-inner all-equalizing fire,
[605] Outer-inner action's concept fire,
[606] Outer-inner action's accomplishing fire—thus five.
[607] These also, in sequence,
[608] Reside in lungs,
[609] Eyes and five limbs, making six,
[610] Flesh gaps,
[611] Two soles of feet,
[612] And two palms of hands, producing warmth.
[613] Third, the five earths as well:
[614] From that same source:
[615] There are five earths:
[616] All-illuminating earth,
[617] Unchanging vajra earth,
[618] Precious earth from which all arise,
[619] All-pervading earth showing appearances,
[620] Perfected accomplishment earth—thus five.
[621] These also, in sequence,
[622] Together with awareness,
[623] Together with lamp,
[624] Together with thigle,
[625] Together with wisdom,
[626] Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[627] Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arisen:
[628] The five water kinds are:
[629] Unchanging water,
[630] Peaceful, clear, pure water,
[631] Extensively arising qualities' water,
[632] Attachment-free water,
[633] Completion-without-grasping water—thus five.
[634] These also, according to sequence,
[635] Together with all channels—
