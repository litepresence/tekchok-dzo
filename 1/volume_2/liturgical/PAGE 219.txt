[9385] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9386] The intention of mountain's general meaning
[9387] Is like lion's play.
[9388] The intention of wisdom's general filling
[9389] Is like empowerment from king's head.

[9402] First, the preparation preceding introduction:
[9403] From two actual introductions,
[9404] First:
[9405] Prepare dwelling-place direction half with sun's light-ray together, crystal without stain.
[9406] From Introduction Ornament Tantra:
[9407] Dwelling direction indeed to half,
[9408] Aperture possessing sun's light-ray,
[9409] By extending mirror making clear,
[9410] See light's appearance coming outside.
[9411] Thus it is spoken.

[9412] From that, by teacher's blessing demonstrating mirror example of Vajra-Mind introduction previously arisen,
