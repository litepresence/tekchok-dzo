Essence: appearing as deity forms—single kaya, half-kaya, father-mother, mass, great mandala; according to that direction, stupa, wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword, etcetera.

From not reaching creation-completion, letters, hand-symbols, half-kaya, self-single appear; from complete, father-mother, mass, mandala appear.

Division: peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya two.

From Blazing Relics:

To race-possessing nirvana,
That remainder contaminated,
Aggregates' trace burned purified,
To that kaya two—
Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.

From Self-Arisen:

Kaya form two exist,
Peaceful and wrathful said,
Wrathful thus-gone,
Peaceful cannot power emanation.

From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:

Kaya also two,
Peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya.

Continuum: two from essence cause—all beings primordial clear-light kaya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.

Latency exists, not-ripe nature;
Manifest ripe, appearing as relics.

From former:

Beings primordial,
Self-place great ground dwell,
By ripe not-ripe distinction,
Manifest and latency.

Place: much arising from head or spine, though also from other. Here clear-light familiar arising kaya shown arising from those two.

From Blazing Relics:

Likewise kaya from head,
Or from spine vertebrae joint.

Result: rank of obtaining liberation.
