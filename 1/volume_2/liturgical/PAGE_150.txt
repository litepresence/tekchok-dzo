[6391] [6391] Called "dawning in mind-exhaustion the intention of dharma-exhaustion" through seeing great copper-shining without connection between vision and mind.
[6392] [6392] These are said in the Arya Ratnakuta:
[6393] [6393] Kashyapa, herein bodhisattvas mahasattvas begin the diligence of fully searching mind.
[6394] [6394] That mind is not observed outwardly,
[6395] [6395] Not observed inwardly,
[6396] [6396] Not existing and not observed in the interval of both.
[6397] [6397] Not blue,
[6398] [6398] Not yellow, and so forth.
[6399] [6399] Supreme among all diligences to that is the diligence of fully searching mind—thus said.
[6400] [6400] Second: examining one and different—
[6401] [6401] The instruction of destroying mind's house.
[6402] [6402] Moreover: if this called "mind" exists, from what cause does it arise?
[6403] [6403] If non-existent, what are this movement and memory-knowing wheel?
[6404] [6404] Upon what condition do these memory-knowing aspects depend to arise?
[6405] [6405] Without condition, these sudden memory-knowings are unsuitable.
[6406] [6406] If this mind exists as one with body, it would also be destroyed when body is destroyed;
[6407] [6407] If non-existent, with uncertain following-return, body-sickness would come to mind.
[6408] [6408] Unsuitable for before-after birth wheel to come.
[6409] [6409] If "mind" here is one, through one realm's powers ceasing, other realms should also die;
[6410] [6410] If not one, realm minds should differ like realm forms differ; if different, all those insects and beings inside one body
[6411] [6411] Should live when one person's life-time is done.
[6412] [6412] If one, what is this coming of numberless outer-inner beings to one body?
[6413] [6413] If this mind has a returning place,
[6414] [6414] First there must be a cause.
[6415] [6415] If cause exists, conditioned and impermanent, destroyed again—unsuitable for good or bad in actions.
