[12703] By lion's sleep-method of aggregates: placing awareness self in eye, doing mind little interval-space as path. If space and awareness not changing, that person without intermediate state, no doubt in buddha; dying one's breath also becomes slow—thus.
[12704] Space-awareness habituated ones: at death-time, in snow, cave, person, etc., dying without mind-distracted conditions is important. Also by peaceful god:
[12705] Whoever stays near,
[12706] Also not doing grief,
[12707] By this no one becomes distracted
[12708] In buddha remembering, etc.—
[12709] Like thus said.
[12710] Second, doing transfer's key as shown before. That also, at time of life-wind entering consciousness-wind, lifting place from heart, being time, awareness from heart, thinking self's master's body color-filled, throwing by seven or twenty-one hig sounds to brahma-opening, liberating as moment-by penetrate-through in primordially-pure ground.
[12711] From Sun-Moon Union:
[12712] Though four winds cease by sequence,
[12713] At time moved by one great wind—
[12714] From thus:
[12715] Consciousness riding wind, purifying in wind,
[12716] Also precious to send above;
[12717] Precious to gather and throw awareness;
[12718] That also throwing by hig,
[12719] That meeting to master's mouth—thus.
[12720] At time of awareness's wisdom wind entering consciousness, here transferring, instructions hit clear here. From that self:
[12721] At that time, master's instructions,
[12722] Familiarize in self's continuum;
[12723] Also hit clear by these meanings—thus.
[12724] Transfer entering place and place at breath transfer-time, and instruction of space-awareness entering body and wisdom, are two; also in space-awareness, not relying on other conditions of habituated, and relying—explained as two. That is the place of instruction's form becoming three.
[12725] Third, relying on other conditions: at that time, by one without stain in master or vajra brother existence samaya, hitting clear.
