By lion's sleep-method of aggregates: placing awareness self in eye, doing mind little interval-space as path. If space and awareness not changing, that person without intermediate state, no doubt in buddha; dying one's breath also becomes slow—thus.

Space-awareness habituated ones: at death-time, in snow, cave, person, etc., dying without mind-distracted conditions is important. Also by peaceful god:

Whoever stays near,
Also not doing grief,
By this no one becomes distracted
In buddha remembering, etc.—
Like thus said.

Second, doing transfer's key as shown before. That also, at time of life-wind entering consciousness-wind, lifting place from heart, being time, awareness from heart, thinking self's master's body color-filled, throwing by seven or twenty-one hig sounds to brahma-opening, liberating as moment-by penetrate-through in primordially-pure ground.

From Sun-Moon Union:

Though four winds cease by sequence,
At time moved by one great wind—
From thus:
Consciousness riding wind, purifying in wind,
Also precious to send above;
Precious to gather and throw awareness;
That also throwing by hig,
That meeting to master's mouth—thus.

At time of awareness's wisdom wind entering consciousness, here transferring, instructions hit clear here. From that self:

At that time, master's instructions,
Familiarize in self's continuum;
Also hit clear by these meanings—thus.

Transfer entering place and place at breath transfer-time, and instruction of space-awareness entering body and wisdom, are two; also in space-awareness, not relying on other conditions of habituated, and relying—explained as two. That is the place of instruction's form becoming three.

Third, relying on other conditions: at that time, by one without stain in master or vajra brother existence samaya, hitting clear.
