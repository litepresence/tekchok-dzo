[5398] [5398] Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death—
[5399] [5399] The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and
[5400] [5400] The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and
[5401] [5401] Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.
[5402] [5402] If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.
[5403] [5403] Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,
[5404] [5404] Support-ground not existing,
[5405] [5405] The vital point of no ground of return.
[5406] [5406] Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,
[5407] [5407] Now awareness itself is separate from death.
[5408] [5408] Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment,
[5409] [5409] Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"
[5410] [5410] Therefore called "dharmata exhaustion"—the meaningful result.
[5411] [5411] The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable.
[5412] [5412] Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the all-ground consciousness mind exhausted,
[5413] [5413] And purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmata of the three doors of the all-ground part.
[5414] [5414] Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,
[5415] [5415] That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmata,
[5416] [5416] Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmata exhaustion."
[5417] [5417] Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going,
[5418] [5418] The primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—
[5419] [5419] Not like vision as entity and characteristic.
[5420] [5420] At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmata exhaustion.
[5421] [5421] The dharma-possessor object and
[5422] [5422] The dharmata's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor,
[5423] [5423] The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with all-ground.
[5424] [5424] The manner of exhaustion:
[5425] [5425] Gradual and
[5426] [5426] Instantaneous, from the two.
[5427] [5427] Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.
[5428] [5428] Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmata manifestly at first.
