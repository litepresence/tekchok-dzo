Remain penetrating-through, pervade as true-not, fix as root-free. In the nature of great equal dharmata, smiling, put with "ge." Inner grasping's mind-twist nail comes out—this need exists.

Thus realizing object-mind ground-not root-free, going in secret self-awareness grasping-grasped elaboration-free remain-pa, meditating in clear-light nature of space-awareness without gather-separate, introduced by master's word of self-clear primordially-pure great, by four lamps.

Outer space appear-pa's self-radiance light five clear like form-reflection inside mirror; aspect outer-appears yet essence remains inner, knowing like water-moon form-reflection. Do not do joy-play grasp-attachment in appearance.

Looking far in outer appearance's clear-light, inner awareness's clear-light clears near. Awareness without meditation-mind's antidote, wide view of pure vast nature. Clear meditation of self-descend nature-remain. Without accept-reject in clear-light exercise. Obtaining primordially-pure self-clear result: abandoning confusion-appearance without abandoning, blocking confusion-thought without preventing, pure without training dual-grasping, pure from not abandoning fault, spontaneously accomplished without seeking quality.

Meaning of three realms completely liberated: transcending from view's object, transcending from meditation's mind, transcending from exercise's calculate, transcending from result's dharma. In fortune of empty-carrying samsara, spacious field of dharmata manifest-appearance, in good circle of bliss-source land, obtaining self-arisen palace according to desire, meeting self's father-mother with boy appearance holy thought-unthinkable, gathered with spontaneously accomplished light five queen and first lord light-not-change king, time of obtaining eternal-establishment of joy-bliss without separation—thus called.

These scriptures extensively shown before.
