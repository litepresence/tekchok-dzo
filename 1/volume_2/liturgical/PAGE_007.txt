[314] [314] Music, canopies,
[315] [315] Banners, and upper-canopies,
[316] [316] Those appearing surrounding dharmas—
[317] [317] Are complete in the yogi's own body.
[318] [318] Thus.
[319] [319] Explaining these portions extensively:

[346] [346] Banner's portion: name;
[347] [347] Upper-canopy's portion: breath.
[348] [348] Also, from the Mu tig phreng ba, thus stated:
[349] [349] Earth is flesh, entity itself;
[350] [350] Water is blood, gathering itself;
[351] [351] Fire is warmth, ripening all body;
[352] [352] Wind is breath, karma's container;
[353] [353] Space is mind, body's potential;
[354] [354] Sun-moon is eye, making clear;
[355] [355] Male is birth itself;
[356] [356] Female appears as death;
[357] [357] Planet is in mouth, star is teeth;
[358] [358] Cloud is in hair, tree is channels;
[359] [359] Mountain is in body, rock is bones;
[360] [360] Root is in heart, trunk is legs;
[361] [361] Branches are in limbs;
[362] [362] Flower itself is five faculties;
[363] [363] Fruit is accomplished in body;
[364] [364] Smell is pores, taste is skin;
[365] [365] Sound is in voice, touch is sickness;
[366] [366] Music is internal organs, canopy is water;
[367] [367] Parasol is legs, banner is name;
[368] [368] Upper-canopy is breath.
[369] [369] These are complete in the yogi's body.
[370] [370] Thus.
[371] [371] Second, in mind all samsara-nirvana dharmas, base and path, are completely present.
[372] [372] Again from That Very:
[373] [373] All white transcendence dharmas
[374] [374] Are completely present in body-mind;
[375] [375] Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence,
[376] [376] Mandala, deity, offering,
[377] [377] Mantra, mudra, concentration,
[378] [378] Empowerment, samaya,
[379] [379] Instruction-giving, experience,
[380] [380] Likewise development stage,
[381] [381] Hearing, contemplating, meditating,
[382] [382] View, conduct, meditation,
[383] [383] Giving, ethics, patience,
[384] [384] Effort, concentration, wisdom,
[385] [385] Power, aspiration, wisdom,
[386] [386] Likewise method's perfection,
[387] [387] Ten virtues' conduct, and so forth,
[388] [388] Method and wisdom themselves,
[389] [389] Thus, from and so forth,
