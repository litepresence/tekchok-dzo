First cultivating mind by hearing, middle cutting rope by thinking, last repeating la by meditation, making mind easy is like approaching the box. Like entering the box, settling meanings and entering at death-time without danger and fear.

These meanings were extensively shown before; here, condensed practice slightly explained: by looking at outer appearances, seeing appear-objects like the confusion-mandala of illusion. Seeing groundless empty self-form only, all appearing dharma-various as various, arising in the mirror of looking-meditating-exercising, for it is self-power of dharmata's play arising without ceasing.

That too, looking at one in whom dharma-various appear various like white-red general-eat under-garment house, seeing whatever appears, arises, is heard as self-dissolved empty play, putting without hand of blockage with correction, appearances liberate from appearing-ground, confusion liberates as groundless, arising as only illusion's peak, liberated from samsara of grasping outer objects.

Dharma-various—piece mountain, excellent-born, woman, etc.—whatever first arises as appear-object, cutting in pieces, putting greatly greatly wherever appears, consciousness does not enter into great investigation. Appearance not changed by mind, mind not seized by appearance, dissolving in self-place, putting consciousness-group six without prevention in self-place, dharmata's appearance arises spontaneously.

Thus looking at outer dharma-various, knowing as groundless empty self-form, grasping object-not pure like sky, realizing grasping as nature-not, thus called. Thus looking at the looker of outer in consciousness, moving dissolves as empty-dissolve without outline, realizing as suddenly-dissolve not self-clear. Realizing inner dharmata birth-cease ground-not great, grasping dissolves in nature of support-not sky-resembling, spreading.
