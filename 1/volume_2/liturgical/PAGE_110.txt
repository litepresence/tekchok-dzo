[4858] Lu: like good water channel,
[4859] Water emerges without increase or decrease.
[4860] Body and wisdom increase-opening,
[4861] Various path-visions until complete,
[4862] From that, dawning cause.
[4863] Gu: inside that,
[4864] Pull not-mistaken dharmata view and meditation.
[4865] Rgyud: pervading samsara-nirvana,
[4866] From those vision collections,
[4867] Body and
[4868] Point radiating and
[4869] Arising and
[4870] Gathering etcetera, clear cause.
[4871] From Thalgyur:
[4872] Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
[4873] From that, vision becomes four:
[4874] By dharmata direct vision,
[4875] Suppress intellect-grasping view;
[4876] By experience-vision increasing above,
[4877] Cause delusion vision to cease;
[4878] By awareness measure-arriving vision,
[4879] Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
[4880] By dharmata exhausting vision,
[4881] Cut three-realms' samsara stream.
[4882] Thus it was said.
[4883] That also: vision four number determined—
[4884] Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
[4885] Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
[4886] Secret: showing empowerment four determination;
[4887] Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.
[4888] Sequence determined:
[4889] First, base dharmata direct not see,
[4890] Remaining three dawning base not existing—  Basis and supported base,  First: dharmata direct vision dawning.  That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning,  Called self-arisen wisdom self-found.  Then: direct that, if not experience experience,  Word only, fruit not arise;  Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.  Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;  If not firm, experience no end,  Not possessing dharmas,  Buddha not arising cause;  Arrive at firm experience measure cause.
