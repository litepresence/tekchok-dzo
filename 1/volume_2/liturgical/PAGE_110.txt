Lu: like good water channel,
Water emerges without increase or decrease.
Body and wisdom increase-opening,
Various path-visions until complete,
From that, dawning cause.

Gu: inside that,
Pull not-mistaken dharmata view and meditation.
Rgyud: pervading samsara-nirvana,
From those vision collections,
Body and
Point radiating and
Arising and
Gathering etcetera, clear cause.

From Thalgyur:
Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
From that, vision becomes four:
By dharmata direct vision,
Suppress intellect-grasping view;
By experience-vision increasing above,
Cause delusion vision to cease;
By awareness measure-arriving vision,
Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
By dharmata exhausting vision,
Cut three-realms' samsara stream.

Thus it was said.

That also: vision four number determined—
Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
Secret: showing empowerment four determination;
Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.

Sequence determined:
First, base dharmata direct not see,
Remaining three dawning base not existing—
Basis and supported base,
First: dharmata direct vision dawning.
That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning,
Called self-arisen wisdom self-found.

Then: direct that, if not experience experience,
Word only, fruit not arise;
Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise.

Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure;
If not firm, experience no end,
Not possessing dharmas,
Buddha not arising cause;
Arrive at firm experience measure cause.
