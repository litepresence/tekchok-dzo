From Clear-Meaning:
Gathering mind from all,
Inner self unmoving,
Though abide, eye forms—
Seeing mind is sense-born.

Thus explained, like:
Ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—
Awareness essence dharmata
Existing in heart, determine;
That self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause,
Like sun and light-ray,
Certain cause-effect, reasoning faith meet.

That reason: from world and transcend two,
This is transcend direct.
Transcend: object-know mind chief,
Mind cause certain,
And main-point seal see chief,
Awareness direct—two from,
This called awareness direct.

Second: identify self-characteristic,
Called dharmata direct vision.
Apply dharmata word near, four from:
Samsara dharmas,
Called this dharmata nirvana dharmata;
Vision dharmas,
Called this dharmata empty;
Dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
Famous dharmata this dharmata existing liberating certain;
Dhatu dharmas,
Awareness dharmata famous,
Desire non-dual both.

Direct: actually see existing in sense-power activity field;
That also: not rely on intellect—
Intellect wisdom, whatever seek, time not existing to find;
Seeker not eye-possess,
Cause not luminous-clear form-possess.

From Collection:
Investigate wisdom, aggregates' bottom not find.

Thus it was said.

This luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess—
Subtle particle and coarse entity,
Self-characteristic this not existing cause,
Element-four harm, destroy, crush not possible cause;
Form-possess: existing destroy crush possible,
That cause form's characteristic.

Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three,
Establish base with main-point three.
