That also resembling now's clear-light send-ma, like intermediate-state's clear-light early-ma; for reason of joining those two middle, showing appearance like space-awareness send-ma:

Exclamation! Son of the race, this present clear-light is actual self-arisen wisdom; in this nature, put mind without fabricating, and you are buddha in upward penetrate-through. Also look at this appearance not changing; this present clear-light becomes mixed with dharmata mother's clear-light, all appearances arising in buddha-field. At that time, do recognize as self-appearance. At that time, you are buddha in primordially-pure ground.

If not recognized there, at time of clear-light dissolving in spontaneously-accomplished, body and wisdom's appearance arises. From that, wisdom four preparation's appearance arises. From that, spontaneously-accomplished's hundred doors arise—by you, do recognize as self-appearance. After recognizing self-face, recite three times "you are well gone to primordially-pure ground"; self also putting equally moment in that appearance, and also giving clear in that. Liberated certain by that.

From Sun-Moon Union:

If space-awareness not clear,
In dharmata bliss intermediate state,
For grasping awareness's appearance,
Do in mind lights shown before;
By that obtain true appearance.
If those not clear,
At self's master remaining,
Also hit clear above instruction;
If master not exist, vajra brother,
Also do hit clear of knowing—thus.

Like that, hitting instruction continue to dying, or showing benefit to other by three jewel-form instructions at death-time for others of not-agreeing dharma awareness. That also: at that time of outer breath cut, inner breath not cut, do remain in manifest dharmata meaning for moment's interval by self. From that, other person separating from breath, that gap's mouth-nose three and self's mouth-nose three joined, wind going upward in three pieces.
