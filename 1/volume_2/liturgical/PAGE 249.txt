Definition: appearing clear, therefore light.

Division: own-characteristic daytime-holding light, wisdom five own-tone, and light of measure of familiarity from practice increasing above direct experience until reaching measure—two aspects.

Characteristic: self-illuminating without depending on other illuminators.

Result: becoming condition for buddhahood in inconceivable dharma-expanse state.

Familiarizing with such light, confusion-appearance liberates into clear-light, special signs of body and speech appear.

From Blazing Relics:

Who is familiar with light,
In self-seen activity-field,
Earth, water, fire, and wind—
Four-elements appearance self-dissolves,
Gradually enjoying five colors.
Signs not separate from this,
In others' seen activity-field,
Like madness, obstacle-free,
Without attachment to whatever,
Transparently penetrating mountain rocks,
Likewise appearing to enter ground depths,
Transparently penetrating all waters,
Body without clothes,
Naked, obstacle-free to whatever,
Food and desires self-free—
This upon this appearance,
Elements dissolve to self-place,
Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
Without doubt obtain result.

As outer appearance experience-signs,
So inner awareness arises.
Signs of nirvana arise when person enters path without error.

From Self-Arisen:

Ride changeless awareness horse,
Always look at correct light,
Teacher's words indicate great meaning,
Correctly hold this measure of seeing awareness king,
Obtain happiness dwelling alone,
Because own-appearance arises as companion,
Accord with others' minds,
Because not separate from own that,
Become without attachment and clinging,
Because going to own ground,
Not become hostile to whatever,
Because gaining own meaning,
Even like cotton leaf,
Because worms and insects are free.
