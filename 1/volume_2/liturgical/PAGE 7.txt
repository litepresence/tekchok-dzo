[314] Music, canopies,
[315] Banners, and upper-canopies,
[316] Those dharmas appearing surrounding—
[317] Are complete in the yogi's own body.
[318] Thus.
[319] Explaining these portions extensively:

[322] Fire's portion: warmth;
[323] Wind's portion: breath;
[324] Space's portion: mind;
[325] Sun-moon's portion: two eyes;
[326] Male's portion: birth;
[327] Female's portion: death;
[328] Planet's portion: the gate-house of desire and two nostrils;
[329] Star's portion: teeth;

[344] Canopy's portion: urine;
[345] Parasol's portion: legs;
[346] Banner's portion: name;
[347] Upper-canopy's portion: breath.
[348] Also, from the Mutik Trengwa, thus stated:
[349] Earth is flesh, the entity itself;
[350] Water is blood, the gathering itself;
[351] Fire is warmth, ripening all body;
[352] Wind is breath, container of karma;
[353] Space is mind, potential of body;
[354] Sun-moon is eye, making clear;
[355] Male is birth itself;
[356] Female appears as death;
[357] Planet is in mouth, star is teeth;
[358] Cloud is in hair, tree is channels;
[359] Mountain is in body, rock is bones;
[360] Root is in heart, trunk is legs;
[361] Branches are in limbs;
[362] Flower itself is five faculties;
[363] Fruit is accomplished in body;
[364] Smell is pores, taste is skin;
[365] Sound is in voice, touch is sickness;
[366] Music is internal organs, canopy is water;
[367] Parasol is legs, banner is name;
[368] Upper-canopy is breath.
[369] These are complete in the yogi's body.
[370] Thus.
[371] Second, in mind all dharmas of samsara-nirvana, base and path, are completely present.
[372] Again from That Very:
[373] All white dharmas of transcendence
[374] Are completely present in body and mind;
[375] Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence,
[376] Mandala, deity, offering,
[377] Mantra, mudra, concentration,
[378] Empowerment, samaya,
[379] Instruction-giving, experience,
[380] Likewise the development stage,
[381] Hearing, contemplating, meditating,
[382] View, conduct, meditation,
[383] Giving, ethics, patience,
[384] Effort, concentration, wisdom,
[385] Power, aspiration, wisdom,
[386] Likewise the perfection of method,
[387] The conduct of ten virtues, and so forth,
[388] Method and wisdom themselves, and
[389] Thus, from and so forth,
