[2506] By fixing the mind upon letters, orbs of light, or mandalas of sun and moon—rising ever higher until they sink into space, becoming invisible—an experience arises of emptiness utterly free from conceptual mind.

[2507] By placing the mind within the ear and holding it thus, simultaneous and one-pointed, arises the experience of sound-meditation.

[2508] By holding the mind upon the subtle divine form within the heart, arises the pure clear-light experience. Thus the bardo clear-light matures, and the divine form, ring-sel, and rainbow lights manifest.

[2509] Third: the seven sets demonstrating the seeing of dharmata.

[2510] Holding the mind upon gradual emptiness:

[2511] First, cool the body's many parts.

[2512] Analyze them with many names and so forth.

[2513] Upon the head alone, cool with many names.

[2514] When those names are examined for meaning and the meaning dissolves into atoms, seek where the name abides—

[2515] When not found, within that state where nothing moves in the mind—emptiness displayed in the depths—without searching, anger, remembrance or thought, place simultaneously. An experience of emptiness without duality arises.

[2516] Apply to all appearances exactly as the body is.

[2517] Holding the mind upon instantaneous emptiness:

[2518] Whatever appears, when intensely viewed, think "emptiness cleared, cleared, cleared away."

[2519] Train upon all form-appearances, sound-appearances, and so forth. An experience like placing upon a mirror arises.

[2520] Holding the mind upon impermanence: training appearances to be without fixation.

[2521] Whatever appears without fixation, without truth—appearing variously, thus not true—becoming without boundary, through impermanence—thinking thus and training—

[2522] Arises the experience of separation from planetary fixation.

[2523] Upon whatever appears of the five elements, awareness just-big, placed without distraction—

[2524] Liberation in that very place—experience like a dream arises.

[2525] Holding the mind upon non-thought: appearances whatever appears, awareness whatever becomes—the moment's continuum without parts—thought-free—primordially abides—recognizing that, gathering, reaching, training—arises great thought-free self-abiding meditation.

[2526] Holding the mind upon union.
