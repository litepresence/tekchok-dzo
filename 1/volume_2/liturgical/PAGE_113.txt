[4954] Inner: dharmata field main-point;
[4955] Dawn cause: gate main-point;
[4956] Wind abiding: three main-points clear path,
[4957] Secret: habituation measure sequence,
[4958] Ripen: sign sequence,
[4959] Ultimate end: exhaust sequence,
[4960] And take measure with three,
[4961] Supreme vision.
[4962] Ripen: point;
[4963] Complete: body and three fruit complete cause;
[4964] Three group: four determine,
[4965] Therefore called three.
[4966] Or: dharmata three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing,
[4967] Self-resonance vision three,
[4968] Outer dawn number;
[4969] Dharmakaya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;
[4970] Sambhogakaya self-resonance: light five outer clear,
[4971] Wisdom self-clear;
[4972] Nirmanakaya self-resonance: dawn liberation,
[4973] Equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,
[4974] Rely therefore called three.
[4975] That also: base three establish base,
[4976] Entity not-existing difference main-point,
[4977] And path three clear obstacle,
[4978] Path not-existing near far,
[4979] And measure three deliver measure,
[4980] Not-existing similar different random,
[4981] And fruit three exhaust end deliver,
[4982] Not-existing yes-no doubt,
[4983] Therefore called direct.  Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity,  Dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;  Guru instruction experience take time:  Direct see three—dhatu, awareness, dharmas.  Dharmata direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;  Habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision,  See three-bodies' light point;  Measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure;  Main-point: dharmata self-exhaust.  Thus: three enumeration place other rely,  Determine simultaneous liberate fruit.  Vision: whatever dawn, dharmata dawn;  Field: whatever dawn, dhatu dawn;  Manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house,  Awareness hanging-cord with dawn.  Buddha: not-seeing with stone,  Fruit: take that vision experience.  Thus: dharmata direct vision essence—  Dhatu awareness luminous-clear vision.
