[5717] Through pressing Sambhogakaya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.
[5718] Through pressing Nirmanakaya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.

[5719] Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:

[5720] From the Mu tig phreng ba:

[5721] "The door is that itself unmoving."

[5723] Looking as Nirmanakaya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.
[5724] That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.
[5725] Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.
[5726] Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power.

[5727] Looking as Sambhogakaya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.
[5728] Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,
[5729] All delusion ceases in one time.
[5730] Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmata.
[5731] Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness.
[5732] Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.

[5733] Looking as Dharmakaya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.
[5734] Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.
[5735] Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.
[5736] Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness.

[5737] Eye relaxation is the same for all.

[5738] Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:
[5739] Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.
[5740] Bending all finger joints destroys body action.
[5741] Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner.
[5742] Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.

[5743] Second, the three unmoving of speech:
[5744] Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.
