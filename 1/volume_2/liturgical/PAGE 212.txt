[9103] Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[9104] Dharma-nature pure appearance, awareness, and
[9105] Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[9106] Again conducting Dharma-nature cease-appearance.
[9107] From Thalgyur:
[9108] Wisdom-perfect appearance and
[9109] From Dharma-nature first appearance,
[9110] From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.
[9111] Thus it is spoken, and:
[9112] At this time, body-speech-mind measures;
[9113] When seeing individual appearances,
[9114] Signs complete by ripening in self,
[9115] Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
[9116] Thus it is spoken.

[9117] Thus by taking experience, supreme effort ones: three years;
[9118] Middle ones: five years;
[9119] Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[9120] Six days: seeing Dharma-nature cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.
[9121] From that same source:
[9122] By great-small effort in this,
[9123] By days, months, years,
[9124] Certainly accomplish at individual times,
[9125] From times without much moving,
[9126] Reach individual measures.
[9127] Thus it is spoken.

[9128] This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking.
[9129] Third, determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[9130] Gathering sense-organs to essential point of continuum, closing memory's door;
[9131] Putting knowable objects in vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly;
[9132] At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place;
[9133] Striking with vast appearance by day,
[9134] Suppressing all signs.
[9135] Though these were explained formerly,
[9136] Here also explained as leap-over companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[9137] There is distinction slightly different from former.
[9138] Daytime, looking at manifest by elephant-gaze,
[9139] Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[9140] Nighttime, placing cognition on bindu-empty lamp;
[9141] When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion;
[9142] When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle, in the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.
