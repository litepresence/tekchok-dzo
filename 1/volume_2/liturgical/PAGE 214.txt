[9209] The samadhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.

[9210] Third, extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:
[9211] Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[9212] Extensively explaining the nature,
[9213] Summarizing the meaning by aspect.

[9214] First:
[9215] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[9216] Also, what are the five intentions?
[9217] By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
[9218] By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground.
[9219] By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
[9220] By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.
[9221] By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.

[9222] Second, from five:
[9223] First, the essence of mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of great perfect nature, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[9224] When realizing that by sense-power,
[9225] When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for best, middle, and last three sense-powers of the person, thus twelve portions.

[9226] From Power-Perfect:
[9227] At the time when mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[9228] Reach the end of great perfect view.
[9229] For best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three views arise.
[9230] For best sense-power, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising
[9231] Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[9232] At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean.
[9233] Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting sky-spear.
[9234] Fruit is seeing appearance of birthless self-arising.
[9235] The view of middle sense-power
[9236] Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[9237] Intention is free from concept portions, like flags attaching to ocean.
[9238] Conduct is unblocked spontaneous, like mad-one.
