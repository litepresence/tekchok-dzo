[11412] Through remaining for a moment in the arising of spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance,
[11413] Upon completing twenty-one days of samādhi,
[11414] Through the gate of impure own-appearance, saṃsāra appears as the six classes of beings.
[11415] Through the gate of purity, the emanation kāya emanates, taming whatever and benefiting.
[11416] Like illusion benefiting illusion,
[11417] Own-appearance benefits through own-appearance.
[11418] What need for liberation before emanating emanations?
[11419] For if self is not liberated, since self-benefit is not complete, there is no occasion for other-benefit to arise.
[11420] That emanation is only like a shooting star running,
[11421] Explained as uncertain regarding long or short duration.
[11422] Confusing able and unable to emit emanations,
[11423] Many focus their minds on whether buddhas can or cannot benefit others.
[11424] This is a great error.
[11425] Buddhas that do not benefit are not desired in the Great Vehicle and are impossible in reality.
[11426] Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent penetration, where spontaneously accomplished doors of the bardo arise without delay, have no emanations,
[11427] For the impure field of emanation does not appear at that time.
[11428] From the spontaneously accomplished door appearing, the impure appears.
[11429] If emanation does not benefit there,
[11430] Since the appearance of saṃsāra has not set, to complete the incomplete buddha activity of own-appearance, emanation appears to open.
[11431] Having benefited through that, emptying saṃsāra, again that emanation appearance goes to the ground of primordial purity, dissolving within the eight spontaneously accomplished doors.
[11432] That primordially pure ground, beyond appearing and not appearing, is without actual difference of individual three kāyas from merely the basis of arising of the three kāyas.
[11433] From that, know the way other-benefit arises again in ground-appearance.
[11434] This place is the supreme difficulty, the great secret vajra seal.
[11435] If from now on one arises who can speak without error, know it to be through my power.
[11436] Second, the extensive explanation of relics has three parts.
