Some at only stopping cough, likewise some completely running, some old and some young, some dying after descending into youth—in that, thus "this human is young," what pride-confidence of the alive?

Thus thinking certain quick death by impermanence: this life's activity—attachment-aversion, fight-quarrel, laziness, hoard-store, great year-wish difference, faction side-grasp, enemy-friend subdue-protect, hearing yet word-explain not fitting meaning, and all friends—what benefit? Thus must think from heart. To do speech:

Life duration short, knowable forms many;
Life's extent also not known how much;
Like goose taking milk from water,
Do accept self's desire.

Thus: from today, need effort in profound dharma. That too, also looking at outer object's appearance, continuous impermanent by sun-moon-time-four change; moment impermanent by day-night moment change; nature impermanent by thinking birth-death sequence-row; thinking on gathered-yet-separate like shop traveler; quickly die, certainly die, when die opportunity not exist, thus thinking dharma-not-by benefit not exist.

Inner self's illusion-body youth, mind's arise-door, pleasure-pain sequence-rows changing before-after, thus also thinking impermanent, not-stable, changing, transferring, as not having example of returning after death. Thinking death only without being distracted moment-instant.

From Conduct Entrance:

Day and night all in, by self,
Appropriate to think this only—thus.

That too, meditating samadhi in interval of mind not turned from this life, and though putting other dharma exercise of doing, need to think this only from heart, for no dharma more profound than this for turning mind from samsara.

From the presence of Master Great Padma also...
