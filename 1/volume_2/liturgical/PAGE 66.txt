[3116] By this, confusion is made into the path.

[3117] Thus it is.

[3118] Third, the illusory body: making appearance-existence into the yoga of illusion.

[3119] Herein, daytime training of the illusory body upon reflection, and.

[3120] Nighttime training of the illusory body in dream—two aspects.

[3121] First: appearance of reflection arising in mirror, and.

[3122] Upon these outer-inner phenomena difference not existing.

[3123] Holding as true—what use?

[3124] All are illusion-reflection appearance—knowing this with non-distracted aspiration, meditate whatever appears as illusion-reflection, and.

[3125] Especially upon one's own form appearing in mirror.

[3126] Putting on clothes, and.

[3127] Putting ornaments, and.

[3128] Removing those, throwing outside, and.

[3129] Praising, and.

[3130] Disparaging, etcetera—doing these.

[3131] Though that form appears there, like meaning not established.

[3132] Upon this appearance—self-other.

[3133] Enemy-friend.

[3134] Food-clothing.

[3135] Enjoyment.

[3136] Pleasant-unpleasant.

[3137] Denial-affirmation.

[3138] Birth-death.

[3139] Happiness-suffering.

[3140] Sickness-pain.

[3141] Whatever arises, remembers, appears—all samsara-nirvana phenomena like reflections inside mirror, knowing essence not existent from time of appearance itself.

[3142] Mastering deluded-appearance truthless illusion-nature.

[3143] Seeing own body also as illusion-body, without doubt holding bardo illusory-body.

[3144] As said in the Ljonpa-asked Sutra:

[3145] Upon completely pure mirror-mandala.

[3146] Like face-reflection appearing.

[3147] How nature not established.

[3148] Ljonpa, know phenomena.

[3149] Thus said, and.

[3150] From Arya Samadhiraja Sutra:

[3151] How night-water-moon.

[3152] Though appearing in clear defilement-not-exist lake.

[3153] Water-moon empty hollow essence not exist.

[3154] Phenomena all thus know do.

[3155] How people many midst.

[3156] Illusionist by forms emanate and.

[3157] Horse elephant chariot various make.

[3158] Like various appearance not-true upon that.

[3159] Phenomena all thus know do.

[3160] How water-field moist tree.
