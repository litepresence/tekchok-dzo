From that one's following, learning might arise; therefore these are explained for turning back. As proclaimed in the Blazing Reliquary Signs Tantra:

Thus for all sentient beings,
When the life-formations are enacted,
By the sky's own characteristic
All these exercise in birth-places.
Whoever dies, at that time
The sky turns gloomy-black, darkness black,
Likewise rain and steam and wind,
Hail and dust-whirlwinds arise—
To whoever these befall,
Without intermediate state,
They become in hell's birth-place,
O dakini.

Sky like mist, light yellow,
Sun and moon die,
Without wind and dust,
Yellow mist, sun not visible,
Rain or traces, or at twilight
These will fall—thus to whoever
These befall, in hungry ghost
Birth-place they are born, O dakini.

Sky gloomy without wind,
Clouds black without gaps,
Or mist appears,
Gloomy joyless—whoever
Does the life-formation,
This is the animal place.

Greatly fierce, disturbed by wind,
Clouds black-massed, fearful forms,
Greatly disturbed with coming-going,
Thunder and lightning's tongue protrude,
Sun and moon unable to be seen—
Thus to whoever these befall,
This is the asura birth-place.

Sky clear and pure,
Sun and moon's appearance clear,
Wind and dust unable to rise,
This is the god's birth-place.

Also in clear pure sky,
Undivided clouds like white silk,
Greatly thin, thread-like appear,
Or sun and moon with light-housed—
Thus to whoever these befall,
This human birth-place is obtained.

Thus whoever possesses signs,
Is certainly of the six races;
Formations without such signs
Are signless and uncertain.
Thus all those signs
Come from two to three days,
These are signs of birth there
In that birth-place—thus proclaimed.

Even those who die without signs—where they take birth is known by their own karma.
