[6522] Cutting that, mind's ease without failure to realize from non-existent mind's meaning.

[6523] Moreover, dharmata before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6524] Recognizing no birth in mind.
[6525] Knowing that, faith that propensities are not harmed by body's all-ground.
[6526] Believing that, deciding mind's birth impossible now.
[6527] Through that dharma, mind's ease without returning place and returning-support, mind's house ceasing.

[6528] Thus, through grasping the measure of four times of mind-searching,
[6529] Buddha not existing, buddha also not even name-only.
[6530] Mind turning from holding hope for results.

[6531] That turning, no dharmas making path effort-exertion.

[6532] Thus, non-existent dharma having nothing, called "liberation's measure" through not finding meaning from mere names designated as samsara-nirvana.

[6533] Therefore, mind itself non-existent having nothing,
[6534] Mind having no cause-reason, not seen,
[6535] Thus turning four face-introducings of non-existence, and
[6536] Realizing sixteen dharma-possessors
[6537] Is destroying mind's house.

[6538] Like child's house built and destroyed;
[6539] Like that: action destroys action, iron destroys iron;
[6540] Impermanent destroys impermanent, like illusion-person destroys illusion-city;
[6541] Made destroys impermanent, like corpse stacked on corpse;
[6542] Impermanent destroys made, like present wisdom destroys former ignorance.

[6543] Thus, mind destroying mind, both dissolve without track, like letters written on water;
[6544] Not-exist seeking not-exist also not finding, like no finding-place though searching for wish-fulfilling jewel not existing in poor house.

[6545] Non-existent mind having no place to destroy
[6546] Is like no holding-place in water when dissolving.

[6547] Therefore, not knowing non-existent mind's meaning,
[6548] Searching mind for view-meditation-conduct
