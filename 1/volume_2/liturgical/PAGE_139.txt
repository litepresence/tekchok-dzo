[5873] [5873] Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;
[5874] [5874] Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into samsara of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;
[5875] [5875] Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvana's self-place.
[5876] [5876] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[5877] [5877] Through four great confidences of unchanging view,
[5878] [5878] Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.
[5879] [5880] Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
[5880] [5881] Concluding gathering through sixteen visions:
[5881] [5882] Vision,
[5882] [5883] Increase,
[5883] [5884] Obtain,
[5884] [5885] Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,
[5885] [5886] Completing the sixteen-ground vision:
[5886] [5887] Dharmata manifest vision: increase is eye;
[5887] [5888] Near increase: eye's that itself;
[5888] [5889] Obtain: seeing nadi;
[5889] [5890] Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.
[5890] [5891] Experience increase vision: increase is light;
[5891] [5892] Near increase: bindu;
[5892] [5893] Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;
[5893] [5894] Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.
[5894] [5895] Measure-arrive vision: increase is body;
[5895] [5896] Near increase: vision as father-mother;
[5896] [5897] Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;
[5897] [5898] Near obtain: mandala complete.
[5898] [5899] Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in body and wisdom;
[5899] [5900] Near increase: empty without focus;
[5900] [5901] Obtain: inexpressible;
[5901] [5902] Near obtain: dharmata not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.
[5902] [5903] Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions, having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,
[5903] [5904] Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."
[5904] [5905] Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result, complete here in freeing as light-body and
[5905] [5906] Freeing in the bardo.
