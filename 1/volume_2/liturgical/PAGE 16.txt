[807] Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[808] Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[809] Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[810] Moreover from that same nature:
[811] Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] This is dharmakaya's conduct.
[813] Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] This is dharmakaya's meditation.
[815] Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] This is dharmakaya's view.
[817] Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] This is dharmakaya's fruition.
[819] Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] This is dharmakaya's enlightened activity.
[821] One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] These are dharmakaya's excellence-qualities.
[823] Thus it is spoken.
[824] Second: Sambhogakaya's basis—five expansive explanations:
[825] Essence,
[826] Definitive meaning,
[827] Characteristics,
[828] Appearance mode,
[829] Abiding mode—thus.
[830] First: Essence—from Rangshar:
[832] Birth exists, yet death-free, possessing vajra,
[833] Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear,
[834] Possessing five fathers, five fields, five clusters,
[835] Possessing five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations,
[836] Possessing five bases, five paths, five fruitions,
[837] Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[838] This is sambhogakaya's complete essence.
[839] Thus it is spoken.
[840] Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[841] In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered.
[843] From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[844] Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[845] Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[846] In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear.
[847] Thus it is spoken.
[848] Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, green.
[853] Five kayas:
[854] Essence-expanse kaya,
[855] Unchanging vajra-kaya,
[856] Dharmakaya,
[857] Sambhogakaya,
[858] Nirmanakaya—five.
[859] Five fathers:
[860] Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.
