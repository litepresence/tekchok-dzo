[807] Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition
[808] Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity
[809] Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed
[810] Moreover from that very source

[811] Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] This is conduct of Dharmakaya
[813] Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] This is meditation of Dharmakaya
[815] Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] This is view of Dharmakaya
[817] Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] This is fruition of Dharmakaya
[819] Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] This is enlightened activity of Dharmakaya
[821] One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] These are excellence-qualities of Dharmakaya
[823] Thus it is spoken

[824] Second, the extensive explanation of Sambhogakaya's basis: five aspects
[825] Essence
[826] Definitive meaning
[827] Characteristics
[828] Mode of appearance
[829] Mode of abiding—thus

[830] First, essence—from Rangshar:
[832] Birth exists, yet death-free, possessing vajra
[833] Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear
[834] Five fathers, five fields, five clusters possessing
[835] Five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations possessing
[836] Five bases, five paths, five fruitions possessing
[837] Five abodes, five fields, five essences possessing—
[838] The essence of Sambhogakaya complete

[840] Though expressed as birth from the aspect of arising as self-appearance from expanse,
[841] In meaning birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free, for the demon of death is conquered

[843] From within the interior-free, the precious jewel treasury emerges—
[844] Arisen wisdom transcends all arising
[845] Realizing wisdom transforms in meaning
[846] In vast kayas, outer and inner aspects clear

[848] Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, and green

[853] Five kayas:
[854] Essence-expanse kaya
[855] Unchanging vajra-kaya
[856] Dharmakaya
[857] Sambhogakaya
[858] Nirmanakaya—five

[859] Five fathers:
[860] Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi
