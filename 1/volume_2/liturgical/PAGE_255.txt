Thus when nirmanakaya signs exist, if desire, take miraculous birth in nature nirmanakaya field, dwell sixty-eight thousand years for beings' benefit, from that state emanate millions of four continents, do immeasurable benefit for beings, cross ground of primordially pure.

If think contradiction with nature emanation completing five hundred years—no contradiction. Though dwelling five hundred for self-benefit, dwelling limitless for other-benefit—no contradiction.

Also from that:

Thus possessing person,
After in nirmanakaya field,
Taking miraculously born body,
Dwelling sixty-eight thousand years,
This person does beings' benefit.
Then from essence nature,
In Jambudvipa etcetera continents,
By sixty thousand million emanations,
Taking suitable bodies,
Does beings' benefit—
This becomes, dakini.
Then to essence primordially pure,
Like sun rays gathering,
Own emanation with,
Self-dissolves into own essence,
Becomes without difference, without distinction.
As water dissolves in water,
Likewise butter in butter,
As sky dissolves in sky,
Essence becomes without identification.

Inner awareness experience:
From Self-Arisen:
Possessing that joy,
Without attachment to worldly,
All appearance arising as light,
Seeing kaya mass not ceasing in light,
Body joy without grasping,
Awareness one-pointed,
Awareness naturally slow,
Awareness not distracted,
Awareness not entering other,
Realizing awareness as not anything,
Awareness not changing,
Awareness clear without ceasing,
Awareness ceasing without thought,
