Gaze awareness at sky empty—
Field compatible with sky, experience empty,
Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.

From Mind Section:
Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.

Thus said, and:
From Collection:
Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.

Thus said, and:
From Middle Mother:
Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.

That also: field outer-inner mixed,
Called equal limitless view;
Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
Called dhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana taste equal view.

This same, from Instruction-Child also:
Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.

Thus spoken.

Third, wind-awareness main-point:
When field and gate two meet,
Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
That also: somehow slow wind,
Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.

That also: wind and slow cause—
Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper;
Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
Actual: make buddha, not seeing contaminated.

That thus, also from Thalgyur:
Make wind somehow slow,
Arising from fully projecting,
Body and mind connection cut that,
Not reversing even in three realms.

Thus said, and:
Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom,
Arising from fully projecting,
Body and mind connection cut that,
Not reversing even in three realms.

Thus said, and:
Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom.

Thus it was said.

Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.
