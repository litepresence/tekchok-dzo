[5745] Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom.
[5746] Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.

[5747] Third, the three unmoving of mind:
[5748] Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.
[5749] Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.
[5750] Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure.

[5751] That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—
[5752] The vital that frees from those.

[5753] Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:
[5754] Through three body abidings, separation from action;
[5755] Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising;
[5756] Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.

[5757] First three:
[5758] Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase samsara's delusion.
[5759] Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.
[5760] Placing action at the basis, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening.

[5761] Second three:
[5762] Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.
[5763] Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.
[5764] Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two.

[5765] Third, three vision abidings:
[5766] Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.
[5767] Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.
[5768] Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.

[5769] At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:
[5770] Arises through obtaining certainty at the basis of four powers.
[5771] Speech four measures arriving:
[5772] Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.
[5773] Mind four measures arriving:
