Therefore, one who enters the door of Secret Mantra and breaks the great samaya toward the vajra guru dwells long with great suffering. As proclaimed in the Tantra of the Supreme Samaya Establishment:

Whoever toward the vajra guru
With evil mind does disparage,
Greatly breaking from the samaya,
For as long as from the great ocean
Each single hair-strand might cast forth
Water till that be exhausted—
For kalpas numbering that ocean
Such a one will there remain:
This is renowned as Vajra Hell.

Second, the sign of birth as a hungry ghost: at the time of death, the sky becomes unclear with light-rays spreading like the appearance of the western direction, the sun and moon die, yellow clouds obscure sun and moon, rain falls followed by cold, or rain falls at twilight. These are the signs of birth among hungry ghosts with outer obscurations, inner obscurations, sudden obscurations, particular obscurations, obscurations gone to error, obscurations of karma and karmic arrangements, and obscurations where the enjoyment of appearances does not come under one's power.

Third, the sign of animals: at the time of transferring life, the sky is gloomy without warmth's oil, gathered with black clouds, or gloomy with rising mist, or valleys tinged blue with smoke-forms. When a gloomy, joyless sky arises, one takes birth among the many-legged animals, the legless, four-legged, winged, clawed, and so forth.
