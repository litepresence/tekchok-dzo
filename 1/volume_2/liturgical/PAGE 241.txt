[10385] Again from that same source:
[10386] Whatever being in whose mind possesses these signs,
[10387] Toward the buddha's kaya, speech, and mind also,
[10388] By this I teach familiarity.
[10389] Unlearned meditation self-descends,
[10390] And the mind obtains ease by its nature.
[10391] By this, previously familiar with the kaya,
[10392] Dharmas appear to the mind through thought,
[10393] And seeing objects not seen before,
[10394] Words of dharma not heard before
[10395] Are known as the nature.
[10396] By this, previously familiar
[10397] With the buddha's speech, O Dakini.
[10398] Always dwelling alone,
[10399] Without fearful mind toward anything,
[10400] The person roaming mountains and forests—
[10401] By this, previously also familiar
[10402] With the mind, O Dakini.
[10403] Such a person possessing these,
[10404] If practicing truth without gap,
[10405] Without obstacle in three lives
[10406] Will doubtlessly attain buddhahood.
[10407] Thus it is said.
[10408] These signs, primordially abiding in body, speech, and mind by nature, are clearly sent through familiarity in previous lives.
[10409] Not having reached the end of that very thing,
[10410] Having become an obstacle, they arise in this life.
[10411] Here also, if without effort, it is called uncertain,
[10412] Entering other existences through the power of different karma.
[10413] These signs, through familiarity with mind apprehending and holding meaning, arise in many beings—birds, wild animals,
[10414] Dogs, horses, and so forth—through training the white kaya, speech, and mind in previous lives.
[10415] Born into lower existence beings through black karma,
[10416] From later on depending on present actions,
[10417] Practicing the supreme truth dharma in the present is essential.
[10418] Again from that:
[10419] Thus in family and not family,
[10420] By the force of previous familiarity,
[10421] These signs arise in the body.
[10422] Birds, wild animals, dogs, and so forth,
[10423] In apprehending animal forms,
[10424] These signs arise.
[10425] Previously trained, now obstacles.
[10426] Thus it is said.
[10427] Second meaning: explaining particular signs of those who have entered the path in the present, in two parts:
