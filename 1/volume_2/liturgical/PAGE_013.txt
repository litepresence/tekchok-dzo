[636] Together with all bones,
[637] Together with all blood,
[638] Together with all lymph,
[639] Abiding within two eyes, moistening without essence-holding.
[640] Fifth, the five spaces:
[641] Again, from Self-Arisen it is taught:
[642] The five spaces are:
[643] All-common-pervading space,
[644] Object-free clear-tone space,
[645] Pure unmixed space,
[646] Meaning-indicating space,
[647] Pure-field liberating space—thus.
[648] These also, in sequence,
[649] Together with actual awareness,
[650] Together with five lights,
[651] Together with pure-expanse lamp,
[652] Together with signs' wisdom,
[653] Together with twenty-one pointing-out instructions, example-meaning certain confidence.
[654] Thus, five elements' awareness summarized attributes are the great elements,
[655] While their basis is the small elements.
[656] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[657] The fifteenth division: Showing the Elements' Place.
[658] Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[659] Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[660] Basis: kayas,
[661] Tone: light,
[662] Supported: wisdom,
[663] Activities: enlightened actions.
[664] First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[665] Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[666] Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[667] The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[668] Place extensive explanation.
[669] The first is:
[670] Though essence is one, three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects—
[671] From Self-Arisen:
[672] Three kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] Without obstruction to anything,
[674] Perceived objects being one,
[675] Essence appearing individually.
[676] Thus it is said.
[677] This is awareness-itself's appearance manner:
[678] From that same source:
[679] Thought-free awareness is dharmakaya's essence,
[680] Uncensored clear awareness is sambhogakaya,
[681] Whatever-appearing awareness is nirmanakaya.
[682] Thus it is said.
[683] In this, complete,
[684] Awakened.
