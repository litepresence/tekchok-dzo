[5830] [5830] Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.
[5831] [5831] This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.
[5832] [5832] Moreover, body's basis, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[5833] [5833] Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.
[5834] [5834] Speech four: express basis,
[5835] [5835] Express condition,
[5836] [5836] Express object,
[5837] [5837] Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[5838] [5838] Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.
[5839] [5839] Mind four:
[5840] [5840] Memory,
[5841] [5841] No memory,
[5842] [5842] Non-arising,
[5843] [5843] Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[5844] [5844] Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.
[5845] [5845] Thus, signs dawning in body,
[5846] [5846] Known in essence-speech,
[5847] [5847] Confidence correcting mind,
[5848] [5848] Measure caught by dream,
[5849] [5849] Through diligence sequence:
[5850] [5850] Great: completely ceasing dreams,
[5851] [5851] Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.
[5852] [5852] Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[5853] [5853] No conceptuality of good or bad latency.
[5854] [5854] Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.
[5855] [5855] Thus the three abidings:
[5856] [5856] From the Mu tig phreng:
[5857] [5857] Abiding is the pure expanse,
[5858] [5858] Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[5859] [5859] Abiding are all visions.
[5860] [5861] Third, striking nails with three obtains:
[5861] [5862] Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[5862] [5863] Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[5863] [5864] Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[5864] [5865] Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."
[5865] [5866] Again from that itself:
[5866] [5867] Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[5867] [5868] Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[5868] [5869] Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.
[5869] [5871] Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[5870] [5872] Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;
[5871] 
[5872]
