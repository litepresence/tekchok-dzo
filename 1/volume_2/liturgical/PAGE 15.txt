[751] Naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding—
[752] From that same nature:
[753] Fearless, empty, and clear,
[754] All actions complete—
[755] This is dharmakaya's definition.
[756] Thus it is said.
[757] Self-body is this:
[758] Freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere—
[759] From Self-Arising:
[760] Without outer, without inner, without within expanse—
[761] This is dharmakaya's self-body.
[762] Thus it is said.
[763] Metaphor is this:
[764] Like the sun through clear-light awareness;
[765] Like the ocean through depth;
[766] Like the lotus, unstained by defects;
[767] Like the mountain, unchanging;
[768] Like space, vast without boundary or center;
[769] Like the lion, possessing from primordial the confidence that surpasses all—
[770] From that same nature:
[771] Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] These are dharmakaya's metaphors.
[774] Thus it is said.
[775] Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] From Self-Arising:
[777] Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] This is dharmakaya's self-sign.
[779] Thus it is said.
[780] Appearance is like the empty-clarity of sky's expanse—
[781] From that same nature:
[782] Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] This is dharmakaya's appearance.
[784] Thus it is said.
[785] Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] From that:
[787] Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[788] This is dharmakaya's place.
[789] Thus it is said.
[790] Characteristic is this:
[791] Essence, nature, and compassion—three inseparable—
[792] From that same nature:
[793] Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] This is dharmakaya's characteristic.
[795] Thus it is said.
[796] Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[797] Adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] In great inseparability of expanse and awareness, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] From Self-Arising:
[800] Clear, luminous, and unmixed—three:
[801] This is dharmakaya's object.
[802] Thus it is said.
[803] Intent is this:
[804] View unsevered by direction or side,
[805] Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[806] Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
