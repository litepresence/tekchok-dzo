[751] Spontaneously accomplished nature, clear light kaya, great self-abiding—
[752] From that same source:
[753] Fearless, empty and clear,
[754] All actions complete—
[755] Dharmakaya's definition.
[756] Thus it is said.
[757] Self-body is:
[758] Separated from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere—
[759] From Self-Arising:
[760] Without outer, without inner, without in expanse—
[761] Dharmakaya's self-body.
[762] Thus it is said.
[763] Metaphor is:
[764] By clear light awareness, like the sun;
[765] By depth, like the ocean;
[766] Unstained by defects, like the lotus;
[767] Unchanging, like the mountain;
[768] Vast without boundary or center, like space;
[769] Possessing from primordial the confidence that surpasses all, like the lion—
[770] From that same source:
[771] Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] Dharmakaya's metaphors.
[774] Thus it is said.
[775] Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] From Self-Arising:
[777] Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] Dharmakaya's self-sign.
[779] Thus it is said.
[780] Appearance is like the empty-clear expanse of sky—
[781] From that same source:
[782] Cessation without, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] Dharmakaya's appearance.
[784] Thus it is said.
[785] Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] From that:
[787] Without extent, without object, without grasping—
[788] Dharmakaya's place.
[789] Thus it is said.
[790] Characteristic is:
[791] Essence, nature, and compassion—three inseparable—
[792] From that same source:
[793] Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] Dharmakaya's characteristic.
[795] Thus it is said.
[796] Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extreme cut,
[797] Adorned inside by five lights, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] In great inseparability of expanse and awareness, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] From Self-Arising:
[800] Clear, tone, and unmixed—three:
[801] Dharmakaya's object.
[802] Thus it is said.
[803] Intent is:
[804] View unsevered by direction or side,
[805] Meditation not established as entity or mark,
[806] Conduct transcending apprehending and grasping—
