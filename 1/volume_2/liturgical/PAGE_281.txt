[12142] First, cultivate the mind through hearing.
[12143] In the middle, decide through contemplation.
[12144] Finally, repeating with meditation, making the mind at ease is like approaching the box.
[12145] Like entering the box, settling meanings, entering at death without danger or fear.
[12146] The meanings of these were extensively shown before.
[12147] Here, explaining slightly in condensed practice:
[12148] Looking at outer appearance, seeing the appearing object like an illusory confusion mandala,
[12149] When seeing only the self-form of groundless emptiness,
[12150] All dharmas appearing variously as the mirror of view, meditation, and conduct have arisen from the beginning.
[12151] For it is the self-power of dharmatā's ceaseless play arising.
[12152] Also, looking at the various white and red appearing like eating under a garment house,
[12153] When seeing whatever appears, whatever arises, whatever is heard, all as the play of self-dissolved emptiness, without hand to correct or discard the blockage of appearance,
[12154] Appearance liberates from the ground of appearance, confusion liberates as groundless, arising only as the peak of illusion, liberated from saṃsāra of grasping outer objects.
[12155] The dharmas—pieces of mountains, excellent-born women, etc.—whatever first arises as appearing object, cut in pieces, put greatly wherever it appears,
[12156] Without entering the great consciousness as investigator,
[12157] Appearance is not changed by mind.
[12158] Mind is not seized by appearance; dissolve in self-place.
[12159] Without preventing the six consciousness groups, putting in self-place, dharmatā appearance arises spontaneously.
[12160] Thus looking at outer dharmas, when knowing as the self-form of objectless emptiness, grasping is pure like objectless space.
[12161] This is called realizing grasping as without nature.
[12162] Thus looking at the consciousness of the outer looker,
[12163] Moving dissolves in emptiness without outline,
[12164] When realizing as self-clear without sudden dissolving,
[12165] Realizing inner dharmatā as great without birth, cessation, or ground,
[12166] Grasping spreads as self-dissolved in the nature of supportless sky-like state.
[12167] In supportless ye re.
