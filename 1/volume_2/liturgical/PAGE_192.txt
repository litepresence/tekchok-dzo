[8165] [8165-8167]
[8166] The wheel of dharmatā's three crucial points,
[8167] The wheel of day-night luminosity,
[8168] The vast wheel of face-expanse wisdom—
[8169] Thus the three wheels turn.
[8170] [8168-8173]
[8171] Four divisions present the first:
[8172] Body's three settling points,
[8173] Gate's three seeing points,
[8174] Expanse's three guiding points,
[8175] Object's three appearance points.
[8176] [8174-8176]
[8177] First: Body's posture, whichever three held,
[8178] Stomach relaxed, nerve-wind ease abiding—
[8179] This purpose exists.
[8180] If deliberately held, wind wrong, spread arise,
[8181] Nerve twist tight—the cause.
[8182] [8177-8184]
[8183] Gaze held, wind essence very slow,
[8184] From outer held, nose drawn—
[8185] This particular dharma, great gathering.
[8186] Common method: nose out-inhale,
[8187] Wheel four's inside filled,
[8188] Mind clear-clear, meditation produced.
[8189] Wind wrong, spread, coil, dull—
[8190] Four obstacles arise,
[8191] Delusion-appearance not appearing.
[8192] Here: wind purified, increase path not made.
