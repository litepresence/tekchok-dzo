[445] Wind and
[446] Fire and
[447] Earth and
[448] Water and
[449] Extensive explanation of the nature of space.
[450] First among these, from two:
[451] Extensive explanation of root division and
[452] Extensive explanation of branch division.
[453] Root division:
[454] From the Self-Arisen:
[455] What are the five types of wind?
[456] Life-holding wind and
[457] Wind producing color and radiance and
[458] Fire-equal wind and
[459] All-pervading wind and
[460] Wind of karma without compassion—five.
[461] Those winds abide in the head and tail of all sentient beings' bodies. Thus.
[462] That also: life-holding wind abides in the life channel;
[463] Color and radiance producing abides in the chest;
[464] Fire-equal abides in the navel;
[465] All-pervading abides, pervading the whole body;
[466] Karma wind abides between heart and heart-membrane.
[467] Their functions also:
[468] Abiding of life and
[469] Producing radiance and
[470] Digesting food,
[471] Going and sitting, and
[472] Performing the function of life-transference—thus in sequence.
[473] Second, branch division:
[474] From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[475] First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen:
[476] In the life-holding wind also five:
[477] Root-holding life and
[478] Protecting life and
[479] Spreading life and
[480] Impure life and
[481] Shattering life—five. Thus.
[482] Those also according to sequence:
[483] Producing awareness potential and
[484] Producing bindhu potential and
[485] Producing light potential and
[486] Holding the root of non-awareness and
[487] Existing in the life channel in the manner of making mind's helper.
[488] Life wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness potential.
[489] Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[490] Again from that:
[491] In the wind abiding together with fire also five:
[492] Wind separating clear from impure and
[493] Wind producing warmth and
[494] Wind of clear-change and
[495] Wind gathering distinctions and
[496] Wind making praise—five. Thus.
[497] Those also according to sequence:
