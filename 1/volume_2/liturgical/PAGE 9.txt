[445] Wind and
[446] Fire and
[447] Earth and
[448] Water and
[449] Extensive explanation of the nature of space.
[450] First among these, from two:
[451] Extensive explanation of root division and
[452] Extensive explanation of branch division.
[452] Root division:
[453] From the Self-Arising:
[454] What are the five types of wind?
[455] Life-holding wind and
[456] Wind producing color and radiance and
[457] Fire-equal wind and
[458] All-pervading wind and
[459] Compassionless kalpa karma wind—five.
[460] Those winds abide in the head and tail of all sentient beings' bodies. Thus.
[461] That also: life-holding wind abides in the life channel;
[462] Color and radiance producing abides in the chest;
[463] Fire-equal abides in the navel;
[464] All-pervading abides pervading the whole body;
[465] Karma wind abides between heart and heart-membrane.
[466] Their functions also:
[467] Abiding of life and
[468] Producing radiance and
[469] Digesting food,
[470] Going and sitting, and
[471] Performing the function of life-transference—thus in sequence.
[472] Second, branch division:
[473] From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[474] First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arising:
[475] In the life-holding wind also five:
[476] Root-holding life and
[477] Protecting life and
[478] Spreading life and
[479] Impure life and
[480] Shattering life—five. Thus.
[481] Those also according to sequence:
[482] Producing awareness potential and
[483] Producing bindhu potential and
[484] Producing light potential and
[485] Holding the root of non-awareness and
[486] Existing in the life channel in the manner of making mind's helper.
[487] Life wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness potential.
[488] Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[489] Again from that [source]:
[490] In the wind abiding together with fire also five:
[491] Wind separating clear from impure and
[492] Wind producing warmth and
[493] Wind of clear-change and
[494] Wind gathering distinctions and
[495] Wind making praise—five. Thus.
[496] Those also according to sequence:
