[445] Wind and
[446] Fire and
[447] Earth and
[448] Water and
[449] Space nature extensive explanation.
[450] First among these, from two:
[451] Root division extensive explanation and
[452] Branch division extensive explanation.
[453] Root division:
[454] From the Self-Arisen:
[455] What are the five wind types?
[456] Life-holding wind and
[457] Color-radiance producing wind and
[458] Fire-equal wind and
[459] All-pervading wind and
[460] Compassionless karma wind—five.
[461] Those winds abide in all beings' bodies' head and tail. Thus.
[462] That also: life-holding wind abides in life-channel;
[463] Color-radiance producing abides in chest;
[464] Fire-equal abides in navel;
[465] All-pervading abides, pervading whole body;
[466] Karma wind abides between heart and heart-membrane.
[467] Their functions also:
[468] Life-abiding and
[469] Radiance-producing and
[470] Food-digesting,
[471] Going-sitting, and
[472] Life-transference function performing—thus in sequence.
[473] Second, branch division:

[480] Impure life and
[481] Shattering life—five. Thus.
[482] Those also according to sequence:
[483] Awareness-potential producing and
[484] Bindhu-potential producing and
[485] Light-potential producing and
[486] Non-awareness root holding and
[487] Existing in life-channel in mind-helper making manner.
[488] Life-wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness-potential.
[489] Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[490] Again from that:
[491] In fire-abiding wind also five:
[492] Clear-impure separating wind and
[493] Warmth-producing wind and
[494] Clear-change wind and
[495] Distinctions-gathering wind and
[496] Praise-making wind—five. Thus.
[497] Those also according to sequence:
