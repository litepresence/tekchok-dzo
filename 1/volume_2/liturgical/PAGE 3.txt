[130] Water-characteristic moisture.
[131] Fire-characteristic warmth.
[132] Wind-characteristic movement.
[133] Space-characteristic openness and vastness.
[134] Fifth, the sequence of functions:
[135] From the Thalgyur:
[136] The sequence of functions of inner arising:
[137] Earth makes the support of the body;
[138] By producing, it is asserted to ripen as flesh.
[139] Water gathers the entire body;
[140] By producing, it is asserted to ripen as blood.
[141] Fire ripens the entire body;
[142] By producing, it is asserted to ripen as warmth.
[143] Wind lifts the entire body;
[144] By producing, it makes breath ripen.
[145] Thus.
[146] Sixth, the Dharma-nature:
[147] Though generally empty, here the Dharma-nature that holds its own characteristic, made authoritative as Dharma-nature:
[148] From the Self-Arising:
[149] The Dharma-nature of the five elements:
[150] The cause of elements is earth.
[151] The wisdom of elements is fire.
[152] The emanation of elements is wind.
[153] The master of elements is water.
[154] The Dharma-nature of elements is space.
[155] Thus.
[156] Seventh, applied meaning—from two:
[157] The application of meaning to the essence of the five elements:
[158] From That Very [Source]:
[159] The application of meaning to elements is thus:
[160] Within the nature of Dharmakaya, primordially pure,
[161] By essence without change, element earth also is.
[162] By awareness wisdom engaging meaning, element fire also is.
[163] By awareness wisdom gone without movement into dimension, element wind also is.
[164] By awareness wisdom gathering three cavities as one, element water also is.
[165] By wisdom dissolving into the manner of nondual empty-luminous, element space is.
[166] Thus.
[167] The application of meaning connecting individual meanings of five elements with inner awareness:
[168] From the Norbu Drathakod:
[169] The five outer elements are the common Dharma of self-continuum;
[170] By connecting all outer-appearing elements with self-awareness itself, they are the common Dharma.
[171] Divisions are thus:
[172] The characteristic of earth making solidity also
