[130] Water-characteristic: moisture.
[131] Fire-characteristic: warmth.
[132] Wind-characteristic: movement.
[133] Space-characteristic: openness and spaciousness.
[134] Fifth, the sequence of functions:
[135] From the Thalgyur:
[136] The sequence of functions of inner-arising:
[137] Earth makes the basis of the body;
[138] By producing, it is asserted to ripen as flesh.
[139] Water gathers the entire body;
[140] By producing, it is asserted to ripen as blood.
[141] Fire ripens the entire body;
[142] By producing, it is asserted to ripen as warmth.
[143] Wind lifts the entire body;
[144] By producing, it makes breath ripen.
[145] Thus.
[146] Sixth, the dharma-nature:
[147] Though generally empty, here the dharma-nature that holds its own characteristic, made authoritative as dharma-nature:
[148] From the Self-Arisen:
[149] The dharma-nature of the five arising:
[150] The cause of arising is earth.
[151] The wisdom of arising is fire.
[152] The emanation of arising is wind.
[153] The master of arising is water.
[154] The dharma-nature of arising is space.
[155] Thus.
[156] Seventh, the application of meaning—from two:
[157] The application of meaning to the essence of the five arising:
[158] From That Very:
[159] The application of meaning to arising is thus:
[160] Within the nature of dharma-body, primordially pure,
[161] By essence without change, arising earth also is.
[162] By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising fire also is.
[163] By awareness-wisdom gone without movement into dimension, arising wind also is.
[164] By awareness-wisdom gathering the three cavities as one, arising water also is.
[165] By wisdom dissolving into the manner of nondual empty-luminous, arising space is.
[166] Thus.
[167] The application of meaning connecting the individual meanings of the five arising with inner awareness:
[168] From the Norbu Drathakod:
[169] The five outer arising are the common dharma of self-continuum;
[170] By connecting all outer-appearing arising with self-awareness itself, they are the common dharma.
[171] The divisions are thus:
[172] The characteristic of earth, making solidity, also—
