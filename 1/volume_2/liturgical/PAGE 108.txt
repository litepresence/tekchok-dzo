From that same:
Self-face awareness hanging-cord,
Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.

Thus said, and:
From Instruction-Child:
Hanging-cord inside dhatu,
Arrange place, do not separate.

Thus it was said.

That also: relying on slow wind,
Action separate meaning arises in mind;
Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead,
Conceptuality source exhausted from;
Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.

Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—
Self-arisen awareness enters.

That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,
Do five-six days;
Then practice gate, only that much;
Then seek field, do six-seven days;
Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.

That: very purified, meditation knowing arises;
Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,
No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.
Various divinations arise near,
Therefore make pure those not gone thus.

That: general, when apply great guide,
Preliminary measure arrives,
Purify with diligence,
Actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises.

Actual main: hit point-delivery,
Direct delight, special arises.
Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut,
Knowing capable of maintaining experience practice,
Doubt and conceptuality end,
Purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma.

Second: introduce awareness self-face directly:
Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like,
With dhatu luminous-clear vision—
This, not-deluded buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance.
Look at state: all concept-doers pure,
Elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within—
Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent,
Meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.
