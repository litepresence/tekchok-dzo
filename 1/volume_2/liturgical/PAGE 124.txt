[5358] At the time of the two upper visions, wind is thrown outward and not held inward,
[5359] Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,
[5360] The body copper-shining,
[5361] The all-ground consciousness part clear-vivid like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.

[5362] Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision, body and mind separate and cut,
[5363] Accomplishing the great mandala, the supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.

[5364] Again from the Thal 'gyur:

[5365] At all times of such vision,
[5366] The cutting of body-mind connection,
[5367] From the contaminated exhausted body also,
[5368] The mind with clear characteristics arising outward,
[5369] Like a shooting star emitting,
[5370] Clearly seen in the realm of space.

[5371] At the first times of that itself,
[5372] From separation from wind also,
[5373] Through the action of pure wind, effortful,
[5374] Arising from throwing outward from the body.

[5375] From the part of the two see-agents also,
[5376] The body luminous and pure,
[5377] The mind like fire-sparks emitting,
[5378] Not abiding as one, self-clear basis,
[5379] Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.

[5380] Through this, having cut body-mind connection,
[5381] There is no returning to the three realms.

[5383] At this time, the see-agent also, like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the all-ground consciousness part,
[5384] Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,
[5385] Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.

[5386] At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,
[5387] For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmata.
[5388] This is called "completion of practice measure."

[5389] Fourth, the dharmata-exhausting vision has two parts:
[5390] Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and
[5391] Extensive explanation of nature.

[5392] First:

[5393] From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,
[5394] The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,
[5395] Like the moon waning from that,
[5396] Again that body fading until reaching the bindu, certain vision to the first mind.

[5397] That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions through the fourfold sequence of container-contents' arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.
