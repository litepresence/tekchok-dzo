[636] Together with all the bones,
[637] Together with all the blood,
[638] Together with all the lymph,
[639] Abiding within the two eyes, moistening without holding to essence.
[640] Fifth, the five spaces:
[641] Again, from Self-Arising it is taught:
[642] The five spaces are:
[643] The space pervading all in common,
[644] The space of clear tone without object,
[645] The pure unmixed space,
[646] The space indicating meaning,
[647] The space liberating into the pure field—thus.
[648] These also, in sequence,
[649] Together with actual awareness,
[650] Together with the five lights,
[651] Together with the lamp of pure expanse,
[652] Together with the wisdom of signs,
[653] Together with the twenty-one pointing-out instructions, certain confidence in example and meaning.
[654] Thus, the summarized attributes of the five elements' awareness are the great elements,
[655] While their basis is the small elements.
[656] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[657] The fifteenth division: Showing the Place of the Elements.
[658] Thus, having established the nature of the elements as the basis,
[659] Now, the fourfold purity of the supported: the expanse and wisdom:
[660] The basis: the kayas,
[661] The tone: the light,
[662] The supported: the wisdom,
[663] The activities: enlightened actions.
[664] First, the extensive division of the basis-kayas has two parts:
[665] The general presentation of the expanse of the three kayas, and
[666] The particular explanation of the enumeration of the five kayas.
[667] The first has: the brief presentation of the definition of kayas, and
[668] The extensive explanation of the place.
[669] The first is:
[670] Though essence is one, the three kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects—
[671] From Self-Arising:
[672] The three kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] Without obstruction to anything,
[674] Perceived objects being one,
[675] Essence appearing individually.
[676] Thus it is said.
[677] This is the way awareness itself appears:
[678] From that same source:
[679] Awareness without thought is the essence of dharmakaya,
[680] Awareness uncensored and clear is sambhogakaya,
[681] Awareness appearing as whatever is nirmanakaya.
[682] Thus it is said.
[683] In this, complete,
[684] Awakened.
