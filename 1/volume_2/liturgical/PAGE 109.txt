First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.
When this habituation arrives at measure—
Liberating with stone into light;
If not arrived, traverse bardo
Or nature-emanation field;
Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.

Thus introduce, and:
From Self-Arising Instruction:
Thus, whoever sees—this person,
First Samantabhadra,
Capacity itself is equal.

Thus said, and:
From Thalgyur:
Hanging-cord nature is:
By all conceptuality pure,
Base-buddha, not deluded.

Thus it was said.

Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:
Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
From first white-pure star-scatter like,
Point possessing five colors,
Each one,
Three-bind interval vision until that.

From previous:
Then see point.

Thus it was said.

That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
Inner conceptuality separate,
Equal limitless liberating;
Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance,
And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
Two—outer-inner pair connect;
Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.

Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:
Briefly show essence,
Extensively explain nature.

First: when all four visions,
Body abiding in posture,
Eye gazing at gaze manner,
Wind-awareness mode slow,
Three main-points harmonize.
Particularly: first two visions purify,
Later two not relying on effort,
Mode purify,
Liberate into luminous-clear,
Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual.

These main-points: arise from not doing—
Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.
Explain that meaning:
Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable,
Base-abide and that resonance,
From light channel pure vision,
Like golden thread coil,
Curve interval point bind.

Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings,
Essence not existing good-bad,
Equal, unchanging,
Place in abiding part.
