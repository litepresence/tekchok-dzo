[12168] Remaining in direct penetration,
[12169] Pervading without truth,
[12170] Fixed without root.
[12171] In the nature of the great equalness of dharmatā, smiling ge, put with joy.
[12172] There is need for the twist-nail of grasping mind to come out.
[12173] Thus when realizing object and mind as groundless and root-free,
[12174] The secret self-awareness of grasping-grasped, free from elaboration, goes to remaining.
[12175] When meditating in the nature of clear light without gathering or separating space-awareness through the four lamps of introduction by the master's word to the great self-clear primordial purity,
[12176] The five lights of outer space-appearance self-radiance are clear like form-reflections inside a mirror.
[12177] Though aspects appear outer, essence remains inner.
[12178] Knowing appearance-emptiness like water-moon form-reflections,
[12179] Do not do grasping attachment of joy-play in appearance.
[12180] Looking far in the clear light of outer appearance,
[12181] Inner awareness clear light clears near.
[12182] Awareness, free from meditation mind and antidote, wide view of pure vast nature,
[12183] Clear meditation of self-descended nature-remaining,
[12184] Without accepting or rejecting in clear light conduct,
[12185] Through obtaining the fruit of primordially pure self-clear,
[12186] Abandon delusion appearance without abandoning,
[12187] Block delusion thought without preventing,
[12188] Pure without training dual-grasping,
[12189] Pure from the beginning without abandoning faults,
[12190] Spontaneously accomplished qualities without seeking.
[12191] The meaning of complete liberation of the three realms,
[12192] Transcending the object of view,
[12193] Transcending the mind of meditation,
[12194] Transcending the calculation of conduct,
[12195] Transcending the Dharma of result,
[12196] In the fortune of emptying saṃsāra,
[12197] The field of dharmatā manifest appearance is spacious.
[12198] In the good circle of the land of the source of bliss,
[12199] Having obtained the self-arisen palace according to desire,
[12200] With the first lord, the King of Unchanging Light,
[12201] And the five-light spontaneously accomplished queen gathered,
[12202] The supreme inconceivable holy child-appearance meets his own father and mother.
[12203] It is called the time of obtaining the eternal establishment of inseparable joy-bliss.
[12204] The extensive scripture of these was shown before.
