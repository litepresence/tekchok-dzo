[8531] [8531] By direct placement in the first samadhi,
[8532] [8532] Through gradual familiarity with the three kayas,
[8533] [8533] In the yoga of the nature of entities,
[8534] [8534] This meaning becomes supremely near.
[8535] [8535] The samadhi experience of familiarity with the three kayas
[8536] [8536] Is not instantaneous arising—
[8537] [8537] All this is the gradual object of mind.
[8538] [8538] First, obtaining the nirmanakaya samadhi:
[8539] [8539] At that time, in one's own knowing,
[8540] [8540] All dharmas not seen before
[8541] [8541] Appear in the mind without thought.
[8542] [8542] The words of one's own pith instruction terms
[8543] [8543] Clear in the mind without being held.
[8544] [8544] For the person possessing good fortune,
[8545] [8545] The mind expanding by the taste of dharma,
[8546] [8546] For six or seven days the body
[8547] [8547] Does not feel what exists,
[8548] [8548] Rising above the earth,
[8549] [8549] The experience of going in mid-space
[8550] [8550] Arises as one's own activity field.
[8551] [8551] When awareness unfabricated is placed in the castle,
[8552] [8552] One obtains the nirmanakaya thus.
[8553] [8553] Passed that, by awareness unmoving,
[8554] [8554] The sambhogakaya itself also
[8555] [8555] In the continuum of one's own knowing,
[8556] [8556] Without all effort in self-appearance,
[8557] [8557] Arises thus as experienced taste.
[8558] [8558] Also the light appearances not seen before,
[8559] [8559] Who sees piece by piece—
[8560] [8560] This too trains toward the sambhogakaya.
[8561] [8561] For that yogi possessing fortune and family,
[8562] [8562] Each experience of self-clear knowing clears,
[8563] [8563] By familiarity with self-clear mind,
[8564] [8564] The inner clear, mind moving, is not cast outward,
[8565] [8565] Mind does not follow the traces of entities,
[8566] [8566] Worldly actions do not appear to mind.
[8567] [8567] By this one obtains the complete sambhogakaya.
[8568] [8568] Then, awareness in the sky,
[8569] [8569] By the view manner of great direct placement,
[8570] [8570] By equal placement without distraction,
[8571] [8571] Again the dharmakaya samadhi appears.
[8572] [8572] At that time, knowing clears from the depths,
[8573] [8573] Directly engaging like an infant,
[8574] [8574] This is the measure of increasing appearance.
[8575] [8575] By sharp and quick knowing,
[8576] [8576] One sees buddhas not seen before.
[8577] [8577] By this, at that time, people—
[8578] [8578] Hundreds of thousands of myriads appear to mind,
[8579] [8579] Crafts without knowing that the body's
[8580] [8580] Previous not-made actions,
[8581] [8581] All miracles and letters,
[8582] [8582] Signs, speech, and dependent arising,
[8583] [8583] Whatever was not seen before—
[8584] [8584] All this is experienced as taste,
[8585] [8585] Earth, water, fire, and wind.
