[57] The extensive explanation of outer arising, and
[58] The extensive explanation of inner arising.
[59] Of these, the first:
[60] Essence,
[61] Definitive terms,
[62] Purpose,
[63] Characteristics,
[64] Sequence of functions,
[65] Dharma-nature,
[66] Applied meaning,
[67] Manner of liberation,
[68] Divisions,
[69] The tenfold manner of completeness.
[70] First, the essence:
[71] Outer arising as visible form is the play of inner arising's actuality;
[72] Therefore, gathered within the inner domain, these are the five elements.
[73] From the Self-Arising:
[74] The outer elements are thus:
[75] Earth, water, fire,
[76] And likewise wind and space.
[77] Thus it is stated.
[78] The five forms of outer arising become the appearing container-support for sentient beings;
[79] The five actualities of inner arising become the support for mind and awareness.
[80] From the Thalgyur:
[81] The assertion regarding elements is thus:
[82] From particularities of general-common karma,
[83] By sentient beings' individual karma-supports,
[84] Relying upon the outer elements,
[85] Karma, sustenance, faculties,
[86] Entourage, and birth are asserted to be complete.
[87] Thus.
[88] Second, the definitive terms:
[89] From the Self-Arising:
[90] The definitive terminology of elements is thus:
[91] Not arisen through fabrication, spontaneously complete;
[92] By that which produces, they are elements;
[93] By pervading all migrators, they are great elements;
[94] By simultaneous birth, they are great elements;
[95] By existing in themselves, they are great elements;
[96] By being without change, they are great elements;
[97] By appearing harmoniously, they are great elements.
[98] The definitive terminology of great elements is likewise.
[99] Thus.
[100] Third, the purpose:
[101] From the Thalgyur:
[102] The inquiry into the purpose of elements is thus:
[103] Water gathers the clear essence and
[104] Separates the impurities—this is its function.
[105] As it acts within each individual body,
[106] Its purpose is known as heat and cold.
[107] Earth holds the foundation and
[108] Performs the functions of establishing and cohering.
[109] By ripening, it produces roots and so forth;
[110] Its purpose is known as the relative bindhu.
[111] Fire increases the elements and
[112] Performs the functions of ripening and clarifying.
[113] By blazing and spreading, it produces eyes and so forth;
[114] Its purpose is made known as warmth.
[115] Wind scatters and lifts and
[116] Performs the functions of moving and quivering.
[117] By moving and trembling, it holds the body;
[118] Its purpose is known as the abode of mind.
[119] The four elements, the great mandala of self,
[120] Become the cause for accomplishing body and so forth,
[121] Abide in the middle and perform the function of holding,
[122] And in the end perform all functions of destruction.
[123] Through one cause, the great elements
[124] Appear as the master who performs the various.
[125] Thus, regarding intention, self and other,
[126] Skilled in the meaning of completed action.
[127] Thus.
[128] Fourth, characteristics—from among five:
[129] Earth-characteristic solidity.
