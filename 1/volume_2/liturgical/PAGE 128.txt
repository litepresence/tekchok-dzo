[5516] Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—
[5517] That is a great error.
[5518] They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward.

[5519] If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;
[5520] Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future;
[5521] It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the basis of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse;
[5522] It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number.

[5523] Such faults are not suitable to accept.

[5524] Fifth, the boundary:

[5525] At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,
[5526] The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and
[5527] The boundary of inward return to outer vision.

[5528] Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time,
[5529] Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,
[5530] Outer visions and
[5531] The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,
[5532] From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,
[5533] Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,
[5534] The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,
[5535] Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel,
[5536] Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,
[5537] Awareness buddha-fied into dharmakaya, coiled.

[5538] If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action,
[5539] Moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.
