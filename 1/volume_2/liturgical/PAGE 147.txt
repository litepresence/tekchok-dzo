[6269] No holding of what is non-existent where;
[6270] No I, no possessions of I;
[6271] No expanse, no awareness body either;

[6273] No life, no reference to cut;
[6274] No collection, no field to accumulate;
[6275] No Buddha, no beings;
[6276] No abiding, no emptiness either.

[6278] From Samantabhadra's Mind Mirror:

[6279] To enlightenment essence without deviation or obstacle,
[6280] Where is holding deviation and obstacle?
[6281] Completely non-existent: deviation-free obstacles.
[6282] To dharmakaya separate from obstacles,
[6283] Holding deviation-obstacle as two is afflicted.

[6284] To unborn dharmakaya arising from self,
[6285] Capability-delusion of hoping to come from other.

[6286] To unborn awareness separate from thought,
[6287] Oh wonder, shown in words and letters!

[6289] From the Yi ge med pa:

[6290] Where is doer of unmade?
[6291] No lord of unfabricated fabrication;
[6292] Separate from view-doing dharmas of non-view;
[6293] Fully clear see-doer of non-seeing;
[6294] Separate from appear-direction of non-appear-doer;
[6295] Pervading ten directions, untouchable, of non-writing;
[6296] Separate from effort-accomplish dharmas of non-effort;
[6297] Separate from many dharmas of non-oneness;
[6298] Clear without outer-inner of non-outer-inner.

[6300] Also from the Common Secret Illusion:

[6301] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6302] Secret of all complete Buddhas!

[6304] Unborn from merely born.

[6305] E ma! Wonder of wonders, dharma!
[6306] Secret of all complete Buddhas!
