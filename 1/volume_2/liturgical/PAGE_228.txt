[9720] [9720] Thus it is spoken.
[9721] [9721] From Root Wisdom:
[9722] [9722] Like dream, like illusion,
[9723] [9723] Like gandharva city,
[9724] [9724] Like-that arising and like-that abiding,
[9725] [9725] Like-that also not destroyed. Thus it is spoken.
[9726] [9727] Appearing to mind whatever appears,
[9727] [9728] Like appearance to impure sense-power of eye-defect's hair-shadow.
[9728] [9729] From that same source:
[9729] [9730] To mind itself existing as object,
[9730] [9731] Various appearances self-arise.
[9731] [9732] Name and color individually
[9732] [9733] Complete as two aspects of form.
[9733] [9734] Thus it is spoken.
[9734] [9735] Though appearing to mind, these outer-clear appearance manners are not self's mind,
[9735] [9736] Existing also without self,
[9736] [9737] Abiding as field,
[9737] [9738] Color,
[9738] [9739] Because seeing as shape etc.
[9739] [9740] Not mind because those do not exist in mind.
[9740] [9741] Here, giving introduction like dream delusion of clear-appear, not existing: these appearances of outer appearance fields like form etc.,
[9741] [9742] "This is form,"
[9742] [9743] Thinking color etc., arising-arising, first the appearance-field of arising, holding that is called "mind of appearance,"
[9743] [9744] Called "mind of grasping,"
[9744] [9745] Having seized essence, called "mind of field."
[9745] [9746] Questioning if that mind of appearance exists: not true by holding clear-appear without field,
[9746] [9747] Also not existing by color not established as essence seize,
[9747] [9748] Also not existing by examining in three: arise, cease, abide.
[9748] [9749] Called "giving introduction of mind itself as empty,"
[9749] [9750] Give introduction as wisdom Buddha without self-dissolving place.
[9750] [9751] Therefore ordinary Dharma and
[9751] [9752] Great perfect ordinary's appearance,
[9752] [9753] Not separating appearance field,
[9753] [9754] Desiring outer appearance field self-characteristic as mind
[9754] [9755] Is mistake into odor-with various-true mind-only.
[9755] [9756] Here, at time of giving introduction of appearance as mind, mind holding as appear-not-appear,
[9756] [9757] Mind of appearance to mind first meeting field,
[9757] [9758] After, examining that distinction as mental event, desiring called "mind of holding,"
[9758] [9759] Called "samsara: delusion-hold, delusion-appear, purify, abandon."
