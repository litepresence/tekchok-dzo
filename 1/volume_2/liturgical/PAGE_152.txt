[6454] Through non-increase, know non-birth.
[6455] Through non-birth, know non-death.
[6456] Knowing that, know also no evil in actions.

[6457] From the Condensed:
[6458] "This pair of existence and non-existence is the dharma of non-existence."

[6460] Thus, knowing self-empty from primordial beginning,
[6461] "How could beings be born, being pure from the beginning?"
[6462] Thus it is said.

[6463] Moreover, mind is conditionless:
[6464] If it existed, like appearances appearing variously, mind also would become various in color, etc., through conditions.
[6465] Mind having become different, memory-thought is unsuitable as one.
[6466] If mind had conditions, it would certainly be destroyed—
[6467] Concluding no action-result in mind.
[6468] Even if mind ceases, if its action exists,
[6469] This is greatly contradictory,
[6470] Equal to saying that body's color, sense-bases, good and bad all dwell even when body ceases.

[6471] Thus, clear through mere dwelling like illusion.

[6472] If conditionless, from what does this various memory-thought now arise?
[6473] This present memory-thought does not arise from conditions—
[6474] Like happiness and holding as true upon finding yesterday's dream jewel,
[6475] When waking, nothing exists.
[6476] Even though now's memory-thought is held as true and attached, after that nothing exists—there is no establishment from circumstance's true-false-like appearance.

[6477] For example: like sky's various clouds suddenly gathering, without trace of where they went, suddenly dissolving,
[6478] Though clouds do not exist in sky, they appear in its nature.

[6479] Though conditions and causes do not exist in mind, like appearing appearances, at the time of appearing, cause and condition do not exist—certain of non-existence through examination of one, many, and three times.

[6480] From the Root of Wisdom:
[6481] "From seed ceased and not ceased,
[6482] Sprout's birth does not exist.
[6483] You have shown all dharmas
[6484] Arising like illusions."

[6486] "The fifth condition is non-existent."
[6487] Thus said.

[6488] Also from the All-Creating:
