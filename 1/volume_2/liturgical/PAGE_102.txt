All sentient beings, led by three afflictions into three realms—
From that, liberation.
Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—
Therefore determined as three.

From the wheel of samsaric karma:
Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges;
Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;
When ripening into body, delight in speech,
Object chief, desire great,
Delight in desire comes.

To take that into the pure path,
Sambhogakaya posture is shown.
Such beings, always performing supreme sambhogakaya posture,
Become supreme experts in dharmata's meaning.

From samsara's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—
Pig emerges;
That same producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,
Not delighting in speech,
Always delighting in sleep comes.
Always abiding in dharmakaya posture,
Determined to abide in dharmata for three times.

First, aversion impure ripening into form—
Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
This, delighting in body action, desire to move,
Body strength great, body coarse,
Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
Always abiding in nirmanakaya posture, determined to become buddha.
Therefore posture is determined as three.

Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.
More than that not needed;
Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.

At this time, speech main-point: cutting speech.
