Reality bindu without fabrication, pervading all;
Samantabhadra bindu appearing without good, bad, big, or small;
Expanse bindu clear without outer or inner;
Pure expanse bindu arising without deviation, obscuration, or direction-falling;
Wisdom bindu dwelling without primordial making;
Great wisdom bindu appearing directly, unobscured by any affliction—six.

Complete result bindu:
Dharma-kaya bindu single, free of elaboration, beyond identification, primordially pure essence, variously appearing as ways of arising, without any establishing cause.

Bindu characteristic: free of various pain, round without elaboration, showing awareness appearance, great transparent wisdom, gathering five rims into one as kaya place, essence beyond identification because emptiness does not establish as thing.

From that, increase of appearance arises, virtue arising directionless, characteristics unstained by any defect, capacity unceasingly appearing as various play, essence self-pure because characteristics are without duality, nature self-liberated because reasoning arises directionless.

From such bindu becoming expanse, outer signs are certain.

From Blazing Relics:

Who becomes expanse bindu,
This fortunate one sees singly.
Empty bindu lamp,
Self-arising without effort—
All these are own experience signs.
Word elaborations cut,
Other mind not entering even for an instant, no occasion,
Speech-continuum exhausted from saying,
Thought to speak to others
Not possible in this person—
How could sound words follow?
Thus in whom this appears,
That one decides the single elaboration-free.
Thus possessing signs,
Even in two years from that,
Knowing awareness measure,
Dwelling without separation
From expanse and awareness own-appearance—
That also dissolves elements to self,
Without doubt this changes.
