Release, peace, and liberate—recite these words three times. From that, send to river's channel. In reversing from death, no doubt in naraka—thus.

Fourth, showing death-time's appearance: individual appearances of channel-wind disturbed at individual elements' dissolving times. Sign of earth dissolving in earth: body heavy, not able to rise. Sign of water dissolving in water: water flows outward from mouth and nose, then dries. Sign of fire dissolving in fire: heat lost from body's four edges, luster and complexion gathered. Sign of wind dissolving in wind: breath gasps not arising, body's strength lost.

From Sun-Moon Union:

Earth dissolving in earth,
Likewise water, fire, and wind,
Individual individual dissolving in self—
Thus come in birth-being's body.
By earth dissolving in self,
Body heavy, food not taken,
All strength of rising and going exhausted.
At time of water dissolving in water,
Water of mouth and nose drips.
Likewise by fire dissolving in fire,
Mouth and nose greatly dry,
Heat of body's edges lost.
Likewise by wind dissolving in wind,
Breath coarse-coarse, limbs move,
Eye also turns upward—thus.

Fifth, three in instruction of giving: putting space-awareness self-place in excellent habituated; middle purifying transfer; last relying on other conditions.

First: yogins dying alone, without gather-separate in clear-light's appearance, at that time also not depending on other, by clear self-appearance, putting without distraction from that nature. Body key-posture of three which-any, or cross-legged, or by lion's sleep-method, dying in awareness space-awareness placed nature, in that moment liberating as upward penetrate-through, without dharmata intermediate state.

Also from that self:

At that time, the fortune-possessing birth-being,
If appearance self self-clear,
Thus consciousness not-remaining in self-place—thus.
