[5] Thus having shown the distinctions of alaya and Dharmakaya, etc.,
[6] Now, regarding the explanation of dependent arising's nature, there are two:
[7] The common distinction,
[8] And the extensive explanation of individual natures.
[9] First:
[10] Outer elements and inner elements—two types.
[11] From the Self-Arisen:
[12] Elements shown as two types.
[13] Outer elements and inner elements.
[14] Thus.
[15] Outer elements—earth, water, and so forth—these dwell as the basis of inner elements; connected as basis and dependent, therefore definite as two elements.
[16] Without depending on these two, no beings or Buddhas exist.
[17] All beings move in the confused expanse of the five elements,
[18] Possessing the self-nature of the great elements.
[19] All Buddhas dwell in the expanse of the five pure elements—earth without solidity, etc.,
[20] Moving in the complete cessation of stains of the five great elements.
[21] Furthermore, the great elements are luminous wisdom possessing five colors;
[22] The minor elements are earth, water, fire, wind, space—five.
[23] The pure five elements are:
[24] Clear,
[25] Warm,
[26] Light,
[27] Cool,
[28] Expansive,
[29] Holding the self-nature of movement.
[30] From the purity of the five confused elements, the five luminous arrive in the expanse, meeting the inner expanse,
[31] Like the pure great elements of spontaneous presence's appearance.
[32] Regarding minor elements, also element form,
[33] And actual elements—two.
[34] Element form is the five appearing externally now: earth, water, fire, wind, space.
[35] Actual elements are the five qualities of the body—thin, etc.—becoming the basis of the five inner elements.
[36] Inner elements:
[37] The individual five dharma-elements, basis of pure realms.
[38] Therefore all samsara and nirvana, unmoving from the expanse of the five elements;
[39] Before the five elements, samsara and nirvana do not arise.
[40] From the Self-Arisen:
[41] KYE HO, Secret Lord, listen!
[42] The characteristics of the five elements:
[43] I show—you must understand.
[44] The great elements, Bhagavan,
[45] Dwell as the nature of all beings.
[46] All beings of the three realms
[47] Move in the expanse of the five elements.
[48] Before the time when elements did not exist,
[49] Neither Buddhas nor beings—names did not exist.
[50] The five elements themselves are the mother expanse.
[51] Not established from the five elements,
[52] Not even one birth-going being exists.
[53] The elements of beings dwelling therein
[54] Are shown as two types.
[55] Thus.
[56] Second: regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, two:
