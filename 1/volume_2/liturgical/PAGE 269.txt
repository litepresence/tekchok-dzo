From that:

Thus in light mandala,
Whoever person gains enlightenment,
This by fortunate great mind,
By emanation to ten directions,
Does beings' benefit by nature—
This does, dakini.

Fourth, sound—four aspects:
Essence, division, cause, and result measure.

Sound essence: resounding in ear faculty.

Division: though exist pleasant, unpleasant, middle etcetera, here slow continuity long peaceful drum-sound and fierce short wrathful thunder-sound two—called hum and thug.

Cause: general cause from condition of two clashing in sky gap, here arises from cause of obtaining stability.

Result: obtaining sambhogakaya and from that emanation spreading.

That slow continuity long hum obtains stability from peaceful kaya in samadhi seven days; hum thug stack fierce short liberates to wrathful kaya.

That two also exist in five races.
Examining sign of liberating in whatever five race: if resounds east of yogin died place or corpse direction, vajra race; south, jewel race; west, lotus race; north, action race; if arises up, accomplishes buddha of thus-gone race.

From Blazing Relics:

Where died place house,
East direction near,
Sound very resounds,
This becomes vajra race.
Likewise south direction,
Sound appears jewel race.
West lotus likewise.
North becomes action race.
Likewise up thus-gone.

Sound nature this-like:
Hum thug stack and
Continuity long gentle long sound,
By peaceful wrathful distinction.
Thus possessing sound,
This sambhogakaya,
Able kaya result.
That all equal sambhogakaya measure.
Thus also sambhogakaya,
Able to emit emanation kaya,
By method of able accord enter,
This ground final-reach.
