[552] Explaining briefly summarized here:
[553] The awareness-jewel of primordially pure essence abides in the palace of luminous self-nature, in the secret cavity, as the master of essence, nature, and compassion-three.
[554] Although that essence, abiding as kaya, self-purpose unclear, outer-appearing kaya arise base non-ceasing, self-clear.
[555] Nature: light-five arise base, life wind, four branches, primordially abiding as essence of speech.
[556] Compassion, self-arisen awareness essence, spontaneous completion as wisdom of two-knowing.
[557] Abiding without shift or change from the intention of kaya and wisdom without gathering or separation.
[558] The two knowings:
[559] Depending on inner-clear Dharma-nature essence, all-knowing;
[560] Depending on outer-clear Dharma-possessor aspect, wisdom appearing as all-aspect-knowing.
[561] Five winds: from the portion of root life wind, compassion, awareness wisdom—if pure, Buddha wisdom;
[562] If impure, become base of appearing as sentient beings' realization aggregate.
[563] The four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion potency, like rays from the sun:
[564] Upward-going wisdom horse and
[565] Downward-clearing wisdom ray potential light and
[566] Power possessing ripening equal to fire and
[567] Power possessing completing pervading—four.
[568] Although these also exist in the portion of life wind alone,
[569] In dimension, not emanated;
[570] Abiding only as essence of non-ceasing emanate-base.
[571] Essence branch clear as light.
[572] Thus stated also, from the Kunsal:
[573] The manner of abiding of that kaya:
[574] Like form-reflection of empty-luminous bubble.
[575] The abiding nature of that speech:
[576] Like fire spark rays, four branch winds
[577] Clear in the expanse of awareness.
[578] The clear nature of that mind:
[579] The self-essence of life wind,
[580] Like wisdom fire spark without falling direction,
[581] Abides as five wisdoms of essence of essence.
[582] Thus.
[583] That also is wisdom non-deceived by any concept.
