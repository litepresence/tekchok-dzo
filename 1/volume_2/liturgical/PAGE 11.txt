[552] Explaining briefly summarized here:
[553] The awareness-jewel of primordially pure essence abides in the palace of luminous self-nature, in the secret cavity, as the master of essence, nature, and compassion-three.
[554] Although that essence, abiding as kaya, has unclear self-purpose, it is self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from the non-ceasing base of appearance.
[555] Nature: the base of arising of the five lights, life wind, and four branches, primordially abiding as the essence of speech.
[556] Compassion, self-arisen awareness essence, spontaneously complete as the wisdom of two-knowing.
[557] Abiding without shift or change from the intention of kaya and wisdom without gathering or separation.
[558] The two-knowing:
[559] Depending on the inner-clear essence of dharma-nature, all-knowing;
[560] Depending on the outer-clear aspect of dharma-possessor, wisdom appearing as all-aspect-knowing.
[561] Five winds: from the portion of root life wind, compassion, awareness wisdom—if pure, Buddha wisdom;
[562] If impure, become the base of arising as the aggregate of sentient beings' realization.
[563] The four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion potency, like rays from the sun:
[564] The upward-going wisdom horse and
[565] The downward-clearing wisdom ray, potential light, and
[566] The power possessing ripening equal to fire, and
[567] The power possessing completing pervasion—four.
[568] Although these also exist only in the portion of life wind,
[569] In dimension, not emanated;
[570] Abiding only as essence of the non-ceasing base of emanation.
[571] Essence branch clear as light.
[572] Thus stated, also from the Kunsal:
[573] The manner of abiding of that kaya:
[574] Like the form-reflection of empty-luminous bubble.
[575] The abiding nature of that speech:
[576] Like rays of fire sparks, four branch winds
[577] Clear in the expanse of awareness.
[578] The clear nature of that mind:
[579] The self-essence of life wind,
[580] Like wisdom fire sparks without falling direction,
[581] Abides as the five wisdoms of essence of essence.
[582] Thus.
[583] That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept.
