[552] Explaining briefly summarized here:
[553] Primordially pure essence's awareness-jewel abides in luminous self-nature's palace, in secret cavity, as essence-nature-compassion-three's master.
[554] Although that essence, abiding as kaya, has unclear self-purpose, it is self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from appearance's non-ceasing base.
[555] Nature: five lights' arising base, life wind, and four branches, primordially abiding as speech's essence.
[556] Compassion, self-arisen awareness-essence, spontaneously complete as two-knowing's wisdom.
[557] Abiding without shift or change from kaya-wisdom's non-gathering non-separating intention.
[558] The two-knowing:
[559] Depending on dharmata's inner-clear essence, all-knowing;
[560] Depending on dharmapossessor's outer-clear aspect, all-aspect-knowing appearing as wisdom.
[561] Five winds: from root life-wind's portion, compassion, awareness-wisdom—if pure, buddha-wisdom;
[562] If impure, become beings' realization-aggregate arising-base.
[563] Four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion-potency, like sun's rays:
[564] Upward-going wisdom-horse and
[565] Downward-clearing wisdom-ray, potential-light, and
[566] Fire-equal ripening-possessing power, and
[567] Completing-pervasion possessing power—four.
[568] Although these also exist only in life-wind's portion,
[569] In expanse, not emanated;
[570] Abiding only as emanation's non-ceasing base's essence.
[571] Essence-branch clear as light.
[572] Thus stated, also from the Kun gsal:
[573] That kaya's abiding manner:
[574] Like empty-luminous bubble's form-reflection.
[575] That speech's abiding nature:
[576] Like fire-sparks' rays, four branch winds
[577] Clear in awareness-expanse.
[578] That mind's clear nature:
[579] Life-wind's self-essence,
[580] Like wisdom fire-sparks without falling-direction,
[581] Abide as essence-of-essence's five wisdoms.
[582] Thus.
[583] That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept.
