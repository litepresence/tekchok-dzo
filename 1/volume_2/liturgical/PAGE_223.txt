[9538] Though there are many forms of showing examples, among examples, that which becomes supreme is called the precious crystal.
[9539] Through showing by means of the crystal, naturally completely pure, clear without outside or inside,
[9540] Recognize the dharmakāya.
[9541] Relying on the inner light of the crystal,
[9542] From the wind possessing four limbs that becomes the life of prajñā,
[9543] Recognize the manner of clarity as the body of prajñā.
[9544] Relying on the light of outer clarity,
[9545] Recognize the manner of arising of light as the emanation body.
[9546] Through showing by means of the crystal support, recognize the nature of ground-abiding wisdom.
[9547] Recognize the wisdom holding the characteristic of inner clarity.
[9548] Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through outer clarity.
[9549] Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through dissolving inside.
[9550] Through showing the various appearances of the crystal,
[9551] Recognize the manner of appearing.
[9552] Through showing the nature of the crystal itself, recognize the single abiding nature.
[9553] Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.
[9554] These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:
[9555] From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:
[9556] Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,
[9557] The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.
[9558] Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9559] Relying on signs, confidence is born.
[9560] Through deciding the essence of meaning,
[9561] The three wisdoms established in the ground,
[9562] Abiding in the manner of a seed,
[9563] Through prajñā arising from conditions,
[9564] Through ripening in the manner of fruit,
[9565] The darkness of non-recognition is cleared.
[9566] Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,
[9567] The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.
[9568] The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.
[9569] To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body
[9570] Should be introduced.
[9571] In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.
[9572] That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa,
[9573] The teacher holds a single clear mirror,
[9574] Shows the student,
[9575] And speaks these words:
[9576] "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,
[9577] "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.
[9578] "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.
[9579] "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.
[9580] "Rigpa abiding in direct penetration is like crystal.
[9581] "Rigpa, thought-free and clear, is like crystal.
[9582] "Rigpa abiding in spontaneous presence is like crystal.
[9583] "Rigpa, unceasing and direction-free, is like crystal."
[9584] Thus it is said.
