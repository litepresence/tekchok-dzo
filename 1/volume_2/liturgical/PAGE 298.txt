Teeth closed, or various animal voices uttered from mouth, or eye covered by dust-eye appearance—these are explained as outer-inner signs meeting.

Seventh, three in birth-place purifying rite: purifying at death-time, purifying on corpse, purifying after. First, from Sun-Moon Union:

By preparation of letter A,
Join breath and that number;
If not dying in that interval,
By breath placing mouth in crown,
Also in body's center by consciousness,
Focus A and gather.

Thus: at time of possessing rite like that, if that person's breath not separated, by letter together with breath, purify remaining without doubt—thus. Explaining this method for pulling most goers not seeing this dharma's door toward high realms.

Put thinking white light's sphere like egg inside that person's heart; doing pair focus as that gone upward-to-upward; self also focusing on that consciousness become like that; reciting A with tone together for short time, joining with that person's age breath outward going long; at time of breath gasping-gasping, placing mouth in that crown, reciting A A thus twenty-one, steam comes whistle-ru-ru; even evil one, send to high realms; also intellect-possessive view meditation one, send to dharmata.

If one possessing sign of birth toward hell, at time of separating from breath, focus that consciousness A in heart place or navel, melting by fire as light five, remaining self's upper garment moment, send to place above. Hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, gods, and humans also, send from above to above; birth toward human, send to liberation.

Rite of giving benefit by method of obtaining above bliss without experiencing below suffering. That also: if dying focus continue, send to above.
