[12345] From the presence of Glorious Atisha:
[12346] Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
[12347] All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
[12348] Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—
[12349] Habituate looking at self's mind,
[12350] Like thus requested.
[12351] Third, instruction for meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death: generally, impermanent compounded dharmas resemble dream, illusion, etc. From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:
[12352] Exclamation! Compounded things are impermanent,
[12353] Characteristics of dharmas of arising and perishing;
[12354] Than becoming to perish after birth,
[12355] Therefore quick peace is bliss.
[12356] Like star, dust, eye-disease, lamp,
[12357] Magical-illusion, dew, water-bubble,
[12358] Dream, lightning, cloud—
[12359] Compounded dharmas resemble that—thus.
[12360] Especially, example of birth-being's impermanent life from the Great Secret Sun-Moon Union Tantra:
[12361] Whatever body-possessing birth-beings,
[12362] Life is impermanent like dream,
[12363] By dream establishment not exists;
[12364] Life impermanent like rushing-water,
[12365] By falling-water not exist sitting as one;
[12366] Life like grasp-not wind,
[12367] By wind birth-being seize not;
[12368] Life like short-duration emanation,
[12369] By emanation always remain not;
[12370] Life like true-not magical-illusion,
[12371] By magical-illusion true ground seize not;
[12372] Life like not-staying traveler,
[12373] By traveler always sit not;
[12374] Life like not-certain rain-cloud,
[12375] By cloud time seize not.
[12376] Thus birth-being's life extent
[12377] Is thus not certain as one,
[12378] Sudden and thunder-fall,
[12379] Time thus not seized.
[12380] From the Extensive Play Sutra:
[12381] Life impermanent like play's cloud,
[12382] Like mountain-cascade falling-water goes quick fast—thus.
[12383] From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:
[12384] Some remain in womb then die,
[12385] Likewise some after birth...
