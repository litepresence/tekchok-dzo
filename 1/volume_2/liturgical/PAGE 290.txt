Page 290 - Liturgical Translation

There in beautiful medicine tree flower grove,
Possessing cloud canopy of peaceful dharma manner,
By flickering gold light of awareness-holder conqueror,
May one life's clear-light essence be accomplished!

From liberation's mansion jewel palace,
By resounding tone of peaceful dharma manner drum sound,
All goers not remaining wake from ignorance sleep,
May manifestly buddha in original ground!

The clear-natured one with weariness-mind,
Desiring to go one-along to peaceful forest,
Speaking tone of wished words from heart:
May quickly accomplish by pure faith virtue!

Thus called are interval verses.

Second, examining death's signs from the Thal-logical Result:

Death's signs also twenty-one;
Gone to solitary charnel-ground direction,
Do worship and give to master;
Also by eating and drinking,
Do please other goers;
From that, also examine outer, inner, secret death signs—thus said.

All ordinary not knowing when die,
Transcended in distinction from world outsiders examining by divination, pra, etc.;
Yogin's seizing time certainly:
Gone to person-not-exist valley empty, retreat, charnel-ground, forest-retreat, mountain valley, etc., doing life form examination, etc.

From Sun-Moon Union:

At the time of death-lord demon rising,
Thus examine death-time intermediate state;
In solitary place or valley empty,
Precious to seize death's time—thus.

Examining actual: from uncommon and common. First, from that self: form-reflection in sky's space, becoming impermanent and dissolving, moon-form not existing is death. Limb four break in four months; above that head break in three months; upper lower divide in two months; roll in fist in one month—know that time.

Sky-earth two's connection-rope: if becoming cut, not able more than nineteen days. From Meru's sides, not falling from white lion, not liberated by sixteen days. If at mountain and plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree waist breaks—these also examine by wise one.
