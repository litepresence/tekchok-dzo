[8195] Wind gather obstacle mind unhappy, affliction thought movement, heart ache—all clear. Time those fierce throw, essence supreme.
[8196] That-also: wind essence this not-know, cultivate appearance increase, sign measure arise—definitely not-become.
[8197] Second: seeing gate essence three. Gaze three whichever doing, effort held not, stomach relaxed self-arrive made. Eye not-move, gaze held essence that.
[8198] From Thal-'gyur:
[8199] */ Distant-settled move not essence,
[8200] */ This time gaze three apply.
[8201] Thus.
[8202] Third: guiding expanse essence three. Eye slow corner up-down, expanse appearance limit, eye not-move, recognition movement-not, awareness clear-empty piece piece settle—essence.

[8213] */ Sign elaboration apart sky to,
[8214] */ Grasping-grasped apart dharmakaya garuda soar.
[8215] */ Dharmata self-appearance thig-le, condition coo.
[8216] Thus.
[8217] Fourth: outer object sky cloud dissolve gaze, rig-pa clear-dissolved portion, appearance increase quick. Inner object expanse lamp gaze, luminosity mother-child connect. Secret object rig-pa self-clear gaze, ka-dag dharmas exhausted dgongs-pa, self-place clear essence existing.
[8218] From Rang-shar:
[8219] */ Sky empty mandala in,
[8220] */ Unaltered lamp forms four,
[8221] */ Not-ceased meaning clear.
[8222] */ Rig-pa expanse lamp is,

[8226] */ Ye-she five heart body,
[8227] */ Knot manner arise.
[8228] */ That also: go and come,
[8229] */ Move and flicker.

[8231] */ Placed rig-pa not-move if,
[8232] */ Changeless realization excellent explained.
[8233] */ Wisdom self-occurred lamp is,
