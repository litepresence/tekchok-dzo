[9585] Though five lights are clear to outer eye,
[9586] Possessing nature of clear from within,
[9587] Nature:
[9588] White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.
[9589] Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,
[9590] By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within.

[9591] Then demonstrating delusion-base:
[9592] Extend crystal to sun-ray,
[9593] Demonstrate outer two interior lights,
[9594] Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.
[9595] Field possessing five colors,
[9596] Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.
[9597] That beginning move arises together with light,
[9598] Arises as knowable's obscuration: co-arising ignorance.
[9599] By wisdom's sense-power transcending from All-Good base, separate distinction in one moment,
[9600] Complete Buddha in one moment,
[9601] Is before Buddha as great-grandfather without common of all Buddhas.
[9602] By this liberation manner,
[9603] Should know all first Buddha's arising manner and arising manner.
[9604] First Buddha without cause,
[9605] Buddha without beginning or end,
[9606] One wisdom eye without stain.
[9607] Thus spoken from Manjushri.
[9608] Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.
[9609] Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in samsara now also arise from space.
[9610] That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear,
[9611] Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.
[9612] Thus,
[9613] Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.
[9614] That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,
[9615] Or placing each white light on each white color etc.
[9616] There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.
