From Thalgyur:
Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
Must be made firm.

Thus it was said.

First, speech training:
Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
Then train long;
Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.

Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
Not mixing even one syllable with others.
At this time, body's sign makes meaning understood.

Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
Not even body sign.

From Seed Tantra:
Speech like a mute,
Not making sign with anyone,
Thus, whoever does this—
Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.

Thus it was said.

Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
By body purified, buddhas and bodhisattvas and sky-goer dakinis
Bless, liberating body into illusory body.

Then, object blocked, speech purified—
Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
That sign: first seeing non-human form,
Then clairvoyance arises.

Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.

From Thalgyur:
Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished.

Thus it was said.

Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—
Dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut.

From Seed Tantra.
