[4597] From Thalgyur:
[4598] Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
[4599] Must be made firm.
[4600] Thus it was said.
[4601] First, speech training:
[4602] Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
[4603] Then train long;
[4604] Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.
[4605] Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
[4606] Not mixing even one syllable with others.
[4607] At this time, body's sign makes meaning understood.
[4608] Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
[4609] Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
[4610] Not even body sign.
[4611] From Seed Tantra:
[4612] Speech like a mute,
[4613] Not making sign with anyone,
[4614] Thus, whoever does this—
[4615] Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.
[4616] Thus it was said.
[4617] Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
[4618] Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
[4619] By body purified, buddhas and bodhisattvas and sky-goer dakinis
[4620] Bless, liberating body into illusory body.
[4621] Then, object blocked, speech purified—
[4622] Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
[4623] Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
[4624] That sign: first seeing non-human form,
[4625] Then clairvoyance arises.
[4626] Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
[4627] Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
[4628] From Thalgyur:
[4629] Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished.
[4630] Thus it was said.
[4631] Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—  Dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut.  From Seed Tantra.
