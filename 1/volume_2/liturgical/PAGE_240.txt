[10323] [10323] Long time of beginningless habit-continuum,
[10324] [10324] Immediate non-virtue arising near,
[10325] [10325] By karma's force strong,
[10326] [10326] From only possessing former signs,
[10327] [10327] Not protecting by that, after,
[10328] [10328] By karma mixed various of former little virtue and now,
[10329] [10329] Sign-possessing body: form,
[10330] [10330] Speech: distinction from that, Brahma caste,
[10331] [10331] Sign-possessing mind: birth in demigod.
[10332] [10332] From that same source:
[10333] [10333] From obstacle in this itself,
[10334] [10334] Not obtaining fruit itself,
[10335] [10335] From mind, mind-disturbing place,
[10336] [10336] From body, likewise form realm god,
[10337] [10337] To speech, Brahma place.
[10338] [10338] Thus it is spoken.
[10339] [10339] Second, also to manner of three now signs arising by how familiarized by speech:
[10340] [10340] If sign arises, making diligent yogin to three body, speech, mind,
[10341] [10341] Obtain liberation in two lives,
[10342] [10342] Not obtaining otherwise.
[10343] [10343] Sign and that nature:
[10344] [10344] From that same source:
[10345] [10345] Also to all sentient beings like that,
[10346] [10346] To three Buddha bodies before,
[10347] [10347] Also as sign of familiarizing and purifying,
[10348] [10348] Thus arise, sky-goer.
[10349] [10349] To all Buddhas' body itself,
[10350] [10350] Of whoever familiarized before,
[10351] [10351] Stable spoken words,
[10352] [10352] Also without change from ceasing.
