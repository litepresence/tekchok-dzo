[6416] Without returning place, the coming of numberless sentient being aggregates is unsuitable.

[6417] If that mind were various, self-other thoughts suddenly coming to realms is unsuitable.

[6418] Through mutual intermixing,
[6419] Self-conquest,
[6420] Non-death,
[6421] Absence of suffering,
[6422] Possession of retinue and enjoyments bringing happiness,
[6423] Defeat of others and all shared perceptions coming uniformly is unsuitable.

[6424] If they were different,
[6425] Since many realms exist,
[6426] It would be suitable for some to come with agreement with others through self-defeat, happiness, and so forth.

[6427] If one only thinks, would all die through one dying,
[6428] Or would all be born through one being born?

[6429] Thus, examining and searching one's own mind through the door of many aspects with the controversy of one and different,
[6430] Finding nothing is realizing with the power of wisdom the meaning of primordial purity of dharmata.

[6431] Mind having no cause, return is impossible—boundless faith in accumulation of actions.
[6432] Mind having cause, result must come.
[6433] If result is samsara, impure, liberation is impossible.
[6434] If transcended, samsara's coming is unsuitable.

[6435] If both,
[6436] Samsara and nirvana being different, mind also becomes different.

[6437] If different,
[6438] Like body and mind being different, desires gathered in one family of memory-thought would become many different—from
[6439] Knowing through gathering in one family.

[6440] Moreover: if mind has no cause, these minds are unsuitable.
[6441] These do not arise from mind's cause, for they are not intelligence.
[6442] Not arising from mind, there is no failure to realize mind's mere dwelling in itself.

[6443] These birth,
[6444] Death,
[6445] Abiding, and so forth neither exhaust
[6446] Nor increase—
[6447] From scripture:
[6448] "In this ignorance-illusion wheel, no exhaustion, no increase."

[6449] And:
[6450] "The nature of the realm of beings also has no end."
[6451] Thus said.

[6453] Thus, through causelessness, know increase not existing in mind.
