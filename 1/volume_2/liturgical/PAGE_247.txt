Know demonic deception at that time.

Of the second, uncommon supreme secret signs made manifest—three aspects:
General showing of body, speech, and mind signs of preliminary training;
Particular explanation of clear-light signs of main training;
Expression of other distinctions of signs, grasping the measure of the path.

Of the first, from three aspects:
Signs of nose-training of three kayas, preliminary training of four elements' sound and meaning.

From Blazing Relics:

What sounds of elements,
Who is familiar with sounds of six races,
Elements do not harm this,
Likewise fire does not burn,
Water does not drown nor carry away,
Foot not touching ground,
Able to go through mid-space,
Wind does not chill nor shake—
Thus in whom these arise,
Is familiar with four elements' sounds.

Signs of mind nose-training, preliminary training measure of body, speech, and mind:

From that:
Knowing in an instant
Beings appearing and not appearing,
Because six races do not take form,
Know sounds of six beings,
Because six beings' mind-continuum is self-cut,
Know all their thoughts,
Because confusion thought is exhausted—
Briefly, six clairvoyances arise,
Six beings' appearance
Abides in own nature,
Cutting later birth-continuum.
Thus this person cuts,
All these own signs arise.

Signs of awareness nose-training, separating samsara-nirvana border:

From that also:
Before separating samsara-nirvana border,
Body, speech, and mind go,
Familiar in conduct,
Thus tantra signs arise.
Body attachment self-reverses,
Confusion attachment continuum cuts,
No attachment to own body,
Conduct in sky,
Likewise able to enter ground,
Knowing thought and non-thought meaning,
Dharma also speaks from mouth.
Thus in whom these arise,
By body, speech, and mind,
Is liberated from all
Samsara realization bondage,
Later body, speech, mind connection cuts.
