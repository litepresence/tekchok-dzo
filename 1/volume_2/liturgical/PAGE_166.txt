[7038] [7038] From Letter Non-Existent:
[7039] [7039] All arising: delusion appearance my mind;
[7040] [7040] All abiding: delusion appearance my heart;
[7041] [7041] All appearing: delusion appearance my body;
[7042] [7042] All sounding: delusion appearance my speech.
[7043] [7043] Seeing not-ceasing: appear like my form;
[7044] [7044] Hearing not-ceasing: sound like my sound;
[7045] [7045] Smelling not-ceasing: feel like my smell;
[7046] [7046] Tasting not-ceasing: tone like my taste;
[7047] [7047] Feeling not-ceasing: quick like my mind;
[7048] [7048] Secret afflictions: my miracles;
[7049] [7049] Buddhas beings: my cemetery;
[7050] [7050] All-making I: great self-clear appearance.
[7051] [7051] Thus it is said.
[7052] [7052] Then: if allowing delusion appearance to self-place release, will delusion not go again?
[7053] [7053] Although ordinary beings delude by grasping as self,
[7054] [7054] Yogis: by knowing basis-non-existent, not delude by placing self-settled without correcting-changing.
[7055] [7055] From Pearl Garland:
[7056] [7056] Those beings in samsara
[7057] [7057] Bind by self concepts' actions;
[7058] [7058] Certain liberate by knowing nature non-existent.
[7059] [7059] Thus it is said.
[7060] [7060] Also: delusion and liberation rely on inner knowing,
[7061] [7061] For outer appearance makes no delusion and liberation—
[7062] [7062] Enough to place appearance straight.
[7063] [7063] By Tilopa:
[7064] [7064] Appearance not bind; grasping binds—
[7065] [7065] Cut grasping, Naropa.
[7066] [7066] Thus the instruction.
[7067] [7067] That also: only placing self-know that actual meaning in self-tone nature,
[7068] [7068] Not correctable to good by purposefully corrected view-meditation-action, for nature unchangeable, and
[7069] [7069] For self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes not true.
[7070] [7070] From Perfection:
[7071] [7071] By thought not find primordial wisdom meaning;
[7072] [7072] By thought finding primordial wisdom meaning—
[7073] [7073] Self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7074] [7074] By meditation not see dharmakaya;
[7075] [7075] By meditation seeing dharmakaya—
[7076] [7076] Self-appearance dharmata becomes false.
[7077] [7077] By looking not realize awareness meaning;
[7078] [7078] By looking realizing awareness meaning—
[7079] [7079] Ceaseless dharmakaya becomes false.
[7080] [7080] By dharma not cut ignorance trace;
[7081] [7081] By dharma cutting ignorance trace—
[7082] [7082] Primordially pure primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7083] [7083] Thus it is said.
[7084] [7084] Thus: whatever conduct manner made, not transcend dharmata by realizing appear-know to dharmata.
