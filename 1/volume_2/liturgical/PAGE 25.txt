[1252] The manner of appearance to those trained;
[1253] The manner of appearance in the intermediate state.

[1254] First:
[1255] Although light radiantly abides in oneself, to the six realms not knowing their own face, now the self-light of the lamp exists in subtle portions.

[1256] From that itself:
[1257] To all unrealized beings:
[1258] In humans, it exists as an example;
[1259] In gods, it is visible;
[1260] In demigods, it exists subtly;
[1261] In animals, merely in their own abode;
[1262] In hungry ghosts, it flickers;
[1263] In hell realms, like a sesame grain—
[1264] Thus the six lights abide.

[1265] Thus it is spoken.

[1266] That light also is merely the tone existing inside the heart.
[1267] By nature, the light of ripening-result latencies exists in gods as distant visibility, etcetera;
[1268] It is the light of contaminated ripening-result virtue,
[1269] Not the self-light of the heart essence.

[1270] Second: in the manner of appearance to those trained on the path—nine aspects: light abode,
[1271] Path,
[1272] Field,
[1273] Body,
[1274] Eye,
[1275] Essence,
[1276] Example and simile,
[1277] Time,
[1278] Liberation place.

[1279] Abode: In the heart, the thigle of five spontaneously accomplished lights, in the center of five colors, the five kayas abiding as father-mother cluster mandala,
[1280] Five elements,
[1281] Five aggregates,
[1282] Five kayas,
[1283] Five families,
[1284] Five wisdoms,
[1285] Abiding in the purity of five grounds;
[1286] From the four appearances,
[1287] Seen when the measure arrives.

[1288] Path: Arising from distant visibility;
[1289] Field: Empty sky;
[1290] Body of light:
[1291] The upward appearances of five kayas and four wisdoms.

[1292] Eye:
[1293] Through the self-arisen lamp of wisdom, knowing one's own face and moving to the expanse.

[1294] Essence:
[1295] All-clear, non-ceasing wisdom.

[1296] Example and simile: Like crystal,
[1297] Although the five lights in the ground-abiding self are not clear, they exist as the ground of arising.

[1298] When conditions are experientially taken and in the intermediate state lamp, ground-appearance fills the sky with five lights.

[1300] Time: If experientially taken, can also appear in this life;
[1301] The time when the intermediate state naturally arises.

[1302] Liberation place: To the first primordially pure jewel secret cavity,
