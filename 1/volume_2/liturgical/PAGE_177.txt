[7491] Also not thus peace itself;
[7492] Not knowing direct insight:
[7493] Like Meru mountain king,
[7494] Not capable to break by whoever.

[7495] Not liberate by antidote;
[7496] Not knowing self-pure without searching:
[7497] Like desiring clear sediment in muddy water,
[7498] Not clear later-later.

[7499] Although that itself clear: not dharmata;
[7500] Not knowing spontaneous self-appearance: like ordinary fool appearance,
[7501] Not reverse apparent attachment.

[7502] By thus saying: should know vital point of self-by-self liberating like water trace.

[7503] This also: from two mind levels—
[7504] Self-liberation with effort:
[7505] Identify whatever arisen affliction, place in self-place—train power in great equal self-liberation of pure abiding-movement nature, self-liberating complete complete gone without wandering even moment.

[7506] Without effort:
[7507] That arisen incapable to bear, self-liberated dharmata—
[7508] Liberate by nature nature or force without needing abandon that view-method to that.

[7509] These two mind levels: first distinction and
[7510] Abide like before-after.

[7511] From That Itself:
[7512] These two mind levels:
[7513] All with effort and without effort.
[7514] Place all with effort in self-place,
[7515] All measures of familiarized appearance:
[7516] Itself pure primordial wisdom appearance.
[7517] When self-dawning to all outer-inner,
[7518] Not arise by that condition.
[7519] Although those arise-change until,
[7520] Liberate in self-place itself by self-place.
[7521] From that: yogi appearance.

[7522] All without effort thus:
[7523] Self-by-self liberated to self itself,
[7524] From self blank self self-liberated—
[7525] Like splitting all iron by iron, and
[7526] Like breaking all stone by stone:
[7527] Self antidote self itself great,
[7528] By realizing nature complete great.
[7529] Whatever familiarized thus:
[7530] Find all meanings of non-searching placing,
[7531] Spread great bliss without meditating,
[7532] Directly know in nature itself.
