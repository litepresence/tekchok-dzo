Here gathering in three from: there, first piece think white AOM and throw; second with red AH throw; last throw without thinking anything. Here all three think as HUM, that consciousness blue-green HUM pull to self's awareness. Also in speech thus HUM cause, forcefully pull to shoe-sole. At that time, producing body-speech-mind three strength of self, pulling inside shoe-sole shoe-sole, that one's wind warm pierce certainly arises to self's inside.

At that time, coming by HRIQ between that other person's eyes; from that, body also comes able to rise suddenly. Like that becoming, show eye's thusness dharmata manifest appearance. When eye becomes suddenly, putting like introducing drop-empty lamp by thumb-finger: clear-light existing in self, that is this; this self at time of coming out from body, dharmata intermediate state arising as self-possessive, this is self-appearance, not other—do recognize self-face, thus hitting three times. When saying "see that appearance" or "understand that instruction," if voice comes, good; even if sign arises, it is hit.

Obtain not-thinking samadhi in dharmata intermediate state, certain to become buddha. That also from Sun-Moon Ga-Union:

If doing other's benefit,
For grasping that self by compassion,
Open door three's doors,
Breath: hold, inhale, and throw;
By inserting syllable three letters,
For producing body, speech, mind strength,
Do with breath together by wise one;
By doing like that again and again,
That one's appearance like this:
If obtaining body's strength,
Do hit instructions;
Yet if consciousness becomes clear,
Put equally in meaning self;
Faculty doors in self near,
Put eye's thusness looking;
If mind of equal remaining arises,
Obtain not-thinking possessing samadhi—thus.

This instruction called "hitting as robe-shake" is one great-important point of this Great Completion. Like that, gathering faculties, also hitting clear by key of reversing death again.
