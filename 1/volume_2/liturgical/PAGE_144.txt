[6088] The object of attachment to self and grasping:

[6089] From the very first, in dharmata,
[6090] All this self-vision by self—
[6091] Not knowing primordial vision before.

[6092] Five afflictions binding self-concept,
[6093] Primordially self-dawning awareness,
[6094] Abiding together, faces not meeting.

[6095] Four elements—earth, water, fire, wind—
[6096] Primordially self-body,
[6097] Dull eye of whoever has not seen.

[6098] Very secret gathering place, speech-essence,
[6099] Self-sounding without interval.
[6100] Whoever has not heard this itself—
[6101] Does ear-power not exist?

[6102] Self-abiding expanse and awareness-scent,
[6103] Self-samsara without occasion to separate.

[6104] Nose ceased from not experiencing feeling?
[6105] Three essences, one coiled instruction-taste,
[6106] Primordially body-mind essence—
[6107] Tongue cut from not experiencing this?

[6108] Self-pure vision, color-ornament,
[6109] Without separating from self-body,
[6110] Like body and shadow,
[6111] Abiding without day or night.

[6112] Inert body, untouched by anyone?
[6113] Dharma of bliss striking suffering everywhere,
[6114] Self-abiding without forgetting.
[6115] Dull mind of whoever has not known.

[6116] Piling again the latencies of samsara,
[6117] Primordially abiding as dharmakaya—
[6118] The place of compassion, unseen by whoever.

[6119] From self-concept object's dawning at powers,
[6120] Various memories, thoughts, and movements,
[6121] Primordially self-dawning as Sambhogakaya—
[6122] Worried forgetting, not remembering all this.

[6123] Do, doer, conduct, effort, accomplishment, and
[6124] All noise of gathered beings
[6125] Primordially as emanation body—
[6126] Dull capability of whoever has not known.

[6127] How thoughts and memories move,
[6128] Like a river's flow, without interval,
[6129] Always attracting self-mind.
[6130] Effortless self-place meditation—
[6131] Straying mind, not understanding experience.

[6132] This vision hearing existing container-contents,
[6133] Although natureless through examination,
[6134] Like cutting the continuum of village-city,
[6135] Not seeing primordial abiding.

[6136] Doors of powers closed?

[6138] From the Thal 'gyur:
