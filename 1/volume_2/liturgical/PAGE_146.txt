[6207] From the Self-Dawning:

[6208] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6209] No view, meditation, or conduct.
[6210] Yet hold well-taught in mind.

[6211] Without accomplishing, without wishing to move ability,
[6212] The meaning of that itself, spontaneously complete without doing, as before.
[6213] Where are doings and doers?
[6214] This self-arisen dharmata without conduct,
[6215] Not falling in any direction, like space,
[6216] Not existence—only oneness of emptiness,
[6217] Not non-existence—true bliss body,
[6218] Not made—self-arisen, concept-free.

[6219] In great perfection ati yoga,
[6220] Where is dharmata of meditation?
[6221] Dharma without sending or keeping,
[6222] Free from end of meditated and non-meditated.

[6223] What defilement of hold-free mind?
[6224] True awareness without defilement;
[6225] Upon stainless pure dharmakaya,
[6226] Nothing to meditate or be meditated.
[6227] Not finding true itself by meditating;
[6228] If found, self-awareness becomes non-existent.

[6229] Why? In self-awareness wisdom,
[6230] Without distracted or non-distracted.
[6231] Where there is holding,
[6232] Self-arisen wisdom does not exist.

[6235] That also: dharmas thus:
[6236] No ceasing from non-birth;
[6237] Free at self-place from non-holding;
[6238] No elaboration from non-reference;
[6239] Existing in all, not arisen from making;
[6240] Fully pure expanse through unconditioned;
[6241] Term of holding separate from dharmas;
[6242] Separate from expression through non-nature.

[6244] From the Nor bu phra bkod:

[6245] Ha ha!
[6246] Dharmata arising from non-dharma;
[6247] Object-like vision from non-object;
[6248] Dharma-free wisdom interiorly clear,
[6249] Memoryless: non-existent as object.

[6251] From the Seng ge rtsal rdzogs:

[6252] This entity-free dharmata without holding-attachment,
[6253] Supreme non-dual intention of all Buddhas.
[6254] Discrimination and marks, path of words,
[6255] Self-place pure dharmata without action-effort,
[6256] Ub chub samadhi entering dharmata-object.
[6257] Pure and impure terms non-existent as dharmas;
[6258] Primordially abiding meaning exceeding one and two,
[6259] Ub by one bindu in the manner of self-body.
