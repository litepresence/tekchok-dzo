[3161] Though person cuts that for desire of essence.

[3162] Inside and outside—all essence not exist.

[3163] Phenomena all thus know do.

[3164] Thus it is.

[3165] Second, nighttime training illusory-body in dream: knowing all appearance as dream like before, training mastery all appearance-existence as illusion-dream.

[3166] Mastering birth-death, denial-affirmation, all deluded-appearance as dream-illusion.

[3167] In dream also thus arising, attachment sesame-grain not exist.

[3168] Again from that:

[3169] How in young girl's dream.

[3170] Seeing son arise and die.

[3171] Joy upon arising, not-joy upon dying—like this.

[3172] Phenomena all thus know do.

[3173] Thus it is.

[3174] At this time path-application virtues arise in self.

[3175] From Abhisamayalankara:

[3176] In dream also all phenomena.

[3177] View as dream-like, etcetera.

[3178] Sign of application reaching peak.

[3179] Taught as twelve aspects.

[3180] Thus it is.

[3181] Thus training illusory-body daytime-nighttime.

[3182] True-attachment to deluded-appearance not exist, and.

[3183] Seeing body also as transparent, shadow-form-like appearance, truth-not-exist.

[3184] Shadow not exist upon body, and.

[3185] Holding bardo illusory-body, becoming final-existence person.

[3186] Like holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton and scholar Nyibum.

[3187] Those also from Thalgyur:

[3188] Train illusory-body dream.

[3189] By that mastery, body itself also.

[3190] Become like shadow-form.

[3191] By that intermediate body.

[3192] These become self-held.

[3193] Thus it is.

[3194] Fourth, practicing depending on instruction of four-times equal-application to clear-light.

[3195] Outer four-times equal-application holding channel-wind in channel.

[3196] Inner four-times equal-application instruction expression cease.

[3197] Secret four-times equal-application instruction mind unmodified settle.

[3198] That-ness four-times equal-application instruction clear-light mother-son unite.
