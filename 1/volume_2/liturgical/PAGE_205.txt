[8782] Bodhicitta, one arrow;
[8783] For emanation-body, one fathom.
[8784] The existence of self-light wisdom-appearance
[8785] From that same source:
[8786] Wisdom locations, large and small,
[8787] From the six directions of appearance
[8788] Are thoroughly explained thus:
[8789] For those in Joyful, one cubit abides.
[8790] For those in Strife, four fingers abide.
[8791] For those with equal, one color-point.
[8792] For those with two, only self-clear.
[8793] For those with hunger, like sesame seed.
[8794] For those with suffering, like horse-hoof.
[8795] Thus it is explained they abide.
[8796] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
[8797] For Bodhisattvas, one arrow.
[8798] For emanation-bodies, one fathom abides.
[8799] For Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,
[8800] And emanation-bodies and gods,
[8801] They appear in manifest fields.
[8802] Below those, in five fields,
[8803] Undemonstrated, they are not seen.
[8804] Thus it is spoken.

[8805] Moreover, the great lamp-appearance of Buddha, Bodhisattva, and god triad self-appearing in intermediate space is due to vast fields; the other five are small because they are fields of one's own body.
[8806] 
[8807] Third, the arising manner of space-awareness has two aspects:
[8808] Space is the outer field-pervasion of great blue light, the self-glow of five lights existing within as five wisdoms; from that expanding, five-possessed great wisdom light two self-arise as field-appearance.
[8809] 
[8810] Awareness is the appearance of vajra nadi-thread with portion-body.
[8811] From Power-Perfect:
[8812] The view-essence of all Buddhas
[8813] Does not surpass space-awareness two.
[8814] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8815] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8816] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8817] To self-arisen space-lamp,
[8818] Self-appear light is unthinkable.
[8819] To bindu-empty lamp,
[8820] Ray-possessed bindu is unthinkable.
[8821] To the essence of five wisdoms,
[8822] Demonstrating words are unthinkable.
[8823] To condition-free field-appearance,
[8824] Cease-free arising is unthinkable.
[8825] Thus it is spoken.

[8826] Fourth, the manner of taking experience has two aspects:
