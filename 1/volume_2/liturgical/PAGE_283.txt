Doing certainty by clear situation, from Sun-Moon Union:

Exclamation! Conqueror, you listen:
By condensing all those,
The drop remaining as one is obtained.
And what and what are they?
By putting, self-spread is obtained;
By intentions, time is shown;
By exhaust-patterns, intention is shown;
By stable confidence, the not-turning sign.
Thus meanings are condensed.

These are that result:
Who sees the space-lamp
Manifestly exercises in dharma-space;
Who sees the drop-lamp
Obtains the hope-base of those with effort;
Who sees the wisdom-lamp
Realizes general and self-characteristic;
Who sees the water-lamp
Obtains power over faculties;
Who is habituated in lu-gu-rgyud,
Awarenesses obtain balance.
By that result of three bodies,
All these are self-awareness ground.

In the intermediate state of nature-remaining,
The birth-being habituated to these,
All elements as self-vanish,
Become in this without doubt.
These dharmas I proclaimed,
All sutras and tantras here condensed—thus extensively said.

Second, the eightfold instruction like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror for giving clarity to unclear in the death-time intermediate state: thinking the cause of certain death with many examples, examining death's signs, showing reversal methods, showing death-time appearance, showing giving instruction, showing birth-place signs, showing purifying rites, showing other uncommon places.

First has three: training in dharma without opportunity for leisure-freedom by thinking on the difficult-to-obtain manner; showing the rite of training; producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on continuous cause of certain decay; meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death.
