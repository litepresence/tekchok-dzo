[8165-8167]

The wheel of dharmatā's three crucial points,
The wheel of day-night luminosity,
The vast wheel of face-expanse wisdom—
Thus the three wheels turn.

[8168-8173]

Four divisions present the first:
Body's three settling points,
Gate's three seeing points,
Expanse's three guiding points,
Object's three appearance points.

[8174-8176]

First: Body's posture, whichever three held,
Stomach relaxed, nerve-wind ease abiding—
This purpose exists.
If deliberately held, wind wrong, spread arise,
Nerve twist tight—the cause.

[8177-8184]

Gaze held, wind essence very slow,
From outer held, nose drawn—
This particular dharma, great gathering.
Common method: nose out-inhale,
Wheel four's inside filled,
Mind clear-clear, meditation produced.

Wind wrong, spread, coil, dull—
Four obstacles arise,
Delusion-appearance not appearing.
Here: wind purified, increase path not made.
