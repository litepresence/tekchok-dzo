Always saying, expression-end ceases.
Thus possessing signs,
If practice this meaning,
Fly in sky,
Transparently penetrate mountain rocks,
Enter under ground,
Arise without drowning in water.
Thus arisen fortunate one,
If confidence not entering expanse-awareness,
Elements dissolve to self,
Change is not self—
From this, transferring birth,
In reality bardo,
Liberate in five instants.
What person possessing fortune,
Familiar with nirmanakaya,
This person becoming confident,
These body, speech, mind signs,
In whom arise,
This also becomes fortune.
Meaning of dharma heard before,
Also in own continuum
Arises simultaneously—
This becomes dakini.
Likewise various words
Of dharma not heard before,
Speak from mouth by nature—
Likewise words of other secret mantra
Tantras, as words,
How clear according to order—
Likewise all dharmas,
All word meaning forms,
Beings' faith,
Dharmas and accord,
How asking, that answer,
This fortunate one speaks,
This is speech lion.
Strength greater than previous,
Gain fast foot strength,
Body without wrinkles,
White hair becomes black,
Likewise like sixteen years,
Possessing youth luster,
Example: grass upon youth,
Rain falls again,
Grows like self-grow—
Compassion not existing before
Arises from depth in this,
After that enters beings' benefit.
When beings arise
For benefit of own body,
However this desires,
Able to give body and limbs—
What need to mention outer possessions?
Likewise able to give
Body etcetera to own guru as before.
Thus in whom arises,
This one touches nirmanakaya.
