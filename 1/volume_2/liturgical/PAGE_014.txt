[685] From threefold expansion:
[686] Completion is this:
[687] From Self-Arisen,
[688] In three kayas' pure appearance,
[689] One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear,
[691] Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating,
[692] In concept-free awareness, pure,
[693] Five light-rays, unceasing and clear,
[694] In non-grasping great self-liberation,
[695] Outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
[696] In action-released awareness,
[697] Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[698] In mind-separated awareness,
[699] All appearance variety complete in single moment.
[700] In self-appearance's great clear purity,
[701] Deluded appearances complete in single moment.
[702] In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[703] Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[704] Such is three kayas' completion manner.
[705] Thus it is said.
[706] Awakening is being without dualistic-grasping aspect—
[707] From that same nature:
[708] Without action, delusion awakens,
[709] Without concept, afflictions awaken,
[710] Without grasping, self-arising awakens,
[711] Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens,
[712] Without attachment, ignorance awakens.
[713] Such is three kayas' awakening manner.
[714] Thus it is said.
[715] By expansion is meant this:
[716] Qualities, primordially spontaneously accomplished, are expansive—
[717] From Self-Arisen,
[718] In concept-free awareness,
[719] Five lights clear, wisdom expansive,
[720] In actor-acted-separated awareness,
[721] Without perceived object, three kayas expand,
[722] In object-free appearing awareness,
[723] Without grasping mind, five lights expand,
[724] In awareness, great wisdom,
[725] Meaning-possessing self-appearance, fruit expands.
[726] Such is three kayas' expansion manner.
[727] Thus it is said.
[728] Second: place expansive explanation.
[729] Dharmakaya,
[730] Sambhogakaya,
[731] Nirmanakaya—three places' expansive explanations.
[732] The first also has:
[733] Essence,
[734] Definition,
[735] Self-body,
[736] Metaphor,
[737] Sign,
[738] Appearance,
[739] Place,
[740] Characteristic,
[741] Object,
[742] Intent—ten in total.
[743] Essence is this:
[744] Empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence—
[745] From that same nature:
[746] Unchanging, cessation without, three-pervading—
[747] Dharmakaya essence.
[748] Thus it is said.
[749] Definition is this:
[750] Expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya being—essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion—
