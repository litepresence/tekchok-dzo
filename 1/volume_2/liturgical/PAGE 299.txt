From that, holding vase at throat, washing by bhaya age amount, send from hungry ghost. From that, holding vase in secret place, combining earth and wind's mixture, send from animal. From that, holding vase in armpit, reciting kem, washing, send from asura. From that, holding vase on crown, reciting tam, washing, send from god's place. From that, reciting om ah hum swaha, holding vase in heart, washing, purify bad human birth-place.
