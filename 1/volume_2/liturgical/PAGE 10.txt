[497] Nondual with life,
[498] Nondual with awareness,
[499] Nondual with lamp,
[500] Nondual with bindhu,
[501] Abide nondual with wisdom.
[502] Third, the five winds producing complexion and radiance—also from That Source:
[503] In the wind producing complexion and radiance also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[504] Wind arising from mind and
[505] Wind possessing radiance and
[506] Wind of burning and
[507] Wind of wildness—five. Thus.
[508] Those also according to sequence: wisdom object,
[509] Appearing object,
[510] Lamp object,
[511] Non-awareness object,
[512] Making the horse of mind's object.
[513] Fourth, the five pervading winds:
[514] From the Self-Arisen:
[515] In the all-pervading wind also five:
[516] Pervading the base and
[517] Pervading immediately and
[518] Pervading hatred and fear and
[519] Pervading memory and
[520] Pervading all in the body by holding—five. Thus.
[521] Those also according to sequence:
[522] Appearing in wisdom,
[523] Appearing in lamp,
[524] Appearing in knowing,
[525] Appearing in thinking,
[526] Making potency appearing in mind.
[527] Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
[528] Again from That Source:
[529] In the compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[530] Wind of making movement and
[531] Wind of making liberation and
[532] Wind of making reversal and
[533] Wind of making swiftness and
[534] Wind of moments—five. Thus.
[535] Those also according to sequence:
[536] Pervading aggregates,
[537] Pervading moments,
[538] Pervading bardo,
[539] Pervading concepts,
[540] Pervading the three—moments, actions, completion.
[541] Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[542] The explanation of these terms:
[543] From the Self-Arisen:
[544] Because of making movement on the true ground,
[545] It is called move-making wind.
[546] Because of holding life of pure wisdom,
[547] It is called life-holding wind.
[548] Because of existing as the self-nature of five wisdom lights,
[549] It is called wind producing complexion and radiance.
[550] Because of being able to liberate into the true dimension of wisdom,
[551] It is called compassionless aeon-karma wind.
[552] Because of abiding without gathering or separating from wisdom's appearing,
[553] It is called fire-equal wind. Thus.
[554] Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness wisdom, now abiding in the heart,
[555] That is the essential point of wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights.
[556] When awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathering,
[557] The non-manifest of outer and inner also arrives at the essential point of pure wind-mind.
