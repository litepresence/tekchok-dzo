[497] Nondual with life,
[498] Nondual with awareness,
[499] Nondual with lamp,
[500] Nondual with bindhu,
[501] Abide nondual with wisdom.
[502] Third, five winds producing complexion and radiance—also from That Source:
[503] In wind producing complexion and radiance also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[504] Various mind-arising wind and
[505] Various radiance-possessing wind and
[506] Various burning wind and
[507] Various agitating wind—five. Thus.
[508] These also according to sequence: wisdom object,
[509] Appearing object,
[510] Lamp object,
[511] Non-awareness object,
[512] Making horse of mind's object.
[513] Fourth, five pervading winds:
[514] From the Self-Arising:
[515] In various-pervading wind also five:
[516] Base-pervading wind and
[517] Immediate-pervading wind and
[518] Hate-fear pervading wind and
[519] Memory-pervading wind and
[520] Body-all-pervading wind by holding—five. Thus.
[521] These also according to sequence:
[522] Appearing in wisdom,
[523] Appearing in lamp,
[524] Appearing in knowing,
[525] Appearing in thinking,
[526] Making potency appearing in mind.
[527] Fifth, five compassion-non-exist karma winds:
[528] Again from That Source:
[529] In compassion-non-exist aeon karma wind also five:
[530] Various-moving wind and
[531] Various-liberating wind and
[532] Various-reversing wind and
[533] Various-quick wind and
[534] Momentary wind—five. Thus.
[535] These also according to sequence:
[536] Pervading aggregates,
[537] Pervading moments,
[538] Pervading bardo,
[539] Pervading thoughts,
[540] Pervading three—momentary, action, completion.
[541] Thus twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[542] Word explanation of these:
[543] From the Self-Arising:
[544] Because making move on true ground,
[545] Called move-making wind.
[546] Because holding life of pure wisdom,
[547] Called life-holding wind.
[548] Because existing as self-nature of five wisdom lights,
[549] Called wind producing complexion and radiance.
[550] Because able to liberate into true dimension of wisdom,
[551] Called compassion-non-exist aeon karma wind.
[552] Because abiding without gathering or separating from wisdom's appearing,
[553] Called fire-equal wind. Thus.
[554] Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness wisdom, now abiding in the heart,
[555] That is the essential point of wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights.
[556] When awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathering, outer-inner non-manifest also
[557] Arrives at the essential point of pure wind-mind.
