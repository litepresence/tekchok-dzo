[1036] Performing disciples' two benefits completion:
[1037] From that same nature:
[1038] Emanation-kaya characteristics:
[1039] Actions completion performing,
[1040] Two aspects considered.
[1041] Thus it is spoken.
[1042] Fourth, divisions: generally explained as nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, and so forth;
[1043] On this occasion, depending upon two benefits' completion establishment,
[1044] Completed actions emanation-kaya
[1045] And performing actions emanation-kaya—these two held.
[1046] Moreover, completed actions emanation-kaya, self-benefit spontaneously established:
[1047] In this life or intermediate state, completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,

[1059] By that cause, all samsara-appearing becomes empty,
[1060] When dissolving into pure nirvana expanse through spontaneous accomplishment gate,
[1061] It is called "Buddha entering nirvana."
[1062] This is crucially important to all wisdom-possessors.
[1063] Furthermore, that emptiness-appearing for self-benefit establishing, being self-arisen emanation that liberates self into expanse, is called completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1064] From Self-Arisen:
[1065] Completed actions emanation-kaya:
[1066] Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened,
[1067] From that, distributing emanations.
