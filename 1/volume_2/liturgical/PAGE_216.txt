[9275] [9275] Conducting in Dharma-nature's display.
[9276] [9276] Fruit:
[9277] [9277] Obtaining Buddha through the gate of qualities. Thus it is spoken.
[9278] [9278] Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[9279] [9279] Buddha-hood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[9280] [9280] Different by distinction of person's sense-power.
[9281] [9281] From that:
[9282] [9282] At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises,
[9283] [9283] Also, for best, middle, and last three sense-powers, three view-signs arise.
[9284] [9284] The view of best sense-power:
[9285] [9285] Like a meteor moving in the sky,
[9286] [9286] Arising as wisdom-power quality,
[9287] [9287] Realizes liberation in three moments.
[9288] [9288] Intention:
[9289] [9289] Abides pervasive to all open clarity, like sun arising in space-between.
[9290] [9290] Conduct:
[9291] [9291] Enjoys in pure complete wisdom-body.
[9292] [9292] Fruit: Thus-come at primordially pure ground in three moments.
[9293] [9293] The view of middle sense-power:
[9294] [9294] Realizes appearance of great leakless Dharma-nature bliss arising by gap.
[9295] [9295] Intention:
[9296] [9296] Seeing each special field of view in each moment,
[9297] [9297] Each special realization arises,
[9298] [9298] And seeing each Dharma-body appearance,
[9299] [9299] Abides in intention of heart's pure suchness.
[9300] [9300] Conduct:
[9301] [9301] Conducts non-dual with self-heart's light-ray.
[9302] [9302] Fruit:
[9303] [9303] Seeing self-awareness's appearance as birthless Dharma-body.
[9304] [9304] The view of last sense-power:
[9305] [9305] In pure wisdom appearance,
[9306] [9306] Did I arise from that,
[9307] [9307] Or did that arise from me—realizes thus thinking.
[9308] [9308] Intention:
[9309] [9309] Abides without seeing agent in that very appearance.
[9310] [9310] Conduct:
[9311] [9311] Endowed with doubt and indecision conduct.
[9312] [9312] Fruit:
[9313] [9313] Obtaining fruit of breathing into nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[9314] [9314] Fourth, the essence of sun-moon equal gap intention:
