[1108] Individual individuals,
[1109] Mind,
[1110] Wisdom,
[1111] Kunzhi,
[1112] Showing kunzhi as Dharmakaya, and so forth—though shown in many ways,
[1113] The nature of Great Completion does not appear in all infinitely through the path for only some capable ones.

[1114] From self-arisen:
[1115] Knowing all languages,
[1116] Showing that in whichever language.
[1117] Gathering the suitable with suitability,
[1118] Some showing through the gate of words,
[1119] Some through the gate of dependent arising,
[1120] Some through the gate of aspiration and application,
[1121] Some through the gate of generation,
[1122] Some through the gate of both,
[1123] Some showing through the five enlightenments,
[1124] Some through the three samadhis,
[1125] Some showing expanse and wisdom.

[1126] Great Completion meaning is without place of contradiction,
[1127] Appearing to some persons with karma.
[1128] The manner of showing is like this:
[1129] Some showing rigpa as empty,
[1130] Some showing absence-of-rigpa as empty,
[1131] Some showing rigpa-not as inert,
[1132] Some showing rigpa alone,
[1133] Some showing kunzhi as Dharmakaya,
[1134] Some showing without virtue or non-virtue,
[1135] Some showing as possessing meditation,
[1136] Some showing without meditation.

[1137] Thus, by the emanation-kaya that shows,
[1138] The unsurpassable secret mantra
[1139] Meaning was not spoken to some;
[1140] What was not spoken does not become spoken.
[1141] Though on occasion it becomes spoken,
[1142] Arhats, solitary realizers, and sutras,
[1143] Within which the name "lower vehicle" does not exist,
[1144] Become proclaimers of the unsurpassable vehicle.
[1145] Therefore hidden from others of inferior mind,
[1146] That person possessing those
[1147] Is considered the emanation-kaya of performing actions.

[1148] Thus it is spoken.

[1149] Although Great Completion may arise,
[1150] From up to the secretmost cycle of instructions of mind-vast and this instruction,
[1151] Know that this unsurpassable Heart Essence, not arising from the existence of the infinitely long path, is a very rare enumeration of Dharma.
[1152] Therefore, similar to a jewel, it should be held as a precious treasure.

[1153] In the Supreme Sutra:
[1154] Because arising is rare, because stainless,
[1155] Because possessing power, and because becoming
[1156] The ornament of the world—therefore jewel itself.

[1157] As thus spoken.

[1158] Fifth, the method of examining emanation-kaya:
[1159] Teaching Dharma with benefit and happiness to common beings,
