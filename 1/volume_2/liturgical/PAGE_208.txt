[8925] There is no obscuration from reversing inward.
[8926] Here, what tantra and instruction say exists in outer sky:
[8927] For now, said intentionally—when placing eye on outer sky condition, the portion seen and seeming to exist there.
[8928] Naturally, if it existed outside, others could also see it;
[8929] Know it does not exist outside.
[8930] That others do not see one's empty-form is due to body obscuration.
[8931] Self-seeing is like seeing sun-arisen appearance within the hole of seeing-arising through pure light-root's gap.
[8932] The proof: by seeing empty-forms with closed eyes, one knows they exist within.
[8933] Therefore, body-appearances etc. appear as if existing in outer fields, though not existing there—
[8934] Like face appearing when looking in mirror.
[8935] In the mirror of clear inner light-root,
[8936] That heart-awareness's face-like resonance-appearance
[8937] Arises from the portion of pure light-root's quality, seen within though not in field.
[8938] Outer and inner two portions mixing in mere appearance—delusions also, many are true.
[8939] Understanding manner thus, a person possessing wisdom, arisen from Great Perfection's expanse, is called
[8940] A yogin like myself of various self-liberation.
[8941] Joining these manners with confident scripture:
[8942] From the great Lion Power-Perfect Tantra:
[8943] All those body-appearances
[8944] Are not field-appearances.
[8945] Like a young girl
[8946] To the mirror's clear characteristic,
[8947] Seeing her own face appear—
[8948] To Dharma-nature's field-sky,
[8949] Awareness-appearance arises as body.
[8950] Seeing one's own location-condition
[8951] Does not exist in field.
[8952] Pure reference manifestly clear,
[8953] With one's own center and mandala.
[8954] Though wisdom-meaning has no field,
[8955] At sentient-being time, appears like field.
[8956] Great realization in seen field,
[8957] Great bliss in understood field,
[8958] Great experience in seen appearance,
[8959] Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.
