[4816] First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.
[4817] When this habituation arrives at measure—
[4818] Liberating with stone into light;
[4819] If not arrived, traverse bardo
[4820] Or nature-emanation field;
[4821] Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.
[4822] Thus introduce, and:
[4823] From Self-Arising Instruction:
[4824] Thus, whoever sees—this person,
[4825] First Samantabhadra,
[4826] Capacity itself is equal.
[4827] Thus said, and:
[4828] From Thalgyur:
[4829] Hanging-cord nature is:
[4830] By all conceptuality pure,
[4831] Base-buddha, not deluded.
[4832] Thus it was said.
[4833] Third: show vision's dawning manner from that:
[4834] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
[4835] Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
[4836] From first white-pure star-scatter like,
[4837] Point possessing five colors,
[4838] Each one,
[4839] Three-bind interval vision until that.
[4840] From previous:
[4841] Then see point.
[4842] Thus it was said.
[4843] That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
[4844] Inner conceptuality separate,
[4845] Equal limitless liberating;
[4846] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance,
[4847] And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
[4848] Two—outer-inner pair connect;
[4849] Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.
[4850] Third: vision four dawning sequence, two are:
[4851] Briefly show essence,
[4852] Extensively explain nature.
[4853] First: when all four visions,
[4854] Body abiding in posture,
[4855] Eye gazing at gaze manner,
[4856] Wind-awareness mode slow,
[4857] Three main-points harmonize.  Particularly: first two visions purify,  Later two not relying on effort,  Mode purify,  Liberate into luminous-clear,  Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual.  These main-points: arise from not doing—  Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point.  Explain that meaning:  Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable,  Base-abide and that resonance,  From light channel pure vision,  Like golden thread coil,  Curve interval point bind.  Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings,  Essence not existing good-bad,  Equal, unchanging,  Place in abiding part.
