[8729] When reaching the end, like a fetus liberated from the eggshell.
[8730] From Power-Perfect:
[8731] The awareness abiding in the base
[8732] Perfects the three bodies in wisdom-space.
[8733] Like a peacock egg,
[8734] Within, light-wisdom clearly demonstrated.
[8735] The awareness arising on the path
[8736] Is demonstrated like a rainbow.
[8737] The awareness delivering to the end
[8738] Is like peacock chicks
[8739] Breaking through and emerging.
[8740] Thus it is spoken.

[8741] Moreover, when wisdom is unripe, all open;
[8742] At the time of appearance, light;
[8743] At the time of familiarity, body-appearance.
[8744] From that:
[8745] From the space without elaboration,
[8746] Unobstructed luminosity contact arises.
[8747] At the time of appearance, light appears;
[8748] At the time of perfection, self-appearance.
[8749] At the time of familiarity, becomes body.
[8750] By wisdom-method relation,
[8751] See the five ultimate mandalas.
[8752] Thus it is spoken.

[8753] The characteristics of thus-abiding body, awareness, space, and wisdom:
[8754] From that same source:
[8755] The characteristic of body is thus:
[8756] Unchanging, clear,
[8757] Empty, and free of concepts.
[8758] The characteristic of awareness is thus:
[8759] Subtle, emanating,
[8760] Nadi-thread, and moving.
[8761] The characteristic of space is thus:
[8762] Vast, spontaneously thick, infinitely empty,
[8763] Clear, warm, cool,
[8764] Holding the nature of flexibility and movement,
[8765] Pervading, rim-wall.
[8766] The characteristic of wisdom is thus:
[8767] Arising, arisen, self-clear,
[8768] From, knowing, and realizing.
[8769] Clear, blazing, infinitely pervading,
[8770] Appearing, dark, opening,
[8771] The supreme wisdom of emptiness-clear—
[8772] These are considered the characteristics of secret mantra.
[8773] Thus it is spoken.

[8774] Second, the manner of lamp's location:
[8775] For gods, one cubit.
[8776] For demigods, four fingers.
[8777] For humans, one color-point.
[8778] For animals, self-clear.
[8779] For pretas, like a sesame seed.
[8780] For hell-beings, like a horse-hoof.
[8781] For Buddhas, immeasurable.
