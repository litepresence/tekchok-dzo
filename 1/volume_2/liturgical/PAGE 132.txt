[5650] Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow.
[5651] Joining knee and chest draws ability of wisdom from the body's elements.
[5652] Crossing the hands at armpit or atop the knee ends the limits of action and latency.

[5653] Second, the vital of resting wisdom:
[5654] If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:
[5655] Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched,
[5656] There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.
[5657] Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,
[5658] Mind abides inward.

[5659] Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.
[5660] Through that reversal, heat arises in the outer body,
[5661] Experience of unborn dharmata arises inward.

[5662] Embracing and stretching the nape with the hands
[5663] Reverses navel action-wind.
[5664] Through that reversal, many conceptualities cease inward,
[5665] Increasing fully pure wisdom vision outward.

[5666] Such vitals are:
[5667] Body vital is ability,
[5668] Channel vital is to wind,
[5669] Wind vital is to mind.

[5670] Regarding Sambhogakaya posture also:
[5671] Sound explanation:
[5672] "Great elephant" expresses from the part of power and great vehicle, for that body vital lifts special wisdom.

[5673] Dividing meaning, from the two:
[5674] The vital of setting continuity:
[5675] Sleeping face-covered makes power to overcome the three existences.
[5676] Joining knee and chest makes basis for delusion to dawn as wisdom.
[5677] Extending the big toe outward to earth harms moving action-wind.
[5678] Pressing hand fingers to earth
[5679] Supports dharmata manifestly dawning.
[5680] Raising the nape a little makes conceptuality dawn as wisdom.

[5681] Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[5682] Face-covering overcomes the existence of attachment-holding of three doors.
[5683] Placing four hands and feet to earth,
[5684] Pushing outward with the placed foot big-toe reverses conceptuality action-wind.
