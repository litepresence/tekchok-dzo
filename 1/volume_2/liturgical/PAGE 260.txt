Signs of yogin liberating and obtaining enlightenment, and showing signs of six beings taking birth through confusion.

Of the first, two aspects:
Brief showing of signs,
Extensive explanation.

Of the first:
Even meditating reality direct meaning, if diligence inferior, measure not reached. At time of separating solid-awareness with stone, signs of liberating from defilements without taking existence—complete buddhahood by great appearance of self-relics, sound, and light.

That also: Great Perfection's system has two buddha ways—complete buddha by appearing signs is nirvana with remainder, stone with residue; perfectly complete buddha by excellent diligence, pure stone with, is nirvana without aggregates' remainder.

From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror Tantra:

Nirvana that also two:
Perfectly complete buddha and
Complete buddha.

Of that, perfectly complete buddha is
Buddhahood without aggregates' remainder.

To complete buddha person,
Light and
Sound and
Relics and
Kaya and
Earth move etcetera arise, said.

From Blazing Relics:

Excellent wisdom-power person,
Elements dissolve to self-place
From confusion appearance this,
To essence result,
Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
Result becomes self-ground.
Thus outer signs,
What from nirvana,
To that kaya and relics and
Likewise light and sound and
Earth moves.

Second, extensive explanation—five:
Kaya, relics, light, sound, and earth move.

Of the first, essence, division, cause, place, and result.
