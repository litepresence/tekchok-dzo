From Thalgyur:
Also light of color five:
Vision boat-part only victory-banner;
Measure see field boat-only.

Thus said, and:
From Self-Arising Tantra:
Thus see self-face:
From upper joint finger-four,
Separate good-capacity person—
How possible enter samsara?

Whatever dawn form boat-part,
This accomplish emanation quality;
Whatever dawn only field see,
Same is heap;
Whatever is outer vision cease,

This also thus become.

Thus it was said.

And particular explain nature—two from:

Arise cause nirmanakaya fully purify purify;
Then: dawn each body self-only,
Arise cause nirmanakaya vision, dharmata direct see;
Then: those bodies become father-mother five five,
Itself sambhogakaya wisdom measure arrive;
Then: vision with individual heap mandala.
