[5565] Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.

[5566] This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:

[5567] When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[5568] Fingers and so forth appear thus.
[5569] Focusing this, elements naturally cease.

[5570] Through the difference of birth and entry,
[5571] Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[5572] Without holding anything whatsoever,
[5573] One abides—this is the emanation body.

[5574] Through this, the power of entry's force,
[5575] Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[5576] Also focusing upon that,
[5577] Again at times doing thus,
[5578] The self-sound of vision rustling,
[5579] Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.

[5580] Through this, doing all benefit for beings,
[5581] For awareness is equal and one,
[5582] The great transfer of three thousand
[5583] Beings is accomplished by this.

[5584] Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[5585] The body is accomplished by this.
[5586] All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.

[5587] All this, certain result,
[5588] Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.

[5590] Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[5591] Like the rungs of a ladder.
[5592] That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease;
[5593] From the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished.

[5594] Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself,
[5595] Especially sublime from the common vehicles,
[5596] Having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.

[5597] Upon that itself:

[5598] For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood,
[5599] If possessing this means, it is thus.
[5600] For other conduct is pride itself,
[5601] Not seeing entity.

[5602] Therefore this is all rare words—
[5603] Always look to this jewel treasure.

[5605] Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.
