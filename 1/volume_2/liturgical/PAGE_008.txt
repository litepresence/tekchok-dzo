[390] Those transcendence-indicating dharmas
[391] Abide completely in body-mind,
[392] Up to thus stated.
[393] Third, awareness completeness manner:
[394] Again from that:
[395] In whatever self-appearing awareness's face,
[396] All however-appearing dharmas are complete.
[397] Thus stated; and
[398] Thus in awareness itself:
[399] Sun and moon: method and wisdom;
[400] Male: base, female: path;
[401] Planet: realization measure, star: dharma;
[402] Cloud: compassion pervading all;
[403] Tree: dharmata-expanding path;
[404] Mountain: view without change;
[405] Rock: dharmakaya free from birth and destruction;
[406] Root: all dharmas' one cause;
[407] Branch: awakening's branch itself;
[408] Trunk: one taste in emptiness;
[409] Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu;
[410] Flower: wisdom's lamp itself;
[411] Fruit: three kayas self-complete.
[412] Sound: dharmata-field's sound;
[413] Smell: buddha-speech's fame;
[414] Taste: experience's bliss taste;
[415] Touch: great concentration;
[416] Music: five's complete mandala;
[417] Canopy: clear color's potential;
[418] Parasol: protecting wisdom;
[419] Upper-canopy: instruction's great essential point;
[420] Banner: manifest realization's buddha;
[421] All dharmas in mind-itself's face
[422] Abide in primordial spontaneous completion's manner.
[423] Therefore, mind and entity dharmas
[424] Are all merely imputed.
[425] Thus.
[426] Second meaning: inner-arising extensive explanation—two:
[427] Common divisions and
[428] Individual divisions' nature.
[429] First:
[430] Inner-arising: essence's five-arising inwardly rely upon body's five coarse arising;
[431] Wind and
[432] Fire and
[433] Earth and
[434] Water and
[435] Space—five, each abiding as five, twenty-five limbs.
[436] Thus, definite suitability: definite as five, depending on five different functions;
[437] From the Self-Arisen:
[438] The five great arising are complete in one's own body.
[439] That also: five winds make wisdom-potential;
[440] Five fires make wisdom-potency;
[441] Five earths make wisdom-essence;
[442] Five waters make wisdom-object;
[443] Five spaces make wisdom-abode. Thus.
[444] Second, five:
