Possessing retinue, enjoyment, always self-power prosperity, etc.

Where to be born in next life depends on present thought-conduct good and not-good. Those who exercise gathering accumulations, giving, morality, etc., take birth in happy-path high realms, high with retinue and prosperity. Those abiding in patience, integrity, etc., with beautiful form, doing army-friend and protector-shelter, take birth in land center. Honored by all, taking birth without harm from others. Respecting master before, exercising in dharma, now meeting proper master virtuous friend, exercising in dharma, taking birth in good land with desires. Those offering with respect to three jewels before, here also good complete going-forth, ordination complete, reaching end of pure conduct life, exercising holy vehicle dharma. Those trained in hearing, thinking, meditation before, here also great wisdom, hearing, thinking, meditation in door of dharma arrangements without measure, spontaneously accomplishing self and other's two purposes—immeasurable qualities.

Those who did evil non-virtuous karma before, here also birth in various negative paths; obtaining high realms yet incomplete faculties, etc., poor, born with small merit. Here also exercising non-virtue, later too born in suffering-possessing race.

In short: knowing present pleasure-pain and body-mind form by what done in before-life; where to go later depends on present thought-conduct. From Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:

Look at present body for what done before;
Look at present mind for where to go later—thus.

Thus thinking, also abandon non-virtue, accomplish virtue, always remain mind in holy dharma.
