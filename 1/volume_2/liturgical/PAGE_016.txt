[807] [807] Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[808] [808] Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[809] [809] Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[810] [810] Moreover from that same nature:
[811] [811] Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] [812] This is dharmakaya's conduct.
[813] [813] Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] [814] This is dharmakaya's meditation.
[815] [815] Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] [816] This is dharmakaya's view.
[817] [817] Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] [818] This is dharmakaya's fruition.
[819] [819] Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] [820] This is dharmakaya's enlightened activity.
[821] [821] One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] [822] These are dharmakaya's excellence-qualities.
[823] [823] Thus it is spoken.
[824] [824] Second: Sambhogakaya's basis—five expansive explanations:
[825] [825] Essence,
[826] [826] Definitive meaning,
[827] [827] Characteristics,
[828] [828] Appearance mode,
[829] [829] Abiding mode—thus.
[830] [830] First: Essence—from Rangshar:
[831] [832] Birth exists, yet death-free, possessing vajra,
[832] [833] Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear,
[833] [834] Possessing five fathers, five fields, five clusters,
[834] [835] Possessing five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations,
[835] [836] Possessing five bases, five paths, five fruitions,
[836] [837] Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[837] [838] This is sambhogakaya's complete essence.
[838] [839] Thus it is spoken.
[839] [840] Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[840] [841] In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered.
[841] [843] From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[842] [844] Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[843] [845] Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[844] [846] In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear.
[845] [847] Thus it is spoken.
[846] [848] Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, green.
[847] [853] Five kayas:
[848] [854] Essence-expanse kaya,
[849] [855] Unchanging vajra-kaya,
[850] [856] Dharmakaya,
[851] [857] Sambhogakaya,
[852] [858] Nirmanakaya—five.
[853] [859] Five fathers:
[854] [860] Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.
