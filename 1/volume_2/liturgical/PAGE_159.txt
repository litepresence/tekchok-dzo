[6740] Direct face-introduction of copper-shining awareness through dharma-exhaustion and mind-transcendence:
[6741] Maintain the intention of self-clear nature-abiding in great pervasion-expansion,
[6742] Place the three vital points of dharmata's wheel in the great sky-equal space-clarity.

[6743] First:
[6744] Just place self-settled awareness in self-clarity,
[6745] Not sending outward,
[6746] Not gathering inward,
[6747] Look at self-nature without thinking in-between—
[6748] Outer, inner, and middle: non-existent;
[6749] Self-clear foundation:
[6750] Dharmakaya not confused by view-meditation,
[6751] Primordial wisdom not moved by concepts,
[6752] Intention not fabricated by elaboration-gathering;
[6753] In clarity: thought non-existent;
[6754] In abiding: grasping non-existent;
[6755] In vastness: losing non-existent;
[6756] In equality: interval non-existent.

[6757] Great self-tone without entering-maker;
[6758] Great great intention self-settled from primordial time:
[6759] Tone and empty like ocean,
[6760] Clear and pure like sun and moon,
[6761] Vast and pervading like sky,
[6762] Stable and abiding like king of mountains.

[6763] This meaning and all beings: though existing primordially in self, not experiencing separation even for a moment,
[6764] Yet through face-not-knowing, mixed in samsara by bad thought elaborations—
[6765] Now, through lama's instruction identifying, whether dawning or dwelling or whatever, just as face-introduction to self-settled place nature, make only nature-not-wandering.

[6766] From Lion Perfection:
[6767] E ma: path that lion crosses not;
[6768] Lion of action-effort non-existent:
[6769] To white snow of release-place non-existent,
[6770] Powers three of cleared darkness perfect.

[6771] I, lion of thought-non-existent tone:
[6772] To good snow of primordial purity, stain-not,
[6773] Powers three of cleared element perfect.

[6774] Thus said, and:
[6775] From Six Spaces:
[6776] To mind-itself of permanent-cease non-existent:
[6777] Appearance of separation from good-bad:
[6778] Intention of separation from abandon-accept—
[6779] I, Samantabhadra, show.

[6780] To mind-itself of accept-reject non-existent:
[6781] Appearance of self-liberation direction-non-existent—
[6782] Intention of great pervasion-expansion—
[6783] I, Samantabhadra, show.

[6784] To mind-itself of dull-excitement non-existent:
[6785] Meditation of great release-equal—
[6786] Intention of six aggregates spontaneous—
[6787] I, Samantabhadra, show.

[6788] To mind-itself of concern non-existent:
[6789] Appearance of separation from hope-doubt—
[6790] Intention of primordial place, confidence-possessing—
[6791] I, Samantabhadra, show.

[6792] Thus said.
