[7672] A-li-ka's fruit, primordially ripened—
[7673] Now ripening cause not-existing, like.
[7674] Ye-grol having three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7675] Ye-grol's understanding: not adventitious, from beginning liberated-finished. Now again liberating cause not-existing's essence—rig-pa itself from delusion not-experienced arisen.
[7676] Ye-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by establishment, scripture by establishment, logical-reason by establishment.
[7677] Reason by establishment: ye-from rig-pa itself liberated's essence. Rig-pa to basis not-existing, returning-place not. Root not-existing, arising-place not. Characteristics not-existing, certainty not-reached. Birth not-existing, liberating cause not-existing.
[7678] That also as ye-grol sign: meditation-accomplishment whatsoever by characteristics seeing not. That also cause-effect sequence-not's reason by established. Rig-pa to continuum not-existing, result not—karma and ripening existing not-possible.
[7679] Scripture by establishment: From Brtson-pa-don-ldan:
[7680] */ Mind itself ye-from liberated,
[7681] */ Outside from liberated condition how possible?
[7682] Thus.
[7683] Logical-reason by establishment: gtad-yal-rag-gzhag's logical-reason by accomplished. Gtad-pa ye-from liberated, that itself self-place liberated—ye-from liberated because.
[7684] That also: mind from arising-place not-existing, abiding-place not-existing, going-place not-existing's essence—ye-from liberated known.
[7685] Liberation-manner: mind empty is liberation called, or not-liberated called convention-only not-designatable. Ye-from liberated-finished's sign: now that to again liberate not-needed—mind ye-from buddha-ed.
[7686] Ye-from liberated that to: liberating cause not-existing known.
[7687] Second rang-grol: relying upon antidote not-existing's essence, lama's instruction dependent all shown.
[7688] Thus: appearing-sounding dharmas all, arisen also self from arisen...
