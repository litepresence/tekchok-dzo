Of the second meaning, particular explanation of main signs—two aspects:
General showing of common view-meditation signs;
Particular explanation of direct clear-light signs.

Of the first:
View free of extremes, trained like sky, going through sky, circumambulating Jambudvipa in an instant;
Solid things dissolving when gazed upon.

Meditation of self-settled clarity, trained samadhi, wondrous signs of body, speech, and mind arise.

From Blazing Relics:

Signs of familiarity with view:
Upon the fortunate person,
These likewise arise.
Because emptiness expands body and mind,
Like dakinis in sky,
Turning self-control over wind,
Able to travel all Jambudvipa
In six hundred instants like wind,
Because own-mind realizes emptiness,
Able to dissolve whatever is gazed upon.
This gains great confidence in view.

Signs of training in meditation:
No insects on body,
Because compassion completes other benefit,
Because concept mind-continuum is empty,
Body becomes like cotton,
Because awareness possesses deathless meaning,
Body becomes like sixteen years passed.
Because reality moisture pervades mind,
Hair becomes oily.
Thus mind does not wander,
Sits where placed,
Cannot enter confusion objects.
This gains meditation oneself,
Obtains buddhahood in two lives.

These are certain signs of conceptual object beings.

Of the second, particular explanation of direct clear-light signs—five aspects:
Light, expanse, bindu, kaya, and awareness trained to measure.

Of the first, light—five aspects:
Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.

Light's essence shows awareness tone.
