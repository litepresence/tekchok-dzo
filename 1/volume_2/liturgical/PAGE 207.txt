[8880] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8881] That self-appearing awareness-thing
[8882] Abides in wisdom's nadi-thread.
[8883] Like swift-flying winged ones
[8884] Going everywhere in mere moments,
[8885] When reached by arrow,
[8886] Becomes like swift deer.
[8887] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8888] Like bees circling nectar.
[8889] Then, when looking at self-appearance,
[8890] It abides like a mirage.
[8891] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8892] Becomes only movement or fluttering.
[8893] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8894] Becomes sinking and blazing.
[8895] Therefore, when looking very carefully,
[8896] See light-appearance without going or coming.
[8897] When stable in that meaning,
[8898] See the bindu-empty lamp.
[8899] When truly looking at that,
[8900] See bindu with body.
[8901] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8902] Delusion-appearances become seen as enjoyment-body.
[8903] All those body-appearances
[8904] Are like illusion-rainbow.
[8905] Becoming thoroughly stable in that,
[8906] Day and night without—
[8907] Like the eye of a vixen,
[8908] Without day and night.
[8909] Self-appearing mandala is thus.
[8910] Thus it is spoken.

[8911] Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light bindu-bodies etc.
[8912] Are widely said to exist in outer intermediate space, and
[8913] One holds that they exist there,
[8914] But this is error, not thus.
[8915] All exist within the clear light-root of the inner body.
[8916] By the clarity of eye's light-root, one sees empty-forms inwardly.
[8917] Moreover, the heart's resonance-root pervading all and emanating
[8918] Is now the time of base-appearance arising.
[8919] Knowing self-face and clearly placing in self-glow,
[8920] Going increasingly clear,
[8921] When wind-mind pure, seeing what spontaneous appearance is within body, when entering within as power-base dissolves,
[8922] Reaching measure, goes to cease.
[8923] When setting again, base-appearance dissolves into base, liberating into primordial purity,
[8924] When that appearance appears to expand, expanding without self-characteristic.
