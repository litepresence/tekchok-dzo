[2573] Who meditates union-bliss—

[2574] By this makes sense-objects the path.

[2575] Who makes intermediate-space the path—

[2576] By this obtains power over mind.

[2577] Thus it is.

[2578] Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, the method of holding mind upon the five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch:

[2579] From the Thalgyur:

[2580] Eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch.

[2581] Train upon the ground of the five sense-objects, and—

[2582] Forms—face-shapes and forms, and—

[2583] Arts and illusions, different, and—

[2584] Eye-magic, etc.—various.

[2585] Sounds—lute, vase-drum, and—

[2586] Stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and—

[2587] Pheng, har, etc.

[2588] Smells—fragrance joined, and—

[2589] Do through pleasing dependent-arising profound.

[2590] Tastes—molasses with six, and—

[2591] Grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed.

[2592] Dependent-arising branches joined.

[2593] Touch—skilled one sits upon throne.

[2594] Scriptures mixed, joined elements, and—

[2595] By means of some tree leaves,

[2596] By touch alone upon dharmata,

[2597] Dwells with non-separated mind.

[2598] Thus it is.

[2599] Especially, the stages of making the four elements yoga:

[2600] From that is spoken:

[2601] The training stage of the three kayas itself,

[2602] Making the qualities of elements chief, and—

[2603] Supreme—earth, water, fire, wind.

[2604] Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished.

[2605] Upon explanation of water's sound,

[2606] Holds dakini's sound-melody.

[2607] If always familiarized with this,

[2608] Certainly accomplishes emanation-body.

[2609] Earth's sound—cool and heavy,

[2610] Possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice.

[2611] If always hearing-training upon this,

[2612] Certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body.

[2613] Fire's sound—self-made, trained.

[2614] Shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody.

[2615] Who practices hearing upon this,

[2616] Certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities.

[2617] Wind's sound—cutting, resounding,

[2618] Garuda king's practice-speech.

[2619] If knowing this always reciting,

[2620] Common training of three kayas.

[2621] Thus, the sound-meaning of four elements,

[2622] Certainly apply to outer times.

[2623] Winter, spring, summer, autumn—

[2624] Water, earth, fire, wind—

[2625] Apply certainly to sequence of times, and—

[2626] If made suited to yoga body,

[2627] Accomplishment—without doubt in this.

[2628] Thus it is.

[2629] Thus, summarizing the meaning of gods' and humans' mind-holding.
