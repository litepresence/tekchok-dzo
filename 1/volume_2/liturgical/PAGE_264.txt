[11437] Brief show by common division,
[11438] Extensive explanation by special division,
[11439] Concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels.
[11440] Of the first:
[11441] Generally all beings buddhas primordially, dwell as wisdom five nature individually and not individually, five relics not ripe as latency existing for holding that kaya race and life. Yogin trains clear-light essence path, ripens manifestly.
[11442] Five ringsel etcetera arising, liberating race separately.
[11443] From Blazing Relics:
[11444] To supreme person nirvana,
[11445] All buddhas' relics arise.
[11446] From buddha race distinction,
[11447] Relics race five-five arise.
[11448] Ringsel thus-gone relics,
[11449] Likewise called ringsel,
[11450] Is vajra race relics.
[11451] Ringsel jewel,
[11452] Ringsel lotus,
[11453] Likewise called ringsel,
[11454] Is action race relics.
[11455] That also: from five relics races to person, whatever arises one or all complete, to five race mass appearance, relics race is sign of liberating as that buddha.
[11456] From that:
[11457] Method-possess nirvana,
[11458] Body this all arises.
[11459] If individual race relics arise,
[11460] Also in reality bardo,
[11461] See buddha of individual race,
[11462] Liberate.
[11463] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[11464] Relics also five:
[11465] Dark-blue color, Vairocana field complete buddha;
[11466] White color, Vajrasattva;
[11467] Yellow color, Ratnasambhava;
[11468] Red color, Amitabha;
[11469] Green color, Amoghasiddhi;
[11470] Various colors, reached ground of spontaneously accomplishing five kayas.
[11471] Second, special division—color of five relics races, measure of big-small, distinction of place, from what cause arises—four.
