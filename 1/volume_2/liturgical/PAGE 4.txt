[173] Connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction.
[174] Wind-characteristic, making lifting,
[175] Connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction.
[176] Fire-characteristic, making burning,
[177] Connects with awareness-wisdom gone under afflictions' authority.
[178] Water-characteristic, making moistening,
[179] Connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects.
[180] Space-characteristic, vastness,
[181] Connects with awareness-characteristic without break in continuity—thus it is said.
[182] Eighth, the manner of the five-arising's liberation:
[183] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[184] Space itself, by pervading emptiness,
[185] Space itself liberates as entity.
[186] Wind, by appearing without graspable object,
[187] Liberates into entity-gathering's function.
[188] Fire, by consuming what ripens,
[189] Liberates by moving and separating clear from impure.
[190] Earth, when making the producer lift,
[191] Liberates into limitless empty non-entity.
[192] Water, by moistening what gathers,
[193] Liberates into burning-ripening's function.
[194] Thus.
[195] Explaining divisions:
[196] Each of the five-arising—earth of earth, and so forth—five sets of five;
[197] Enumeration of portions: twenty-five.
[198] Again from That Very:
[199] Space's wind toward entity,
[200] Space's fire makes gathering,
[201] Space's water makes burning,
[202] Space's earth opens opportunity,
[203] Space's space appears.
[204] Wind's wind toward stability,
[205] Wind's space: great sound-potential,
[206] Wind's water: great quickness and speed,
[207] Wind's fire: great projection and gathering,
[208] Wind's earth: clear form-reflection.
[209] Water's water: sound-echo,
[210] Water's space: without obstruction,
[211] Water's wind: flows attachment-free,
[212] Water's fire: makes gathering,
[213] Water's earth: makes pervading.
[214] Fire's earth: makes producing,
[215] Fire's space: burns entity,
[216] Fire's wind: makes blazing,
[217] Fire's water: makes destroying,
[218] Fire's earth: holds.
[219] Earth's earth: pervades migrators,
[220] Earth's space: the mahayana,
[221] Earth's wind: makes snow-empty,
[222] Earth's water: produces entity,
[223] Earth's fire: dries.
[224] Thus.
[225] By training in these distinctions, distinguished qualities; each accomplished. In that commentary it is explained—
