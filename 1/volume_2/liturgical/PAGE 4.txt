[173] Connects with awareness wisdom free from birth and destruction.
[174] The characteristic of wind making lifting also
[175] Connects with awareness wisdom without obstruction.
[176] The characteristic of fire making burning also
[177] Connects with awareness wisdom gone under the authority of afflictions.
[178] The characteristic of water making moistening also
[179] Connects with awareness wisdom entering all objects.
[180] The characteristic of space being vast also
[181] Should be connected with awareness characteristic without break in continuity, thus stated.
[182] Eighth, the manner of liberation of the five elements:
[183] From the Mutik Trengwa:
[184] Space itself, by pervading emptiness,
[185] Space itself liberates as entity.
[186] Wind, by appearing without graspable object,
[187] Liberates into the function of gathering entity.
[188] Fire, by consuming what ripens,
[189] Liberates by moving and separating clear from impure.
[190] Earth, when making lifting of producer,
[191] Liberates into limitless empty non-entity.
[192] Water, by moistening what gathers,
[193] Liberates into the function of ripening what burns.
[194] Thus.
[195] Explaining divisions:
[196] Each of the five elements—earth of earth, etcetera—five sets of five;
[197] Enumeration of portions: twenty-five.
[198] Again from That Very [Source]:
[199] Space's wind toward entity,
[200] Space's fire makes gathering,
[201] Space's water makes burning,
[202] Space's earth opens opportunity,
[203] Space's space appears.
[204] Wind's wind toward stability,
[205] Wind's space great sound-potential,
[206] Wind's water great quickness and speed,
[207] Wind's fire great projection and gathering,
[208] Wind's earth clear form-reflection.
[209] Water's water is sound-echo,
[210] Water's space without obstruction,
[211] Water's wind flows attachment-free,
[212] Water's fire makes gathering,
[213] Water's earth makes pervading.
[214] Fire's earth makes producing,
[215] Fire's space burns entity,
[216] Fire's wind makes blazing,
[217] Fire's water makes destroying,
[218] Fire's earth holds.
[219] Earth's earth pervades migrators,
[220] Earth's space is the Mahayana,
[221] Earth's wind makes snow-empty,
[222] Earth's water produces entity,
[223] Earth's fire dries.
[224] Thus.
[225] Training in the distinctions of these, distinguished qualities each accomplish; in that commentary it is explained, and
