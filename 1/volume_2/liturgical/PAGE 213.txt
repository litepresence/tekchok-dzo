[9143] As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[9144] Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[9145] At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[9146] Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.

[9147] Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[9148] The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within.
[9149] Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.

[9150] From Six Expanses:
[9151] Pressing the bodily posture,
[9152] Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
[9153] Likewise, eyes to the space between,
[9154] By elephant gaze
[9155] Place in great spreading without memory.
[9156] Thus cast awareness to sky.
[9157] Without separating from this,
[9158] The yogin who meditates continuously
[9159] Expands appearances by day.
[9160] At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,
[9161] To hold the measure of four equal times,
[9162] Gathering sense doors oneself,
[9163] To the lamp of empty bindu,
[9164] The endowed yogin places mind.
[9165] When that bindu expands,
[9166] Place consciousness expanding as well.
[9167] When bindu becomes subtle,
[9168] Bindu increasingly subtle,
[9169] Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
[9170] By essential point of sleep and dream,
[9171] Extract root of former attachment habits.
[9172] Thus in all times of night,
[9173] The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
[9174] By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
[9175] Thus it is spoken.

[9176] Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[9177] Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.

[9178] From that same source:
[9179] By body, field, and awareness,
[9180] Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.
[9181] Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
[9182] Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
[9183] At the time of ceasing that,
[9184] Awareness reaches the measure.
[9185] When thus reaching the measure,
[9186] One's own body also does not appear.
[9187] The flesh-blood body produced by elements
[9188] Because elements are pure in their own place,
[9189] Because this appears as field,
[9190] The mind-body grasped by delusion
[9191] Because elements dissolve in their own place,
[9192] This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
[9193] The light-body grasped by awareness
[9194] Is like the water-moon mandala.
[9195] At this time, near Dharma-nature cessation,
[9196] Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
[9197] Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
[9198] Obtain the action-free perfect body.
[9199] At this time, all limits of body
[9200] Are near to freedom.
[9201] The yogin familiar with the base
[9202] Also empties one's own place.
[9203] The yogin familiar with the path
[9204] Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
[9205] Whoever is familiar with the fruit
[9206] Reaches the non-return ground by this.
[9207] Thus it is spoken.

[9208] Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samadhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye,
