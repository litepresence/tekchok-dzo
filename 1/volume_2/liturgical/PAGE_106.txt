By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
This same, certain.
Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body;
By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.

That also: three-eyes gaze,
Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
Equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point.
Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.

What is three gaze manners' determination?
Lazy one: sambhogakaya;
Diligent one: nirmanakaya;
Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious;
Therefore three determined.

Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata,
Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
Mode: liberating from samsara.

Second, field's main-point:
Outer dhatu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
Inner dhatu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
Dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.

From Thalgyur:
Dhatu: outer and inner;
Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
When dust and rain removed,
Press direct main-point, expert,
Make inner lamp the path.

Thus it was said.

That also: outer awareness dawning field;
Inner: experience increasing field.
Awareness and experience, from two not existing,
Called samsara-nirvana mixed.

That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—
Gaze at field, not liberate.
First: not desire vision dawn;
Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like,
Knowing also compatible with that arises,
Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
