From Blazing Lamp:
Dhatu makes awareness's self-field;
Vajra itself is hanging-cord;
Make place this inside.

Thus it was said.

Fruit is:
When outer dhatu-vision, eye not moving, self time;
Inner: awareness abiding in base,
Cause resonance to dissolve from self, circle;
Separate lung wind horse cause;
Wisdom sky dissolves into dhatu sky,
Cause equal limitless liberation;
Pure awareness, not moving in dhatu,
Abides in nature of luminous-clear intent,
Heart-in mode.

That yogin: called capturing original dharmata luminous-clear,
From samsara name empty,
Three-realms corpse cut is.

From Thalgyur:
That dharmata direct main-point:
Know by seeing only,
And realize by that knowing,
Become liberate by realizing only.
Liberate called: not untie.

Sky in sky,
Dissolve nature not-aim cause,
Equal limitless, not possessing part.

Capacity-possess find direct:
Three-realms samsara name empty cause,
Three-realms corpse cut.

Thus it was said.

Second: from two—experience increasing above vision:
Briefly show:
Above above purify dhatu awareness cause;
Outer: like non-dual abiding of awareness hanging-cord in dhatu-vision;
Inner: non-dual abiding of awareness dhatu,
Self-resonance in pure empty dhatu,
Cause luminous-clear mother-son mix;
Experience vision increases various.

From Thalgyur:
Experience vision increasing above is:
From wisdom color outer emerge,
Up-stand and wing dawn,
Various points, body itself,
Clear in coarse vision field.

Thus it was said.

Extensively explain:
Two are experience called experience increasing above—
Knowing experience,
And vision experience.

Knowing experience: worldly knowing experience,
Samadhi-obtained pleasure happiness,
Mind desiring song, dance, etcetera,
Heart desire.
