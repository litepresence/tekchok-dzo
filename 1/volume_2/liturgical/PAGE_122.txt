[5285] From the Thal 'gyur:

[5286] The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[5287] Direct objective visions cease,
[5288] The vision of earth and stones melts away,
[5289] Self-knowing enters into everything,
[5290] Inert things move when directed,
[5291] The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[5292] The body's dust-particles become visible.

[5293] Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[5294] From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[5295] The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[5296] All within the round periphery—
[5297] The yogin's body also luminous,
[5298] Appearing to go, come, and sit.
[5299] All is awareness arriving at its measure.

[5301] Second:

[5302] Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A, five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.

[5303] Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.

[5304] From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.

[5305] Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.

[5306] Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.

[5307] In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.

[5308] In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[5309] Emanations taming beings,
[5310] Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.

[5311] Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and
[5312] The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.

[5313] Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya.

[5314] The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[5315] The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
