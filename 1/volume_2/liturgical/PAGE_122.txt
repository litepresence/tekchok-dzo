[5285] [5285] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5286] [5286] The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[5287] [5287] Direct objective visions cease,
[5288] [5288] The vision of earth and stones melts away,
[5289] [5289] Self-knowing enters into everything,
[5290] [5290] Inert things move when directed,
[5291] [5291] The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[5292] [5292] The body's dust-particles become visible.
[5293] [5293] Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[5294] [5294] From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[5295] [5295] The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[5296] [5296] All within the round periphery—
[5297] [5297] The yogin's body also luminous,
[5298] [5298] Appearing to go, come, and sit.
[5299] [5299] All is awareness arriving at its measure.
[5300] [5301] Second:
[5301] [5302] Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A, five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.
[5302] [5303] Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.
[5303] [5304] From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.
[5304] [5305] Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.
[5305] [5306] Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.
[5306] [5307] In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.
[5307] [5308] In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[5308] [5309] Emanations taming beings,
[5309] [5310] Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.
[5310] [5311] Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and
[5311] [5312] The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.
[5312] [5313] Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya.
[5313] [5314] The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[5314] [5315] The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
