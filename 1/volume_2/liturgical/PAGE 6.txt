[265] Projecting wind's moving portion—
[266] Self-aware awakening, great bliss.
[267] Five-arising cause's seed
[268] Arises, appearing from emptiness-field.
[269] Two's bliss equipoise
[270] Is wisdom itself arisen from method.
[271] Womb-belly entering
[272] Is self-awareness arising from base.
[273] Seven seven-sets' realization measure.
[274] Ten months' grounds traversing.
[275] Birth itself is kaya-arising.
[276] Producing body is base-appearing field.
[277] Body-abiding is the base.
[278] Aging is delusion's confusion-awakening.
[279] Sickness itself is realization-confidence.
[280] By death, liberation into dharmata-emptiness.
[281] Thus all appearing beings
[282] Are primordially liberated without effort.
[283] Thus.
[284] Connecting with delusion-reversing particular manner:
[285] Birth is awareness moving from expanse's portion.
[286] Body is the base.
[287] Outer-appearing portion is base-appearing spontaneous completion.
[288] Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face.
[289] Aging is truth-clinging's confusion-awakening.
[290] Death, when knowing self-face, shows final arrival at primordial purity's ground in inner expanse's portion.
[291] By these arising primordially, instruction introduction and
[292] Empowerment,
[293] Liberation through meditation—suitable.
[294] If complete in partial similarity, not able to liberate through instruction;
[295] By clearly showing that partial similarity exists, buddha's dharma it is called.
[296] Existing in base-path's primordial measure,
[297] What becomes shown as symbol-meaning by buddha's speaking also arrives at this essence.
[298] Second, explaining body-mind completeness manner in particular—threefold:
[299] Body,
[300] Mind,
[301] Awareness completeness manner.
[302] First:
[303] In this four-arising gathered aggregate, outer container-world's portion and
[304] Inner essence-migrants' portions—all complete.
[305] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[306] Earth, water, fire, wind,
[307] Space, sun, and moon,
[308] Born males and females' forms,
[309] Planets, stars, and clouds,
[310] Trees, mountains, and rocks,
[311] Roots, trunks, and branches,
[312] Leaves, flowers, and fruits,
[313] Smells, tastes, sounds, and touches.
