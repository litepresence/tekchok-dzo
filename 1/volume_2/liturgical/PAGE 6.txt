[265] The moving portion of the projecting wind—
[266] Self-aware awakening, great bliss.
[267] The seed from the cause of five elements
[268] Arises appearing from the field of emptiness.
[269] The equipoise of bliss of the two
[270] Is wisdom itself arisen from method.
[271] Entering into the womb's belly
[272] Is self-awareness arising from the base.
[273] The measure of realization in seven sets of seven.
[274] Traversing the grounds in ten months.
[275] Birth itself is arising as kaya.
[276] Producing body is base-appearing field.
[277] Abiding in body is the base.
[278] Aging is the awakening of delusion's confusion.
[279] Sickness itself is confidence of realization.
[280] By death, liberation into Dharma-nature empty.
[281] Thus all appearing sentient beings,
[282] Primordially liberated without effort.
[283] Thus.
[284] Connecting with the particular manner of reversing delusion:
[285] Birth is the portion of awareness moving from dimension.
[286] Body is the base.
[287] Outer appearing portion is base-appearing spontaneous completion.
[288] Sickness is realization of meeting face-to-face.
[289] Aging is the awakening of confusion of truth-clinging.
[290] Death, when knowing self-face, shows the portion of final arrival at the ground of primordial purity in inner dimension.
[291] By these arising primordially, instruction introduction and
[292] Empowerment and
[293] Liberation through meditation are suitable.
[294] If primordially complete in partial similarity, not able to liberate through instruction;
[295] By clearly showing that partial similarity exists, it is called the Buddha's Dharma.
[296] Existing in the primordial measure of base-path,
[297] What becomes shown as symbol-meaning by Buddha's speaking also arrives at this essence.
[298] Second, explaining in particular the manner of completeness in body and mind—threefold:
[299] Body,
[300] Mind,
[301] The manner of completeness in awareness.
[302] First:
[303] In this aggregate of four gathered elements, the outer container-world portion and
[304] The inner essence-migrators portions all are complete.
[305] From the Mutik Trengwa:
[306] Earth, water, fire, and wind,
[307] Space, sun, and moon,
[308] Forms of born males and females,
[309] Planets, stars, and clouds,
[310] Trees, mountains, and rocks,
[311] Roots, trunks, and branches,
[312] Leaves, flowers, and fruits,
[313] Smells, tastes, sounds, and touches.
