[6996] Mind non-existent: sleep and faint,
[6997] Absorption entering: two,
[6998] Always perception non-existent.

[6999] Thus it is said.

[7000] Briefly gathered:
[7001] This desiring appearance as mind—great darkness of wrong thought—needs clearing.

[7002] Third: instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata self-place liberated:
[7003] Outer five objects non-existent empty self-pure like water moon: purify not needed;
[7004] Inner mind memory thought self-dissolve track-non-existent: destroy not by effort exertion two antidotes;
[7005] Appearance mind primordially liberated spontaneous: abandon-accept superimpose not needed.

[7006] To naked copper-shining awareness: not putting elaboration garment, complete complete complete, track-non-existent equal great, releasing inside—
[7007] Enter freeing to self-arisen primordial tone of five doors.
[7008] That also: burst awareness foundation naked, self-clear essence inner,
[7009] From that nature: know as self-tone of self-arisen primordial wisdom, distinguish-non-existent whatever dawns of memory thought good bad, not follow track.

[7010] Appearance mind rough not rough,
[7011] Clear not clear,
[7012] In this that manner, releasing to vast pervasion—self-dawn in Samantabhadra's intention space.

[7013] From Six Spaces:
[7014] Great self-appearance of all beings;
[7015] Place not existent for search from other;
[7016] By self power, self-knowing—

[7019] Action object of all worlds:
[7020] That itself to appearance nature,
[7021] See not-existent by whoever—
[7022] Bliss field of appearance nature.
[7023] By yogi meditating this:
[7024] Body of I, Samantabhadra,
[7025] This one possessing fortune sees.

[7026] Thus said, and:
[7027] Also:
[7028] When self-dawning condition thought to object,
[7029] Knowing this all nature non-existent—
[7030] All appearances illusion or
[7031] Like dream and reflection,
[7032] Great reflection experience not-thinking—
[7033] That dawning in whoever's continuum:
[7034] All appearances thunder,
[7035] Appearance condition not dawning to continuum,
[7036] Obtain outward-not-returning samadhi.

[7037] Thus said, and:
