[4673] Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
[4674] From Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
[4675] Thus body, etcetera—
[4676] By fully pressing all main-points,
[4677] Awareness itself and directly,
[4678] From guru's instruction, know.
[4679] Thus said, and:
[4680] From Thalgyur:
[4681] Relying upon actual main, self mind,
[4682] Body main-point and speech and also,
[4683] Relying upon mind main-point,
[4684] Making wind somehow slow,
[4685] Arising from fully projecting,
[4686] Body and mind connection cut that,
[4687] Not reversing even in three realms.
[4688] Thus said, and:
[4689] Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
[4690] Field: separate from obscuration-doer;
[4691] Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.
[4692] Thus it was said.
[4693] Second: from three main-points—gate,
[4694] Field,
[4695] And wind-awareness.
[4696] First: wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner;
[4697] Train in three bodies' gaze manners.
[4698] From Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
[4699] By dharmakaya gaze manner,
[4700] Press and extract three-realms' samsara;
[4701] Sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground;
[4702] Nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field.
[4703] Thus said, and:
[4704] From Letterless:
[4705] Gaze eye at sky element.
[4706] Thus said, and:
[4707] From Secret Sound Tantra:
[4708] Lower, reverse, corner—three;
[4709] Gaze manner types three, famous.
[4710] Thus it was said.
[4711] That also: nirmanakaya, lower, buddha, looking at disciples;
[4712] Sambhogakaya, corner look, buddha, looking at field-realm;
[4713] Dharmakaya, reverse, buddha, looking at base.
[4714] Yogin with bad eye faculty:
[4715] Harmonizing with nirmanakaya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists.
[4716] Eye possessing fault:
[4717] Harmonizing with sambhogakaya, eye clear purpose exists.
[4718] Eye faculty good:
[4719] Harmonizing with dharmakaya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists.  Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes.  Dharmakaya: dharmata eye existing in speech.
