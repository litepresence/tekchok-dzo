[7038] From Letter Non-Existent:
[7039] All arising: delusion appearance my mind;
[7040] All abiding: delusion appearance my heart;
[7041] All appearing: delusion appearance my body;
[7042] All sounding: delusion appearance my speech.

[7043] Seeing not-ceasing: appear like my form;
[7044] Hearing not-ceasing: sound like my sound;
[7045] Smelling not-ceasing: feel like my smell;
[7046] Tasting not-ceasing: tone like my taste;
[7047] Feeling not-ceasing: quick like my mind;
[7048] Secret afflictions: my miracles;
[7049] Buddhas beings: my cemetery;
[7050] All-making I: great self-clear appearance.

[7051] Thus it is said.

[7052] Then: if allowing delusion appearance to self-place release, will delusion not go again?
[7053] Although ordinary beings delude by grasping as self,
[7054] Yogis: by knowing basis-non-existent, not delude by placing self-settled without correcting-changing.

[7055] From Pearl Garland:
[7056] Those beings in samsara
[7057] Bind by self concepts' actions;
[7058] Certain liberate by knowing nature non-existent.

[7059] Thus it is said.

[7060] Also: delusion and liberation rely on inner knowing,
[7061] For outer appearance makes no delusion and liberation—
[7062] Enough to place appearance straight.

[7063] By Tilopa:
[7064] Appearance not bind; grasping binds—
[7065] Cut grasping, Naropa.

[7066] Thus the instruction.

[7067] That also: only placing self-know that actual meaning in self-tone nature,
[7068] Not correctable to good by purposefully corrected view-meditation-action, for nature unchangeable, and
[7069] For self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes not true.

[7070] From Perfection:
[7071] By thought not find primordial wisdom meaning;
[7072] By thought finding primordial wisdom meaning—
[7073] Self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7074] By meditation not see dharmakaya;
[7075] By meditation seeing dharmakaya—
[7076] Self-appearance dharmata becomes false.
[7077] By looking not realize awareness meaning;
[7078] By looking realizing awareness meaning—
[7079] Ceaseless dharmakaya becomes false.
[7080] By dharma not cut ignorance trace;
[7081] By dharma cutting ignorance trace—
[7082] Primordially pure primordial wisdom becomes false.

[7083] Thus it is said.

[7084] Thus: whatever conduct manner made, not transcend dharmata by realizing appear-know to dharmata.
