[8375] The metaphor for this is:
[8376] From the mirror of Vajrasattva's heart:
[8377] "A ho! Listen, Vajra holder!
[8378] Unripened conceptual samsara
[8379] Is like a corpse on a gibbet with irons inserted—
[8380] Without liberation, the time of liberation does not arise.
[8381] With the irons of ignorance inserted, one cannot become liberated.
[8382] Ignorance is like water—it gathers afflictions.
[8383] The fire of aversion is like a mass of fire at the end of an eon.
[8384] Attachment to entities is like drinking salt water.
[8385] Delusion's thickening is like darkness in an empty house.
[8386] Pride and arrogance are like overthrowing a mountain.
[8387] Jealousy and ill-will are like blindness in a narrow valley.
[8388] These five afflictions obscure wisdom.
[8389] The mind is like a thieving bitch.
[8390] Consciousness is like a forest monkey.
[8391] Mind is like impure mud and swamp.
[8392] The alaya is like a pig being.
[8393] Knowing is like a bird's feather carried by the wind.
[8394] Apprehending and grasping are like man and woman.
[8395] The distinction of karma is like a bird tangled in snares.
[8396] The distinction of suffering is like a whirlpool in water.
[8397] There is no method to endure the fruit of afflictions.
[8398] This fixated peg of apprehending and grasping, the suffering of samsara—
[8399] Through action one cannot exit; through release one becomes liberated.
[8400] Abandoning all done dharmas, easy accomplishment.
[8401] Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoving.
[8402] By the king of secret mantra, afflictions become wisdom.
[8403] Like raising a lamp in an empty house,
[8404] By the lamp of wisdom, ignorance becomes awareness.
[8405] Thus it is said.
[8406] Third, the summary of the way of separation from that has three parts:
[8407] The actual way of separation in one's own time through direct perception,
[8408] Establishing the proof of separation,
[8409] Speaking of other enumerations.
[8410] The first is:
[8411] By looking at the clear light of outer appearances,
[8412] Without delusion, when the meditation of inner self-tone is clear in its own place,
[8413] Mind and wisdom split instantly—the alaya with its eight collections is obscured by wisdom,
[8414] Samsara dharmas are not clear.
