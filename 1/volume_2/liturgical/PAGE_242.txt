[10428] Hear now the signs that mark the path of awakening—the common general signs known to all, and the supreme secret signs of the uncommon vehicle, made manifest through direct realization.
[10429] Of the first, there are three aspects:
[10430] Signs of confusion, where mind deceives itself through self-created delusion;
[10431] Signs of failing to reach the essential point of oral instruction, bringing uncertainty;
[10432] Signs of demonic obstacles, when direct awareness remains unseized.
[10433] The first category manifests even in those who have not entered practice—ordinary beings, birds, and wild creatures alike may display these transient transformations, yet they remain meaningless, mere signs of circumstance.
[10434] The second category arises during engagement with common vehicles, through preliminary training, or when conceptual minds undertake view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. To distinguish between deviation and correct path, I shall explain.
[10435] From among the one hundred and sixteen signs, fifty arise in body, speech, and mind with uncertain measure:
