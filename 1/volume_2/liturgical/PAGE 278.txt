Pleasure-pain, confused and not-confused, attachment-aversion, good and bad, possessing and not possessing dharmas—through many appearance-patterns, those who exercise in different cause-results by later good and bad karma.

In short, whatever appears to whoever, appears like the various good and bad dreams of yesterday. Appearing yet not established, they exercise in clear appearance of non-existence.

Second, particular explanation: from four. The appearance of the nature-remaining intermediate state: by the binding of the five aggregates of form, etc., the appearance of the five bodies self-ceases; by the binding of elements and sense-fields, the appearance of light and color self-ceases; by the binding of karma and afflictions, the appearance of wisdom and dharmata self-ceases. To outer appearing objects, inner grasping mind attaches, exercising day and night like a wheel in the depth of the difficult-to-cross water river of four errors, exercising in many karma and latent tendencies.

The four errors: not knowing the nature of samsara's confusion-appearance resembling dream and illusion, grasping impermanent as permanent, untrue as true, suffering cause-result as pleasure, and empty-by-nature as thing and mark.

As antidotes to these, the Conqueror proclaimed the four summaries of Dharma for guiding ordinary individual birth-beings.

The appearance of the death-time intermediate state: elements of body disturbed, outer body's suffering is felt; mental-factor feeling's path lost, inner mind's suffering is felt; latent-tendency grasping's lake overflows, the suffering of separating from this life's appearance though attached is felt; remembering self-harming non-dharma karma, the suffering of fearing to fall into later negative paths' precipice is felt; remembering the cherished body of attachment-grasping, who feels the suffering of fearing the support-aggregate's castle will collapse.
