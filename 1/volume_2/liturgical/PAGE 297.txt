Important meditation producing effort in not dying now. Sixth, showing birth-place signs: warmth dissolving to crown, certainly giving breath as excellent primordially-pure, middle intermediate state, last emanation-body. Ordinary birth-beings giving breath by birth in high realms. That also: at death-time, eye doing dust-eye, warmth gathering to genitals, birth toward animal. Hand moving right, warmth gathering to crown, god. Word confused, warmth gathering in right armpit, asura. Left foot moving, striking earth, warmth gathering to foot-sole, hell. Body yellow, luster not existing, warmth gathering to throat, hungry ghost. Word clear, memory not losing, warmth gathering in eye, birth in human birth-place.

Also from that self:

Outer appearance like this:
If warmth dissolves upward,
Become giving great breath;
If eye not clear, dust-eye,
Birth toward negative-path places.
If hands move right,
That person in god's place;
If word confused from mouth,
Birth like that in asura place;
Left foot striking earth,
That in hell's place;
Body's color yellow, luster not exist,
That in hungry-ghost land;
If uttering birth-being voice from mouth,
That in animal place;
Also or mouth mute, teeth closed,
Animal birth-place like that;
If word clear, memory not losing,
That in human's place.

Outer signs are those, join these inner signs: warmth gathering in crown, that in god's place; like that warmth gathering in foot-sole, that in hell's place; warmth gathering in right armpit, that in asura land; like that warmth gathering in throat, that person birth in hungry-ghost place; like that warmth gathering in genitals, that animal birth-place; warmth gathering in eye, birth in human's place. Thus whoever possesses signs, this is certain only—thus.

From those, especially warmth gathering to genitals at birth toward animal.
