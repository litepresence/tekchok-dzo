Awareness self-liberating without grasping,
Small grasping at outer-inner dharmas,
No attachment or clinging to body.

Fifth, awareness—five aspects:
Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.

Essence: appearing as vajra chain.
From Lion Power Complete:
Own-appearance awareness thing that,
Dwells as wisdom chain.

Definition: previously not-aware, aware by guru pith-instruction, therefore awareness.

Division: three—ground-dwell awareness beyond virtue-defect fault, path-appearance awareness famous in respective philosophical systems, insight awareness.

Mind-itself, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, mind-beyond, meaning alaya, bodhicitta called—whatever name, pervading all buddhas and beings, self-awareness wisdom self-clear empty naked this.

Insight awareness: direct appearance of vajra chain kaya, free from thought word cage, without bright-dim of virtue-defect fault-merit, if diligence not distracting from that view, accomplishes light-body transparent-penetrate.

Characteristic: this naked self-clear.

Result: liberates into primordially-pure transparent-penetrate by practicing that.

Though commonly considering three kayas as result, here making path, not establishing primordially-pure extreme-free great as kaya and wisdom, considers result like crystal not-ceasing arise-basis—great distinction.

Signs of training such awareness:

From Blazing Relics:

Who familiar with awareness,
These signs upon that body:
Able to insert self-awareness there,
Wherever thing is placed,
Body follows that
Wherever ground dwells,
As same as awareness,
Able to change others' faith,
Self-ceasing thought-continuum clinging,
Possessing inner signs—
Who knows directly,
This goes to elements' own-place,
This fortunate one dissolves,
Gains supreme unborn siddhi.
