[5316] The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:

[5317] Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[5318] The light-star-window of intermediate space appears.

[5319] Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[5320] Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.

[5321] The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[5322] The copper-shining stainless light-body.

[5323] The A mark in the center,
[5324] And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[5325] The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.

[5326] From the peaceful body's fingers,
[5327] Light-garlands coil in form.

[5328] Activity of silent mind,
[5329] From the skull palace of the head,
[5330] Herukas manifestly arise.

[5331] At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[5332] The copper-shining three bodies coil as one.

[5334] Third, the secret awareness measure:

[5335] Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[5336] There exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind,
[5337] Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.

[5338] From that itself:

[5339] At this time the mind is clear,
[5340] Together with the six clairvoyances,
[5341] Far and concealed
[5342] Dharmas become known in a moment.

[5343] Measureless Buddha-realms and
[5344] Likewise bodies appear to mind.

[5345] Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[5346] Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[5347] Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[5348] Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[5349] Without parts, without elaboration.

[5351] That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[5352] At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,
[5353] Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[5354] The body-mind connection cut,
[5355] Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.

[5356] The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness,
[5357] Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
