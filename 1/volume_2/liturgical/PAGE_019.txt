[979] Five families' mandalas, unmixed, clear in tone:
[980] From Self-Arisen:
[981] Individual colors unmixed, marks held,
[982] Marks and exemplary features excellent, light-rays blazing,
[983] Father, mother, kaya-form held—
[984] These are Sambhogakaya's characteristics.
[985] Thus it is spoken.
[986] Fourth, appearance manner:
[987] From rigpa's single nature,
[988] From expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates to directions performing benefit;
[989] Rigpa-kaya, unmoving from expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in self-appearance light-clarity field, the inner-outer appearance manner.
[990] From that same nature:
[991] In one nature, two essences—
[992] This is Sambhogakaya's appearance.
[993] Thus it is spoken.
[994] Fifth, abiding manner: expanse without acceptance or rejection,
[995] Space without duality,
[996] Five complete lights' vast expanse,
[997] Abiding in emanations-radiating great continuity.
[998] From Self-Arisen:
[999] Correctly produced, without reference,
[1000] Without entering or liberation mind,
[1001] How could grasping and engaging exist?
[1002] Beyond attachment and fixation words,
[1003] Beyond object-abandoning and abandoner-two,
[1004] Beyond field, mind, intellect.
[1005] In reference-free field,
[1006] Self-appearance cuts through words—appearance.
[1007] Grasping-free, liberated in its own place,
[1008] Emanations enacted in ten directions.
[1009] In reference-pure field appearance,
[1010] Wisdom arises in one cut.
[1011] In reference-free field appearance,
[1012] Marks liberate in their own place.
[1013] From that, emanations widely arise.
[1014] Thus it is spoken.
[1015] Third: extensively explained, Nirmanakaya ground—five aspects:
[1016] Essence,
[1017] Etymology,
[1018] Characteristic,
[1019] Division,
[1020] Examination method.
[1021] First, Nirmanakaya essence: from expanse-kaya and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya and so forth, performing others' benefit.
[1022] The etymology:
[1023] From Self-Arisen:
[1024] Know these emanation-kaya etymologies:
[1025] Because appearing suitable to world-realms beings—emanation kaya.
[1026] Because able to perform emanation-kaya benefit—emanation kaya.
[1027] Because performing all actions—emanation kaya.
[1028] Because able to liberate numberless beings into expanse—emanation kaya.
[1029] Because brief in time in one field realm—emanation kaya.
[1030] Because compassion arising without direction—emanation kaya.
[1031] Because wrathful and fierce—emanation kaya.
[1032] Because peaceful and certain—emanation kaya.
[1033] Because beings see as beautiful—emanation kaya.
[1034] Thus it is spoken.
[1035] Third, the characteristics:
