[5] Thus having shown the distinction of alaya-ground and dharmakaya, and so forth,
[6] Now, regarding the explanation of dependent arising's nature, there are two:
[7] The common distinction,
[8] And the extensive explanation of individual natures.
[9] First:
[10] Outer-arising and inner-arising—two types.
[11] From the Self-Arisen:
[12] The two types of arising are shown.
[13] Outer-arising and inner-arising.
[14] Thus it is said.
[15] Outer-arising—earth, water, and so forth—these exist as the basis for inner-arising; connected as basis and dependent, therefore established as twofold.
[16] Without depending upon these two, no beings nor buddhas exist.
[17] All beings move within the confused expanse of the five-arising,
[18] Possessing the self-nature of the great arising.
[19] All buddhas dwell in the expanse of the five pure-arisings: earth without solidity, and so forth,
[20] Moving in the complete cessation of the five great arising's stains.
[21] Furthermore, the five great arising possess luminosity-wisdom and five colors;
[22] The five small arisings are earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[23] The five pure arisings are:
[24] Clear,
[25] Warm,
[26] Bright,
[27] Cool,
[28] Spacious,
[29] Holding the self-nature of movement.
[30] From the five confused arisings, the five luminous arrive in the expanse, meeting the inner expanse,
[31] Like the purity of the great arising of spontaneous presence's appearance.
[32] Regarding the small arising, also arising-form,
[33] And actual arising—two.
[34] Arising-form is the five appearing now externally: earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[35] Actual arising is the five qualities of the body—thin, and so forth—becoming the five inner-arising bases.
[36] Inner-arising:
[37] The five individual dharma-arisings, bases of pure realms.
[38] Therefore all samsara and nirvana do not move from the expanse of the five-arising;
[39] Before the five-arising, samsara and nirvana do not arise.
[40] From the Self-Arisen:
[41] Kye Ho! Secret Lord, listen!
[42] The characteristics of the five-arising:
[43] I show—you must understand.
[44] The great arising, Bhagavan,
[45] Exist as the nature of all beings.
[46] All beings of the three realms
[47] Move in the expanse of the five-arising.
[48] Before the time when the five-arising did not exist,
[49] Neither buddhas nor beings—even names did not exist.
[50] The five-arising themselves are the mother-expanse.
[51] Not established from the five-arising,
[52] Not even one birth-going being exists.
[53] The five-arisings of beings dwelling therein
[54] Are shown as twofold.
[55] Thus it is said.
[56] Second: regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are two:
