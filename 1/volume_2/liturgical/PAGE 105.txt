Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
From Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
Thus body, etcetera—
By fully pressing all main-points,
Awareness itself and directly,
From guru's instruction, know.

Thus said, and:
From Thalgyur:
Relying upon actual main, self mind,
Body main-point and speech and also,
Relying upon mind main-point,
Making wind somehow slow,
Arising from fully projecting,
Body and mind connection cut that,
Not reversing even in three realms.

Thus said, and:
Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
Field: separate from obscuration-doer;
Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.

Thus it was said.

Second: from three main-points—gate,
Field,
And wind-awareness.

First: wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner;
Train in three bodies' gaze manners.

From Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
By dharmakaya gaze manner,
Press and extract three-realms' samsara;
Sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground;
Nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field.

Thus said, and:
From Letterless:
Gaze eye at sky element.

Thus said, and:
From Secret Sound Tantra:
Lower, reverse, corner—three;
Gaze manner types three, famous.

Thus it was said.

That also: nirmanakaya, lower, buddha, looking at disciples;
Sambhogakaya, corner look, buddha, looking at field-realm;
Dharmakaya, reverse, buddha, looking at base.

Yogin with bad eye faculty:
Harmonizing with nirmanakaya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists.
Eye possessing fault:
Harmonizing with sambhogakaya, eye clear purpose exists.
Eye faculty good:
Harmonizing with dharmakaya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists.

Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes.
Dharmakaya: dharmata eye existing in speech.
