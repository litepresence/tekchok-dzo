[584] Altering and transforming—
[585] Unable to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[586] Like earth and sky,
[587] Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[588] The heart essence of the expanse, the dharmakaya,
[589] Abiding as awareness itself, holding the basis of all.
[590] The palace where it abides is
[591] From that very source:
[592] The dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—
[593] Thus it is said.
[594] When that dharmakaya abides within the precious interior,
[595] It is called the pure original tone of dharmata,
[596] The house possessing the light of awareness,
[597] Abiding in the display of light.
[598] This is called the primordial common basis, the expanse of awareness,
[599] The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[600] Second, the extensive explanation of the five fires, from Self-Arising:
[601] There are five fires:
[602] The fire pervading all outer and inner,
[603] The fire illuminating all outer and inner,
[604] The fire equalizing all outer and inner,
[605] The fire conceptualizing the actions of outer and inner,
[606] The fire accomplishing the actions of outer and inner—thus five.
[607] These also, in sequence,
[608] Reside in the lungs,
[609] The eyes and the five limbs, making six,
[610] The flesh gaps,
[611] The two soles of the feet,
[612] And the two palms of the hands, producing warmth.
[613] Third, the five earths as well:
[614] From that same source:
[615] There are five earths:
[616] The all-illuminating earth,
[617] The unchanging vajra earth,
[618] The precious earth from which all arise,
[619] The all-pervading earth showing appearances,
[620] The earth of perfected accomplishment—thus five.
[621] These also, in sequence,
[622] Together with awareness,
[623] Together with the lamp,
[624] Together with the thigle,
[625] Together with wisdom,
[626] Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[627] Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arising:
[628] The five kinds of waters are:
[629] The unchanging water,
[630] The peaceful, clear, and pure water,
[631] The water of extensively arising qualities,
[632] The water without attachment,
[633] The water of completion without grasping—thus five.
[634] These also, according to sequence,
[635] Together with all the channels—
