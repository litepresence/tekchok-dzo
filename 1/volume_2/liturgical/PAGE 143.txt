[6027] Freely buddha-ed, beyond reference and thought;
[6028] Cutting the path to nameless buddhahood everywhere, in all directions.

[6029] Nothing to look at, nothing looked at;
[6030] No viewer;
[6031] Not seen by looking.

[6032] Nothing to meditate;
[6033] Nothing meditated;
[6034] Beyond meditation;
[6035] Not freed by meditating.

[6036] Nothing to analyze;
[6037] Nothing analyzing;
[6038] No need to analyze;
[6039] Analyzing is useless effort.

[6040] No need to accomplish;
[6041] Already accomplished;
[6042] Nothing to accomplish;
[6043] Not accomplished by accomplishing;
[6044] No need for accomplishment.

[6045] Nothing to do;
[6046] No doer;
[6047] Already done;
[6048] Beyond doing;
[6049] Doing also limited;
[6050] No need to do;
[6051] Nothing to do to dharma;
[6052] Doing is not dharma;
[6053] Not-doing: nothing to accomplish.

[6054] Not abandoning samsara;
[6055] Not taking nirvana;
[6056] Accomplishment: direction placed.

[6057] Primordially equal, leveled-vast, original, nameless.

[6058] Whatever vision, abiding as primordially buddha-ed without basis from the ground—bind-free effort self-ceases.
[6059] Whatever dawn, everywhere limitlessly level-placed, primordially pure, self-empty, vastly.
[6060] Whatever buddha-ed, interior vastness of self-mind without doing, effort ceasing everywhere without equal level, abiding as primordially empty and self-pure without trace.

[6061] Applying scripture to the meaning realized by oneself—all dharmas primordially self-dawning in the abide-manner of great perfection nature.

[6062] From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:

[6063] The nature of great perfection:
[6064] All meanings enter the center of mind;
[6065] Non-vision, objectless, without conceptuality,
[6066] Uncut, naturally cutting at self-ground.

[6067] Non-awareness of not experiencing delusion severed,
[6068] Unexamined, primordially cutting, abiding.

[6069] Above, who has not felt all this?
[6070] All these coarse elements also,
[6071] Naturally ceasing from the first,
[6072] Without place to go, naturally going,
[6073] Self-body primordially non-existent,
[6074] Known here without before or after.

[6075] All this, timeless, vastly timed,
[6076] By one, two, and six-three:
[6077] Non-vision, vision, and half-vision,
[6078] In self-sound of non-vision doing,
[6079] Exceeding ground-holding ground.

[6080] Who has not felt primordial abiding?
[6081] Path without primordial traverse,
[6082] This path primordially near,
[6083] This also primordially abiding from self,
[6084] Not seen before—dull self-knowing.

[6085] Intention of non-abiding samadhi:
[6086] Primordially abiding without meditation.
[6087] This also: who did not know before?
