[9654] [9654] Wisdom must exist in space,
[9655] [9655] That mixing of five lights and white is mirror wisdom.
[9656] [9656] Example of white arising separately, emanation-body emanating from enjoyment-body.
[9657] [9657] Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.
[9658] [9658] Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvana":
[9659] [9659] Emanation-body and enjoyment-body dissolving into Dharma-body,
[9660] [9660] By being free from crystal sun's condition,
[9661] [9661] Abiding undeluded having seized stable ground at beginning's primordially pure base,
[9662] [9662] Though liberated like that, essence not separate,
[9663] [9663] By distinction of aware and not-aware,
[9664] [9664] Called all-knowing: all abiding only in wisdom-body.
[9665] [9665] Mainly possessing two wisdoms.
[9666] [9666] Existing as interior-clear, that essence delivering to cease ground and first human's common-base self-arise essence-itself body are not separate.
[9667] [9667] However, like sun obscured by cloud,
[9668] [9668] From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,
[9669] [9669] Beginning base and
[9670] [9670] End liberation ground two—very great distinction.
[9671] [9671] Great essential point.
[9672] [9672] Wisdom swirling in space like crystal light.
[9673] [9673] Dharma-body arising clear-pure like crystal itself.
[9674] [9674] Thus it is spoken.
[9675] [9675] That Dharma-body of knowing self-essence, self itself abiding in self-bed,
[9676] [9676] If desiring to hold stable ground of undeluded Dharma-body now also,
[9677] [9677] Great essential point is keeping undistracted, clear, snap in manner of great open naked self-clear,
[9678] [9678] From glorious holy guru protector of beings' mouth:
[9679] [9679] Dharma-body of knowing self-essence is self-bed itself,
[9680] [9680] All who desire to hold stable undeluded ground,
[9681] [9681] Essential point is doing not-wrong, not-deluded, not-distracted,
[9682] [9682] Let wisdom-possessing know intention like ocean.
[9683] [9683] Thus well spoken.
[9684] [9684] At time of all this introduction, relaxing freshly, self also producing uncommon new confidence, should demonstrate to others.
