[497] [497] Nondual with life,
[498] [498] Nondual with awareness,
[499] [499] Nondual with lamp,
[500] [500] Nondual with bindhu,
[501] [501] Abide nondual with wisdom.
[502] [502] Third, the five color-radiance producing winds—also from That Source:
[503] [503] In color-radiance producing wind also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[504] [504] Mind-arising wind and
[505] [505] Radiance-possessing wind and
[506] [506] Burning wind and
[507] [507] Wildness wind—five. Thus.
[508] [508] Those also according to sequence: wisdom-object,
[509] [509] Appearing-object,
[510] [510] Lamp-object,
[511] [511] Non-awareness object,
[512] [512] Mind-object horse making.
[513] [513] Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
[514] [514] From the Self-Arisen:
[515] [515] In all-pervading wind also five:
[516] [516] Base-pervading and
[517] [517] Immediate-pervading and
[518] [518] Hatred-fear pervading and
[519] [519] Memory-pervading and
[520] [520] All body-pervading by holding—five. Thus.
[521] [521] Those also according to sequence:
[522] [522] Wisdom-appearing,
[523] [523] Lamp-appearing,
[524] [524] Knowing-appearing,
[525] [525] Thinking-appearing,
[526] [526] Mind-appearing potency making.
[527] [527] Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
[528] [528] Again from That Source:
[529] [529] In compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[530] [530] Movement-making wind and
[531] [531] Liberation-making wind and
[532] [532] Reversal-making wind and
[533] [533] Swiftness-making wind and
[534] [534] Moments wind—five. Thus.
[535] [535] Those also according to sequence:
[536] [536] Aggregates-pervading,
[537] [537] Moments-pervading,
[538] [538] Bardo-pervading,
[539] [539] Concepts-pervading,
[540] [540] Three-pervading—moments, actions, completion.
[541] [541] Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[542] [542] These terms' explanation:
[543] [543] From the Self-Arisen:
[544] [544] Because of true-ground movement-making,
[545] [545] Move-making wind it is called.
[546] [546] Because of pure wisdom's life-holding,
[547] [547] Life-holding wind it is called.
[548] [548] Because of five wisdom-lights' self-nature existing,
[549] [549] Color-radiance producing wind it is called.
[550] [550] Because of wisdom's true expanse liberation ability,
[551] [551] Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.  [552] Because of wisdom-appearing's non-gathering non-separating abiding,  [553] Fire-equal wind it is called. Thus.  [554] Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness-wisdom, now abiding in heart,  [555] That is wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights' essential point.  [556] When awareness separates from wind, wisdom-expanse gathering,  [557] Outer-inner's non-manifest also arrives at pure wind-mind's essential point.
