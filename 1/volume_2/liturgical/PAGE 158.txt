[6676] Thus to dwelling dharmata:
[6677] Delusion not-existing from the beginning,
[6678] In dharmakaya like sky,
[6679] Obscured by sudden beings' clouds.

[6680] Also non-deluded dwelling dharmata
[6681] Appears in mind as deluded manner.

[6683] Beings' five afflictions themselves:
[6684] In meaning, they do not exist—
[6685] Like clouds in sky,
[6686] Sudden, with conditions,
[6687] Clouds arise from sky itself.
[6688] Knowing thus dissolve into sky,
[6689] Called "non-different one nature."

[6690] Thus afflictions' stains themselves,
[6691] Knowing self-arising, self-ceasing,
[6692] How could beings be bound?

[6694] Appearance-manner unestablished like
[6695] Appearing as grasping, yet nowhere established—
[6696] Shown also as great placelessness.

[6697] From Heap of Jewels:
[6698] "This mind itself without dwelling place,
[6699] Without going place, wondrous!
[6700] To six minds entering all,
[6701] Without depending place, wondrous!
[6702] To all-gathering all-ground,
[6703] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6704] To circling-deluding ignorance,
[6705] Without changing power, wondrous!
[6706] To all object-attaching afflictions,
[6707] Without basis-root, wondrous!
[6708] To subtle and coarse stains,
[6709] Without grasping place, wondrous!
[6710] To coarse elemental forms,
[6711] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6712] To person's depending life-breath,
[6713] Without time-setting, wondrous!
[6714] To six aggregates' object appearances,
[6715] Without permanence, wondrous!
[6716] To person's arisen memory-thought feelings,
[6717] Without exhaustion, wondrous!"

[6720] "This basisless dharmata—
[6721] Great wonder, placed without searching!
[6722] To going-coming awareness—
[6723] Great wonder, without end!
[6724] To primordially dwelling great wisdom—
[6725] Great wonder, without antidote!"

[6727] Also from Arya Samadhi Raja, common vehicle:
[6728] "How in mid-space, little cloudless,
[6729] Momentarily cloud mandala appears,
[6730] Arising-ceasing, that cloud mandala—
[6731] Examine from what first it arose!
[6732] Know all dharmas thus.

[6733] How person dwells in rock mountain hollow,
[6734] From singing, speaking, laughing, crying,
[6735] Echoes arise depending on conditions,
[6736] Yet that tone from sound never moves.
[6737] Know all dharmas thus."
[6738] Extensively said.

[6739] Second meaning: face-introducing foundation primordial wisdom without move-change, copper-shining dharma-exhaust mind-transcend intention—three:
