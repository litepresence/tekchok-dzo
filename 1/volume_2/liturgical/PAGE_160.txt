[6793] From Perfection:
[6794] This dharma-nature, entity-separate, grasping-attachment non-existent—
[6795] Buddhas' intention dharma of non-duality;
[6796] Particular emptiness and signs' word path,
[6797] Dharma-nature of action-effort non-existent, pure in self-place;
[6798] Complete samadhi, entering from dharma-nature object.

[6799] Pure and impure: term dharmas non-existent;
[6800] Meaning primordially dwelling, transcending one and two;
[6801] Self-body in nature, entering single bindu;
[6802] Time non-existent realization: samadhi not-wandering clear;
[6803] Extreme and center non-existent: dharma-nature name-separate;
[6804] Change not: straight, pervading all;
[6805] Made not: spontaneously accomplished in arising place.

[6806] Thus it is said.

[6807] Second: maintaining that nature has three:
[6808] Maintaining view-meditation object-transcending great,
[6809] Maintaining samadhi self-settled great,
[6810] Maintaining intention mind-transcending great.

[6811] First:
[6812] In that face-introduction nature, without mind-grasping effort and purpose-meditation antidote entering—place awareness vast wide, primordially placed, height-top vast, interval non-existent, self-liberated.

[6813] From Jewel Display:
[6814] Vast: dharma-nature completely pure;
[6815] Great: view wonderful great;
[6816] Appearance face: mandala self-appearance itself;
[6817] Object and object-non-existent: completely pure;
[6818] Outer and inner non-existent: completely appear;
[6819] Empty and not-empty: transcending words.

[6820] Thus said, and:
[6821] From Lion Perfection:
[6822] To whatever place the first place is,
[6823] The last goes to that place;
[6824] Now: dwell in that meaning.

[6825] Thus said, and:
[6826] Also:
[6827] In sky of grasping-thought non-existent,
[6828] In sky of consciousness non-existent—
[6829] Consciousness mind unmoved:
[6830] Supreme samadhi of non-wandering,
[6831] Single Buddha grove manner.

[6832] Thus it is said.

[6833] Second has three:
[6834] Self-dwelling just-place:
[6835] Without making grasping-elaboration on aggregate-object appearance, outer-inner-middle non-existent, wide, self-liberated, vast place—
[6836] Even when going to sleep, sleeping in that nature, dreams dawn in clear light.

[6837] Great thunder is:
