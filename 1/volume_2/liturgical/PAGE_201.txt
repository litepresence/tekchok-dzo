[8586] Through this, sound too attains autonomy.
[8587] Summarily, the six clairvoyances as well
[8588] This fortunate one obtains,
[8589] And benefits both self and others—
[8590] This person shall accomplish.
[8591] Thus it is spoken.

[8592] Second, the measure of spontaneously accomplished samadhi:
[8593] From that very source:
[8594] The intention of the three self-arisen bodies
[8595] Is summarily found as experience-measures thus.
[8596] The yoga conduct of emanation-body—
[8597] Formerly nonexistent great compassion
[8598] Arises supreme within one's continuum.
[8599] At this time, emanation-body samadhi is obtained.
[8600] The experience of clear yet non-conceptual cognition
[8601] Is called enjoyment-body samadhi.
[8602] The uncontaminated emptiness bindu-body,
[8603] When self-arising without effort—
[8604] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8605] This endowed yogin obtains.
[8606] Thus it is spoken.

[8592] Second, the measure of spontaneously perfect samadhi:
[8593] Again from that same source:
[8594] The self-arisen intention of the three bodies
[8595] Is found in summary as measures of experience thus.
[8596] Practicing the yoga of emanation-body,
[8597] Great compassion previously nonexistent
[8598] Arises supreme within one's own continuum.
[8599] At this time, the samadhi of emanation-body is obtained.
[8600] The experience of clear non-conceptual knowing
[8601] Is called the samadhi of enjoyment-body.
[8602] The bindu-body of uncontaminated emptiness,
[8603] When self-arising without effort—
[8604] The samadhi of Dharma-body
[8605] This yogin endowed obtains.
[8606] Thus it is spoken.

[8607] Third, the time of immovable equipoise has two aspects:
[8608] The time when luminosity appears manifestly,
[8609] And the time when instructions strike the arising-place.
[8610] First:
[8611] From that same source:
[8612] When all appearances become self-powered,
[8613] When awareness is demonstrated manifestly,
[8614] This is called the time of true-seeing intention.
[8615] When all appearances arise in self-direction,
[8616] When experience-seed increases,
[8617] This is called the time when awareness reaches balance.
[8618] When the power of arising persons ceases,
[8619] When cognition looks inward,
[8620] This is the time of striking awareness's arising-place.
[8621] When Dharma-nature, free from conditions, causes all appearances to spread wide in bliss,
[8622] This is called the time of mother-son Dharma-nature equality.
[8623] When the true light-rays of all Buddhas fill and expand one's body,
[8624] When body manifests enlightenment,
[8625] This is called the time of obtaining self-stability.
[8626] Thus it is spoken.

[8627] Second, the time of striking the instruction arising-place:
[8628] From Self-Arising:
[8629] When cognition-awareness arises in the continuum,
[8630] Recognize the face of body.
[8631] When realization arises in the continuum, recognize the face of awareness's field.
