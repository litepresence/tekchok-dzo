[2631] Gods' and humans' mind-holding:

[2632] Having held mouth-nose breath, and—

[2633] Thought-free, unmoved mind—

[2634] Is the nature of one-pointed awareness.

[2635] Spoken to be without instantaneous thought.

[2636] Cannot indicate the great true meaning.

[2637] Thus it is.

[2638] Second: the bodhisattva's meditation—two:

[2639] Actual divisions, and—

[2640] Arisen as auxiliary.

[2641] First, from two:

[2642] Briefly taught.

[2643] From Rangshar:

[2644] The bodhisattva's meditation—

[2645] Is holding by mind, and—

[2646] Arises by manner or force.

[2647] Familiarized, becomes expanse, and—

[2648] Abandoning food-concept.

[2649] Practiced by ground-dwellers.

[2650] Thought by manner is without.

[2651] That also cannot indicate great meaning.

[2652] Thus it is.

[2653] That also—nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light, and—

[2655] Extensively explained—three from:

[2656] Nature-force meditation is—

[2659] Focused-support meditation is—

[2660] Meditate antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, and—

[2661] Only suppress afflictions' heads.

[2662] Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration—only purifying self-ground latencies.

[2663] That from Sun-Moon Union:

[2664] The Great Vehicle's meditation—

[2665] By nature-force meditation—

[2666] Unfabricated body-speech relaxed-down.

[2667] By focused-support meditation—

[2668] Suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads.

[2669] By ground-dwellers' meditation—

[2670] Sustains self-self continuum.

[2671] Thus it is.

[2672] Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two:

[2673] Nature, and—

[2674] Fabricated meditation.
