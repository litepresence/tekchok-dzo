[2631] [2631] Gods' and humans' mind-holding:
[2632] [2632] Having held mouth-nose breath, and—
[2633] [2633] Thought-free, unmoved mind—
[2634] [2634] Is the nature of one-pointed awareness.
[2635] [2635] Spoken to be without instantaneous thought.
[2636] [2636] Cannot indicate the great true meaning.
[2637] [2637] Thus it is.
[2638] [2638] Second: the bodhisattva's meditation—two:
[2639] [2639] Actual divisions, and—
[2640] [2640] Arisen as auxiliary.
[2641] [2641] First, from two:
[2642] [2642] Briefly taught.
[2643] [2643] From Rangshar:
[2644] [2644] The bodhisattva's meditation—
[2645] [2645] Is holding by mind, and—
[2646] [2646] Arises by manner or force.
[2647] [2647] Familiarized, becomes expanse, and—
[2648] [2648] Abandoning food-concept.
[2649] [2649] Practiced by ground-dwellers.
[2650] [2650] Thought by manner is without.
[2651] [2651] That also cannot indicate great meaning.
[2652] [2652] Thus it is.
[2653] [2653] That also—nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light, and—
[2654] [2654] Not merely thought-free dwelling—therefore cannot indicate great meaning.
[2655] [2655] Extensively explained—three from:
[2656] [2656] Nature-force meditation is—
[2657] [2657] Arises spontaneously-accomplished, non-thought manner, and—
[2658] [2658] Only placing body-speech relaxed-down.
[2659] [2659] Focused-support meditation is—
[2660] [2660] Meditate antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, and—
[2661] [2661] Only suppress afflictions' heads.
[2662] [2662] Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration—only purifying self-ground latencies.
[2663] [2663] That from Sun-Moon Union:
[2664] [2664] The Great Vehicle's meditation—
[2665] [2665] By nature-force meditation—
[2666] [2666] Unfabricated body-speech relaxed-down.
[2667] [2667] By focused-support meditation—
[2668] [2668] Suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads.
[2669] [2669] By ground-dwellers' meditation—
[2670] [2670] Sustains self-self continuum.
[2671] [2671] Thus it is.
[2672] [2672] Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two:
[2673] [2673] Nature, and—
[2674] [2674] Fabricated meditation.
[2675] [2675] First, nature meditation is—
[2676] [2676] Sentient beings all—when awareness distracted—arises from slightly trembling abiding, and.
