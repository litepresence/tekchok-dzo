In viewing, the essential point is to gaze unmoving at the midst of the sky's expanse, like unto a waterfall's cascade. And thus, from the letterless state:

*/ Rig-pa resting in equipoise—this upadesa itself,
*/ This the secret thig-le of enlightened intent.
*/ The eyes held steadfast in absorption,
*/ And thus examined apart from gathering and dispersal.
*/ From the very corner of the eyes the expanse emerges,
*/ Light subtle and swirling arises.
*/ Its nature: lu-gu-rgyud itself,
*/ Subtle, flickering, and mobile.
*/ The eyes examined as the element of space,
*/ The thig-le of the Buddha-body dawns.
*/ Attaining the warmth of that very dgongs-pa,
*/ Rig-pa's body—lu-gu-rgyud itself—
*/ Together with the body, appearance dawns.

Thus.

Furthermore, at this juncture, establishing the three points of luminosity: the manner of mind's obscurations being purified in the dgongs-pa of essence; the manner of resting evenly unmoving in the state; and from that, the manner of signs, measures, and definitive time dawning. Of these three, the first has three aspects: the dgongs-pa of essence itself; the metaphor demonstrating mind and habitual patterns; and the essential summary of the manner of separation from these.

Of the first, from the Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind:

*/ In the unmoving sky, rig-pa clear like unto it,
*/ Clear yet unwavering—depth unfathomable.
*/ Empty-luminosity, vast and open, in the great bliss expanse I wander,
*/ Single-pointed clarity in the state of dharmata expanse.
*/ Unmixed and perfected, established in spontaneous presence.

Thus.

The nature of rig-pa, wherein the four wisdoms self-manifest as one's own rtsal, demonstrates the natural state of superior seeing. The four wisdoms, from Rang shar:

Furthermore, regarding the nature of rig-pa:

*/ The fourfold wisdom it possesses,
*/ These four wisdoms are thus:

*/ The liberating wisdom—
*/ Liberates all completely.
*/ Liberates into the pure field of kleshas,
*/ Liberates into the state free from concept and birth,
*/ Liberates into the expanse of rig-pa from non-recognition,
*/ Liberates conceptual wisdom into the state.
*/ Therefore, the liberating wisdom.

*/ The activating wisdom—
*/ Activates the five bodies into pure expanse,
*/ Activates the five lights into non-grasping expanse,
*/ Activates rig-pa ye-shes into expanse,
*/ Activates the lamp into space-expanse.
*/ Therefore, the activating wisdom.

*/ The gathering wisdom—
*/ Gathers elements into the five lights,
*/ Gathers space into the lamp,
*/ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
*/ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
*/ Therefore, the gathering wisdom—
*/ Gathers elements into the five lights,
*/ Gathers space into the lamp,
*/ Gathers the five bodies into rig-pa's state,
*/ Gathers rig-pa into the non-conceptual.
*/ Therefore, the gathering wisdom.

*/ The discriminating wisdom—
*/ Discriminates non-recognition and rig-pa as two,
*/ Discriminates kleshas and ye-shes as two,
*/ Discriminates pure and impure as two,
*/ Discriminates samsara and nirvana as two,
*/ Discriminates realization and non-realization as two,
*/ Discriminates good and bad as two.
*/ Therefore, the discriminating wisdom.

Thus.

Furthermore, the second: through the purification at that very time of mind and habitual patterns—the objects to be purified by dgongs-pa...
