[1036] Performing the completion of the two benefits for disciples:
[1037] From that itself:
[1038] The characteristics of emanation-kaya:
[1039] Performing the completion of actions,
[1040] Considered in two aspects.

[1041] Thus it is spoken.

[1042] Fourth, divisions: generally explained as nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, and so forth;
[1043] On this occasion, depending upon the establishment of the completion of the two benefits,
[1044] The emanation-kaya of completed actions
[1045] And the emanation-kaya of performing actions—these two are held.

[1046] Moreover, the emanation-kaya of completed actions, self-benefit spontaneously established:
[1047] In this life or the intermediate state, completing the gate of spontaneously accomplished self-appearance,
[1048] Through the emanation of the three connections, benefit is performed for those arising as self-appearance of the six realms from the gate of impurity,
[1049] Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying the six families, the expanse is peaceful.

[1050] The self-appearance of samsara must be emptied,
[1051] For delusion-appearance must be emptied.
[1052] In common as well:
[1053] "May the three lower realms of samsara be exhausted and emptied,"
[1054] Thus it is said, and
[1055] For the sake of producing the mind to liberate all beings.

[1056] Particularly in the intermediate state: able or unable to release emanations, opening emanations and thus becoming Buddha—all actions,
[1057] When the stations of the six realms appear below in the gate of spontaneously accomplished self-appearance,
[1058] There, through teaching Dharma and so forth, benefit is performed for that self-appearance of emptiness appearing as self-appearance,
[1059] By that cause, all that appears as samsara becomes empty,
[1060] When dissolving into the expanse of pure nirvana through the gate of spontaneous accomplishment,
[1061] It is called "Buddha entering nirvana."

[1062] This is of crucial importance to all who possess wisdom.

[1063] Furthermore, that appearance in emptiness for establishing self-benefit, being an emanation arisen from oneself that liberates oneself into the expanse, is called the emanation-kaya of completed actions.

[1064] From self-arisen:
[1065] The emanation-kaya of completed actions:
[1066] Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened,
[1067] From that, distributing emanations.
[1068] Outer and inner actions complete—
[1069] Considered as the emanation-kaya of completed actions.

[1070] Thus it is spoken.

[1071] The manner of distributing emanations:
