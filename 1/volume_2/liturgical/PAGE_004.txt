[173] [173] Connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction.
[174] [174] Wind-characteristic, making lifting,
[175] [175] Connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction.
[176] [176] Fire-characteristic, making burning,
[177] [177] Connects with awareness-wisdom gone under afflictions' authority.
[178] [178] Water-characteristic, making moistening,
[179] [179] Connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects.
[180] [180] Space-characteristic, vastness,
[181] [181] Connects with awareness-characteristic without break in continuity—thus it is said.
[182] [182] Eighth, the manner of the five-arising's liberation:
[183] [183] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[184] [184] Space itself, by pervading emptiness,
[185] [185] Space itself liberates as entity.
[186] [186] Wind, by appearing without graspable object,
[187] [187] Liberates into entity-gathering's function.
[188] [188] Fire, by consuming what ripens,
[189] [189] Liberates by moving and separating clear from impure.
[190] [190] Earth, when making the producer lift,
[191] [191] Liberates into limitless empty non-entity.
[192] [192] Water, by moistening what gathers,
[193] [193] Liberates into burning-ripening's function.
[194] [194] Thus.
[195] [195] Explaining divisions:
[196] [196] Each of the five-arising—earth of earth, and so forth—five sets of five;
[197] [197] Enumeration of portions: twenty-five.
[198] [198] Again from That Very:
[199] [199] Space's wind toward entity,
[200] [200] Space's fire makes gathering,
[201] [201] Space's water makes burning,
[202] [202] Space's earth opens opportunity,
[203] [203] Space's space appears.
[204] [204] Wind's wind toward stability,
[205] [205] Wind's space: great sound-potential,
[206] [206] Wind's water: great quickness and speed,
[207] [207] Wind's fire: great projection and gathering,
[208] [208] Wind's earth: clear form-reflection.
[209] [209] Water's water: sound-echo,
[210] [210] Water's space: without obstruction,
[211] [211] Water's wind: flows attachment-free,
[212] [212] Water's fire: makes gathering,
[213] [213] Water's earth: makes pervading.
[214] [214] Fire's earth: makes producing,
[215] [215] Fire's space: burns entity,
[216] [216] Fire's wind: makes blazing,
[217] [217] Fire's water: makes destroying,
[218] [218] Fire's earth: holds.
[219] [219] Earth's earth: pervades migrators,
[220] [220] Earth's space: the mahayana,
[221] [221] Earth's wind: makes snow-empty,
[222] [222] Earth's water: produces entity,
[223] [223] Earth's fire: dries.
[224] [224] Thus.
[225] [225] By training in these distinctions, distinguished qualities; each accomplished. In that commentary it is explained—
