Pulling human body as jewel, by that sending toward liberation-fortune-possessive-one. Doing like that for three or five or seven days, burning or sending aggregates—god human special or liberation signs not arising in sky is not possible.

Those also from Sun-Moon Union:

At time of that self becoming to die,
In outflow-with aggregate,
Putting vase on crown,
Letter's syllable self and
By wisdom water stream purifying,
From empty hell places,
After that, like that.

To one possessing hungry-ghost sign,
By preparation of letter BHAYA,
Together with breath, number seven,
Putting BHAYA on tongue's top,
Consciousness gathering by that essence,
Like that on vase mouth's top,
By wisdom water stream washing,
From empty hungry-ghost places,
That person also after that.

Whoever possesses animal sign,
By preparation of letter RGYA,
Do purify this's places;
Together with breath, time number nine,
Hitting genitals by RGYA,
Consciousness by emptiness,
Again throwing with wind together;
Like that on vase genitals' top,
By wisdom water stream washing,
From empty animal places,
That person also after that.

Whoever arises god's sign,
By preparation of letter TAM,
Also together with breath, number,
Purifying consciousness with eleven;
Thus think letter TAM in crown,
Pull outflow-not consciousness to eye;
Like that on vase crown's top,
By wisdom water stream purifying,
From empty god places,
By that obtain human birth-place.

Whoever possesses asura sign,
By preparation of letter KEM,
Together with breath, twenty's number,
Also armpit self in right,
Wise one putting letter KEM.
