[265] [265] Projecting wind's moving portion—
[266] [266] Self-aware awakening, great bliss.
[267] [267] Five-arising cause's seed
[268] [268] Arises, appearing from emptiness-field.
[269] [269] Two's bliss equipoise
[270] [270] Is wisdom itself arisen from method.
[271] [271] Womb-belly entering
[272] [272] Is self-awareness arising from base.
[273] [273] Seven seven-sets' realization measure.
[274] [274] Ten months' grounds traversing.
[275] [275] Birth itself is kaya-arising.
[276] [276] Producing body is base-appearing field.
[277] [277] Body-abiding is the base.
[278] [278] Aging is delusion's confusion-awakening.
[279] [279] Sickness itself is realization-confidence.
[280] [280] By death, liberation into dharmata-emptiness.
[281] [281] Thus all appearing beings
[282] [282] Are primordially liberated without effort.
[283] [283] Thus.
[284] [284] Connecting with delusion-reversing particular manner:
[285] [285] Birth is awareness moving from expanse's portion.
[286] [286] Body is the base.
[287] [287] Outer-appearing portion is base-appearing spontaneous completion.
[288] [288] Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face.
[289] [289] Aging is truth-clinging's confusion-awakening.
[290] [290] Death, when knowing self-face, shows final arrival at primordial purity's ground in inner expanse's portion.
[291] [291] By these arising primordially, instruction introduction and
[292] [292] Empowerment,
[293] [293] Liberation through meditation—suitable.
[294] [294] If complete in partial similarity, not able to liberate through instruction;
[295] [295] By clearly showing that partial similarity exists, buddha's dharma it is called.
[296] [296] Existing in base-path's primordial measure,
[297] [297] What becomes shown as symbol-meaning by buddha's speaking also arrives at this essence.
[298] [298] Second, explaining body-mind completeness manner in particular—threefold:
[299] [299] Body,
[300] [300] Mind,
[301] [301] Awareness completeness manner.
[302] [302] First:
[303] [303] In this four-arising gathered aggregate, outer container-world's portion and
[304] [304] Inner essence-migrants' portions—all complete.
[305] [305] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[306] [306] Earth, water, fire, wind,
[307] [307] Space, sun, and moon,
[308] [308] Born males and females' forms,
[309] [309] Planets, stars, and clouds,
[310] [310] Trees, mountains, and rocks,
[311] [311] Roots, trunks, and branches,
[312] [312] Leaves, flowers, and fruits,
[313] [313] Smells, tastes, sounds, and touches.
