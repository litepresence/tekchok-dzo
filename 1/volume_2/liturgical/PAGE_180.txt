Settled-only by liberation,
Knowing-only by essence-peak liberated,
Ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol,
Completely-liberated and so forth—
Though many, this great rang-grol
Antidote not-existing, effort not-needed is shown.

Third: extensive explanation of rang-grol's dgongs-pa, having three:
Essence briefly shown, nature individually explained, meaning's conclusion.

First: From Pearl Garland:

To rig-pa without cessation,
*/ Delusion-cause not-existing, returning-place not.
*/ Ye-grol is definitely transcended,
*/ Rang-grol is objects-conditions exhausted,
*/ Cer-grol is appearances purified,
*/ Extreme-liberation is four-extremes ceased,
*/ Single-liberation is many emptied.

Thus: outer-inner non-dual zang-thal's rig-pa, direct like crystal without stain. To rig-pa basis-not-existing's essence by, delusion's cause not-existing, root separated—path not. Path not-existing, result three-realms returning-place not. That ye-from liberated-finished, sky-like dgongs-pa spontaneously-accomplished-finished. Great five liberation-manners with, common vehicles all from particularly transcended essence.

Second: five—ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol, mtha'-grol, gcig-grol's nature extensively explained.

First ye-grol: relying upon returning-basis not-existing's essence, view-meditation effort-striving dependent all shown. Ye-she pervading, generally released, made and altered not-existing's meaning. From-whence also not-arisen, to-where also not-gone, wherever not-abiding, change not-existing's meaning.

Liberation is not like untying—view-meditation by effort not-needed. Liberation called: from abiding in rang-lugs, accepting-rejecting not-existing's meaning.

Thus body-speech-mind three relaxed-settled in rang-lugs, mind itself naturally arrived—to liberation called. That also permanently thus abiding, from common vehicles transcended.
