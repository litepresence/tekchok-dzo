[12435] Give urge by death impermanent without distraction; day and night divided in sessions, always do meditation—like thus said.
[12436] Therefore, though thinking long in existence attachment-decay, life impermanent; though thinking in near moment-instant, life impermanent. Faculty and object impermanent, situation changes; retainer and wealth substance impermanent, now exist yet now not exist; father, mother, relative impermanent, not exist after passing; land person and neighbor impermanent, many separations; sun, moon, old, young impermanent, appearance changes; pleasure-pain and enemy friend impermanent, like traveler-house.
[12437] In short, all birth-beings put pillow in birth-death, wear pleasure-pain garment, spread grasping-grasped seat, take ignorance bed, sleep self-grasping sleep, dream latent-tendency dream. All goers exercising in five poisons' self-nature in three realms' samsara house, also sleeping and arising, in sleep and dream without beginning-end and wake time—think this.
[12438] Now from samsara's darkness-house, need to bring out effort in liberation's method.
[12439] Samsara-pa become by power of karma and affliction,
[12440] Though impermanent manifests, grasp as true;
[12441] Though fallen in birth-death's water-fall, liberation not known;
[12442] Though experience various sufferings, no time to forget;
[12443] True friend separate, no protector showing path,
[12444] Dharma's eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness.
[12445] Thinking these, in difficult-to-obtain leisure,
[12446] Appropriate to produce joy-mind or accomplish dharma;
[12447] Supreme become guide showing true path,
[12448] Having met mark-possessing masters,
[12449] At this time obtaining profound dharma supreme nectar,
[12450] By effort accomplish, crossing supreme other-side of existence-three ocean.
[12451] Life impermanent like setting-mountain's shadow,
[12452] Like precipice-edge tree moved by wind,
[12453] Like cloud and lightning, grass-tip dew,
[12454] Think to die quickly as self.
[12455] If now "die" not remembered from heart,
[12456] Benefit not reached at die-time by laziness-distraction;
[12457] Therefore now like falling to beginning,
[12458] Train in essence-meaning by fear-terror.
[12459] From now, self also in flower forest,
[12460] Empty by birth-beings, hearing falling-water's sound,
[12461] Dwelling near solitary, mind-pleasing cliff-mountain,
[12462] Mind of "not existent essence in four times" virtue,
[12463] Cultivated by world person as ornament-cause,
[12464] Having obtained supreme nectar than all,
[12465] May proclaim great sound of impermanent empty!
