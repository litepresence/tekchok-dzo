[4632] Thus binding body, speech, and three—
[4633] In dharmadhatu's vision,
[4634] This becomes habituation.
[4635] Thus it was said, and:
[4636] Body and speech and mind's main-point—
[4637] Know and rely, liberate from samsara.
[4638] Thus it was said.
[4639] Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
[4640] Bind three main-points in vajra seal;
[4641] Introduce awareness's own face directly;
[4642] Show vision's dawning manner from that.
[4643] First, two are:
[4644] Show general seal of three main-points,
[4645] Deliver particular self's main-point to point.
[4646] First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.
[4647] From Thalgyur:
[4648] Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
[4649] That also: gate and field itself,
[4650] Wind and awareness main-point itself seal.
[4651] Thus said.
[4652] Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
[4653] Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
[4654] Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
[4655] Three main-points also: dharmata no ground for change.
[4656] Gate main-point: cause to see;
[4657] Field main-point: cause not to change;
[4658] Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.
[4659] That also: gate main-point like threshold;
[4660] Field main-point like escort;
[4661] Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.
[4662] Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
[4663] Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
[4664] Impossible not to hit dharmata direct main-point.
[4665] That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
[4666] Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
[4667] Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
[4668] Therefore three main-points determined.
[4669] More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
[4670] Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined.
[4671] Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:
[4672] Determine general sequence of three main-points,  Deliver individual main-points to point.  First: body, speech, mind three not moving,  Gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
