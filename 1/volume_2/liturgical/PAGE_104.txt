Thus binding body, speech, and three—
In dharmadhatu's vision,
This becomes habituation.

Thus it was said, and:
Body and speech and mind's main-point—
Know and rely, liberate from samsara.

Thus it was said.

Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
Bind three main-points in vajra seal;
Introduce awareness's own face directly;
Show vision's dawning manner from that.

First, two are:
Show general seal of three main-points,
Deliver particular self's main-point to point.

First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.

From Thalgyur:
Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
That also: gate and field itself,
Wind and awareness main-point itself seal.

Thus said.

Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
Three main-points also: dharmata no ground for change.

Gate main-point: cause to see;
Field main-point: cause not to change;
Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.

That also: gate main-point like threshold;
Field main-point like escort;
Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.

Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
Impossible not to hit dharmata direct main-point.

That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
Therefore three main-points determined.

More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined.

Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:
Determine general sequence of three main-points,
Deliver individual main-points to point.

First: body, speech, mind three not moving,
Gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
