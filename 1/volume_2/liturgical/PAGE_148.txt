[6314] Also from the Ratnakuta Sutra:

[6315] The Thus-Come always born,
[6316] Non-dharma,
[6317] All dharmas like the Blissfully-Come.
[6318] Childish intellects holding marks,
[6319] Practicing non-existent dharmas in the pure world.

[6321] Also from the Samadhiraja Sutra:

[6322] When this world realm arises and
[6323] Ceases after arising, abiding empty,
[6324] Like before, so also after—
[6325] Know all dharmas thus.

[6327] From the Arya Ratnakuta Sutra:

[6328] Non-awareness like space,
[6329] All dharmas without characteristics,
[6330] Without support, without abiding, without taking—
[6331] Fully know as like emanations.

[6333] From the Guhyasamaja:

[6334] These entities unborn,
[6335] Dharma and dharmata non-existent,
[6336] Selfless like space—
[6337] This manner of enlightenment shown.

[6339] Second: two parts regarding cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind without binding or freeing:
[6340] General explanation through examining three goings of arising-places, and
[6341] Particular certainty through examining one and different.

[6342] First:

[6343] Although essence is end-free like space,
[6344] Without inner examination by self, remaining in thought "is," going like a darkness-stone through empty meditation,
[6345] Through not thinking copper-shining directly, not separating the difference-edge of samsara-nirvana,
[6346] Need discriminating wisdom for realization dawning as certain knowledge.

[6347] From the Yi ge med pa:

[6348] Although awareness nature pervades all,
[6349] Said to reach dharma instruction.

[6350] Here, to be realized through guru's instruction, three parts:
[6351] Examining arising-place and arising-agent;
[6352] Examining abiding-place and abiding-agent;
[6353] Examining going-place and going-agent.

[6354] First, from the two:
[6355] Arising place: outer various objects appearing,
[6356] Inner: aggregates appearing as form.
