[6314] [6314] Also from the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6315] [6315] The Thus-Come always born,
[6316] [6316] Non-dharma,
[6317] [6317] All dharmas like the Blissfully-Come.
[6318] [6318] Childish intellects holding marks,
[6319] [6319] Practicing non-existent dharmas in the pure world.
[6320] [6321] Also from the Samadhiraja Sutra:
[6321] [6322] When this world realm arises and
[6322] [6323] Ceases after arising, abiding empty,
[6323] [6324] Like before, so also after—
[6324] [6325] Know all dharmas thus.
[6325] [6327] From the Arya Ratnakuta Sutra:
[6326] [6328] Non-awareness like space,
[6327] [6329] All dharmas without characteristics,
[6328] [6330] Without support, without abiding, without taking—
[6329] [6331] Fully know as like emanations.
[6330] [6333] From the Guhyasamaja:
[6331] [6334] These entities unborn,
[6332] [6335] Dharma and dharmata non-existent,
[6333] [6336] Selfless like space—
[6334] [6337] This manner of enlightenment shown.
[6335] [6339] Second: two parts regarding cutting connection to great root-free emptiness of self-mind without binding or freeing:
[6336] [6340] General explanation through examining three goings of arising-places, and
[6337] [6341] Particular certainty through examining one and different.
[6338] [6342] First:
[6339] [6343] Although essence is end-free like space,
[6340] [6344] Without inner examination by self, remaining in thought "is," going like a darkness-stone through empty meditation,
[6341] [6345] Through not thinking copper-shining directly, not separating the difference-edge of samsara-nirvana,
[6342] [6346] Need discriminating wisdom for realization dawning as certain knowledge.
[6343] [6347] From the Yi ge med pa:
[6344] [6348] Although awareness nature pervades all,
[6345] [6349] Said to reach dharma instruction.
[6346] [6350] Here, to be realized through guru's instruction, three parts:
[6347] [6351] Examining arising-place and arising-agent;
[6348] [6352] Examining abiding-place and abiding-agent;
[6349] [6353] Examining going-place and going-agent.
[6350] [6354] First, from the two:
[6351] [6355] Arising place: outer various objects appearing,
[6352] [6356] Inner: aggregates appearing as form.
