Through whomsoever this wisdom meets,
Even they who bear inexpiable misdeeds,
Through habituating but to this alone—
Doubtless, they attain liberation.

Thus it is proclaimed.

The second: specific explanation of primordially-liberated ground-body, having three parts:

First, the demonstration that since liberation is finished from the beginning, at present self-liberation occurs without need for antidote of effort or striving. Second, the instruction not to transgress from the nature of that abiding-reality. Third, resting without having experienced going elsewhere from merely basisless self-dissolution in natural condition.

First: From the Pearl Garland:

Not through effort is liberation attained,
*/ From the beginning abiding liberated.

And further:

Through non-recognition itself self-occurred,
*/ Cause of delusion from the beginning purified.
*/ Kun-gzhi as dharmakaya self-appeared,
*/ Stream of birth cut at the root.
*/ Yid-bzhin dgongs-pa primordially abiding,
*/ Movement-makers self-settled.
*/ Breath from the beginning stream-cut,
*/ Birth and death from the start nonexistent.
*/ Desire's qualities primordially perfected,
*/ Attachment's extreme is cultivation itself.
*/ Limbs unmoved, primordially gone,
*/ Beings' path from the beginning traversed.
*/ Spoken speech inexpressible,
*/ From the beginning beyond speech and thought's object.
*/ Thought's emanation-gather primordially empty,
*/ From the beginning abiding in great meditation.
*/ Defilements self-purified,
*/ Defilement-less great zang-thal abiding.
*/ Through made-by not having arising-place,
*/ From the very beginning free of action and actor.
*/ From basis other-arisen dharma not existing,
*/ From the beginning self-occurred single-alone.
*/ One and two's number exhausted,
*/ Thig-le free from moon.
*/ Darkness from the beginning thoroughly purified,
*/ Rig-pa's appearance luminosity-pervading.
*/ Samsara changeless, ceased-finished,
*/ From the beginning spontaneously-perfect buddha-ground.
*/ Sign's entity empty-purified,
*/ Self-grasping thought from the beginning exhausted.
*/ Conditions by conditions self-liberated,
*/ Reference-points are cog-bzhag.

Thus.
