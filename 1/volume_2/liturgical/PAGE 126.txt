[5429] There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—
[5430] This is called "supreme instantaneous mind."

[5431] Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru, greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—such an exhaustion manner merely exists.

[5432] Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:
[5433] Essence,
[5434] Definition,
[5435] Nature,
[5436] Dharmata,
[5437] Boundary.

[5438] The essence of dharmata exhaustion:
[5439] Outer lights-five vision, together with bodies, exhausted;
[5440] Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted;
[5441] Experience vision objects exhausted,
[5442] Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially pure vision.

[5443] From the Thal 'gyur:

[5444] The vision of dharmata exhaustion—
[5445] Experience vision emptying,
[5446] Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,
[5447] Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,
[5448] Separate from words of expressive basis.

[5450] Definition:

[5451] "Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates, together with afflictions.
[5452] "Itself" is together with the part of meditating the luminosity vision of the purifying path.
[5453] "Exhaust" is "empty,"
[5454] Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—
[5455] Called "non-observation."

[5456] From that itself:

[5457] Thus the certain definition of dharmata—
[5458] To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,
[5459] Doing actions and holding characteristics,
[5460] Making self-vision empty,
[5461] Holding individual families.

[5462] "Itself" is to the unfabricated,
[5463] Pervading the real through natural abiding,
[5464] To the unfabricated, original, continuous,
[5465] Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.

[5467] Nature:

[5468] Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted, activity merely upon primordially pure self-resonance like the resonance of blue-grey sky.

[5469] From the Rtsal rdzogs:

[5470] At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion—
[5471] Like the sky, free from action.

[5473] Dharmata has two parts:
[5474] The dharmata of vision:
[5475] Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.
[5476] Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.
