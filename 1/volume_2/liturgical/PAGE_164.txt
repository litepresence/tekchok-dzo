[6957] [6957] Face-introduce mind to empty, and
[6958] [6958] From decorated face-introduction:
[6959] [6959] E ma ho: by face-introducing appearance to mind, complete to mind;
[6960] [6960] By face-introducing mind itself to empty, spread happiness to empty;
[6961] [6961] By face-introducing empty to awareness—
[6962] [6962] That only dharmakaya, awareness itself and space non-dual, appears to attach words to meaning self-characteristic.
[6963] [6963] This has intended basis,
[6964] [6964] Need purpose,
[6965] [6965] Actually harm-making valid cognition—three exist, not approaching heart-essence intention direction.
[6966] [6966] Intended basis:
[6967] [6967] For provisional purpose of grasping outer object meaning not other-to, those words said;
[6968] [6968] From Self-Arising:
[6969] [6969] Sometimes show appearance to mind.
[6970] [6970] Thus it is said.
[6971] [6971] That also: designate from only appearance to deluded mind, appearance not other-to.
[6972] [6972] Need purpose: only abandon attachment to outer objects.
[6973] [6973] Actually harm-making:
[6974] [6974] If appearance is mind, mind would be certain color shape etc. by eye etc. powers, for appearance certain as form etc. shape and color; and
[6975] [6975] Appearance mind,
[6976] [6976] Mind empty,
[6977] [6977] Empty awareness—if these three, from mutual mixing:
[6978] [6978] Conclude awareness to delusion, and
[6979] [6979] Conclude appearance not seen by eye etc., and
[6980] [6980] Conclude mind not deluded—
[6981] [6981] For these three essence substance one.
[6982] [6982] This distinction explained in detail before, and
[6983] [6983] Not liberating by making appearance mind yoga,
[6984] [6984] From Self-Arising:
[6985] [6985] Appearance mind yoga:
[6986] [6986] All arise from my mind;
[6987] [6987] What doing exists if mind itself realized?
[6988] [6988] All expressing that word—
[6989] [6989] I said not liberated.
[6990] [6990] By that scripture also harm, and
[6991] [6991] Conclude appearance non-existent when realizing mind non-existent;
[6992] [6992] From conclude appearance ceasing at time mind ceases,
[6993] [6993] Also harm from appearance existing at mind non-existent occasion.
[6994] [6994] To mind non-existent occasion: five exist.
[6995] [6995] From Middle Extremes:
