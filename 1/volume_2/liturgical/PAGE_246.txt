[10575] Knowing all these as demonic obstacles, dwell in creation-completion or accumulate great merit and make aspirations, or meditate on emptiness—this liberates.
[10576] From Awareness Self-Arisen:
[10577] When engaging mouth-words without realizing depth, becoming like madness—know this is obstacle demon. Abandon great gatherings and enter practice. Or if mindfulness is lost, this is the sign of not seeing vision—reverse the three roots.
[10578] When dakinis prophesy, this is experience-vision—settle intent upon that.
[10579] Of prophecy, there are two:
[10580] Dakini coming under one's power,
[10581] Self coming under dakini's power.
[10582] When dakini comes under one's power, all actions accomplish and deeds complete.
[10583] The method to bring dakinis under one's power: when prophecy comes during practice, do not generate attachment or joyful mind toward that, do not hold that as true—then dakini comes under one's power.
[10584] That one cannot show any meaning. Wisdom-pure dakinis do not appear in the world. Flesh-eating action dakinis come to the world, inspecting practitioners' places. They cannot liberate because form does not clearly appear.
[10585] For the authentic path, dakinis gave me the life essence at once.
[10586] When self comes under dakini's power, holding that prophecy as true, always holding to that prophecy, conducting oneself without attachment to body, saying one has transcended the extreme of result being or not-being—following that prophecy is obstacle demon approaching.
