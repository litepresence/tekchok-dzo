From the presence of Glorious Atisha:

Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—
Habituate looking at self's mind,
Like thus requested.

Third, instruction for meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death: generally, impermanent compounded dharmas resemble dream, illusion, etc. From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:

Exclamation! Compounded things are impermanent,
Characteristics of dharmas of arising and perishing;
Than becoming to perish after birth,
Therefore quick peace is bliss.

Like star, dust, eye-disease, lamp,
Magical-illusion, dew, water-bubble,
Dream, lightning, cloud—
Compounded dharmas resemble that—thus.

Especially, example of birth-being's impermanent life from the Great Secret Sun-Moon Union Tantra:

Whatever body-possessing birth-beings,
Life is impermanent like dream,
By dream establishment not exists;
Life impermanent like rushing-water,
By falling-water not exist sitting as one;
Life like grasp-not wind,
By wind birth-being seize not;
Life like short-duration emanation,
By emanation always remain not;
Life like true-not magical-illusion,
By magical-illusion true ground seize not;
Life like not-staying traveler,
By traveler always sit not;
Life like not-certain rain-cloud,
By cloud time seize not.

Thus birth-being's life extent
Is thus not certain as one,
Sudden and thunder-fall,
Time thus not seized.

From the Extensive Play Sutra:

Life impermanent like play's cloud,
Like mountain-cascade falling-water goes quick fast—thus.

From the Chapter of Especially Speaking:

Some remain in womb then die,
Likewise some after birth...
