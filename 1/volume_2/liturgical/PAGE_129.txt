[5540] [5540] This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection,
[5541] [5541] And that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through copper-shining, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—
[5542] [5542] Called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings."
[5543] [5543] Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the copper-shining—
[5544] [5544] Like the great master Vimala and
[5545] [5545] Padma.
[5546] [5546] Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,
[5547] [5547] Although buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,
[5548] [5548] Yet doing the benefit of beings until samsara is not empty, possessing self-power.
[5549] [5549] Control over birth:
[5550] [5550] At the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously,
[5551] [5551] Even insects cease into light.
[5552] [5552] Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.
[5553] [5553] Control over entry:
[5554] [5554] Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,
[5555] [5555] Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings,
[5556] [5556] Making rain of food and clothes.
[5557] [5557] Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,
[5558] [5558] If not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse;
[5559] [5559] If doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free,
[5560] [5560] Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields.
[5561] [5561] Through earth treasures,
[5562] [5562] Jewels,
[5563] [5563] Dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means,
[5564] [5564] For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.
