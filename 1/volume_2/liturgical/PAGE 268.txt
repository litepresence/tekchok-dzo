Self-clear five colors.

Continuum: from beyond two gathering of pure elements and familiar awareness own-tone, arises at time.

Division: by occasion—upward-stand, wing-arise, rim three; or like ladder sky-piercing insert, reaching sky center appearing as light house.

Result: if rim arises, liberate in first bardo; if upward-stand sky-pierce like arises, liberate without reality bardo by primordially-pure transparent-penetrate; if wing-arise, liberate at last bardo life.

If light ladder like inserts around died body or house or crematorium, liberates in wisdom four union in samadhi seven days; if light house like arises, liberates in five days upon mass appearance.

From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:

Light two:
Light arising as house way,
Light upward-stand ladder way.
That light house like obtains stability from five days, complete buddha.
That light ladder like complete buddha in seven days.

From Blazing Relics:

Light form three:
With rim around,
From whatever trace arises,
This in first bardo,
Obtain certain result.
If upward stand,
This bardo not appearing,
Buddha in instant.
If light appears from wing,
This in last bardo,
Obtain complete awakening.

That spontaneously-accomplished appearance emanation spreads, from that state emanation out-emanates to world ten directions also for beings' benefit—own-appearance reflection beings six and other-appearance self-character beings two fields, two emanations doing benefit.
