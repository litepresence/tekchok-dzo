[5830] Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing.
[5831] This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.

[5832] Moreover, body's basis, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[5833] Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.

[5834] Speech four: express basis,
[5835] Express condition,
[5836] Express object,
[5837] Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[5838] Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.

[5839] Mind four:
[5840] Memory,
[5841] No memory,
[5842] Non-arising,
[5843] Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[5844] Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.

[5845] Thus, signs dawning in body,
[5846] Known in essence-speech,
[5847] Confidence correcting mind,
[5848] Measure caught by dream,
[5849] Through diligence sequence:

[5850] Great: completely ceasing dreams,
[5851] Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.

[5852] Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[5853] No conceptuality of good or bad latency.

[5854] Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.

[5855] Thus the three abidings:
[5856] From the Mu tig phreng:

[5857] Abiding is the pure expanse,
[5858] Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[5859] Abiding are all visions.

[5861] Third, striking nails with three obtains:
[5862] Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[5863] Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[5864] Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[5865] Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."

[5866] Again from that itself:

[5867] Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[5868] Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[5869] Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.

[5871] Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[5872] Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells;
