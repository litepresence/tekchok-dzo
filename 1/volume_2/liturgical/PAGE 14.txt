[685] From the threefold extensive:
[686] Completion is—
[687] From Self-Arising:
[688] In the pure appearance of the three kayas,
[689] One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] Wisdom-appearance, uncensored and clear,
[691] Pure wisdom, light rays emanating,
[692] In awareness without concept, pure,
[693] Five light rays, uncensored and clear,
[694] In great self-liberation without grasping,
[695] Outer, inner, and secret dharmas all clear.
[696] In awareness released from action,
[697] Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in one time.
[698] In awareness separated from mind,
[699] Various appearances complete in one time.
[700] In great clear purity of self-appearance,
[701] Deluded appearance complete in one time.
[702] In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[703] Other-arisen dharmas complete in one time.
[704] Such is the way the three kayas are complete.
[705] Thus it is said.
[706] Awakened is being without the aspect of dualistic delusion—
[707] From that same source:
[708] Without action, delusion is awakened,
[709] Without concept, afflictions are awakened,
[710] Without grasping, self-arising is awakened,
[711] Without clinging, conceptual thought is awakened,
[712] Without attachment, ignorance is awakened.
[713] Such is the way the three kayas are awakened.
[714] Thus it is said.
[715] By extensive is meant:
[716] Qualities primordially spontaneously accomplished are extensive—
[717] From Self-Arising:
[718] In awareness without concept,
[719] Five lights clear, wisdom extensive,
[720] In awareness separated from actor and acted,
[721] Without perceived object, three kayas extensive,
[722] In awareness appearing without object,
[723] Without grasping mind, five lights extensive,
[724] In awareness, great wisdom,
[725] Self-appearance possessing meaning, fruit extensive.
[726] Such is the way the three kayas are extensive.
[727] Thus it is said.
[728] Second, the extensive explanation of the place:
[729] Dharmakaya,
[730] Sambhogakaya,
[731] Nirmanakaya—three extensive explanations of place.
[732] The first also has:
[733] Essence,
[734] Definition,
[735] Self-body,
[736] Metaphor,
[737] Sign,
[738] Appearance,
[739] Place,
[740] Characteristic,
[741] Object,
[742] Intent—ten in all.
[743] Essence is:
[744] Empty-clear, cessation without self-tone—
[745] From that same source:
[746] Unchanging, cessation without, pervading three:
[747] Dharmakaya's essence.
[748] Thus it is said.
[749] Definition is:
[750] The expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear light kaya being essence—primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion—
