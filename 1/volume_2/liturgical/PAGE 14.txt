[685] From the threefold expansion:
[686] Completion is this:
[687] From Self-Arising,
[688] In the pure appearance of the three kayas,
[689] One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear,
[691] Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating,
[692] In awareness free from concept, pure,
[693] Five light-rays, unceasing and clear,
[694] In great self-liberation without grasping,
[695] Outer, inner, and secret dharmas all clear.
[696] In awareness released from action,
[697] Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[698] In awareness separated from mind,
[699] All variety of appearances complete in single moment.
[700] In great clear purity of self-appearance,
[701] Deluded appearances complete in single moment.
[702] In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[703] Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[704] Such is the manner of the three kayas' completion.
[705] Thus it is said.
[706] Awakening is being without the aspect of dualistic grasping—
[707] From that same nature:
[708] Without action, delusion awakens,
[709] Without concept, afflictions awaken,
[710] Without grasping, self-arising awakens,
[711] Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens,
[712] Without attachment, ignorance awakens.
[713] Such is the manner of the three kayas' awakening.
[714] Thus it is said.
[715] By expansion is meant this:
[716] Qualities, primordially and spontaneously accomplished, are expansive—
[717] From Self-Arising,
[718] In awareness free from concept,
[719] Five lights clear, wisdom expansive,
[720] In awareness separated from actor and acted,
[721] Without perceived object, three kayas expand,
[722] In awareness appearing without object,
[723] Without grasping mind, five lights expand,
[724] In awareness, great wisdom,
[725] Self-appearance possessing meaning, fruit expands.
[726] Such is the manner of the three kayas' expansion.
[727] Thus it is said.
[728] Second: the expansive explanation of the place.
[729] Dharmakaya,
[730] Sambhogakaya,
[731] Nirmanakaya—three expansive explanations of place.
[732] The first also has:
[733] Essence,
[734] Definition,
[735] Self-body,
[736] Metaphor,
[737] Sign,
[738] Appearance,
[739] Place,
[740] Characteristic,
[741] Object,
[742] Intent—ten in total.
[743] Essence is this:
[744] Empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence—
[745] From that same nature:
[746] Unchanging, cessation without, pervading the three—
[747] Essence of dharmakaya.
[748] Thus it is said.
[749] Definition is this:
[750] The expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya being—essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion—
