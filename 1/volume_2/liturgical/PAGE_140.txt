[5907] From the Rig pa rang shar:

[5908] "Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.
[5909] In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.

[5910] That also: that person to whom introduction is shown—
[5911] First, at the time of seeing truth, joy arising to that is first ground: Very Joyful.
[5912] Recognizing that as self-vision is
[5913] Second ground: obtaining Stainless.
[5914] Then, habituation to that is

[5928] Tenth: obtaining Dharma-Cloud-Like Ground.

[5930] Those persons who abandon the shell obtain thus.

[5931] Vision ceasing delusion-vision, dawning as heap-vision is eleventh: obtaining All-Light Ground.

[5932] Then, not attaching to that vision also, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas is
[5933] Twelfth: obtaining Non-Attaching Lotus-Possessing Ground.

[5934] Then, from self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner:
