[390] These Dharmas indicating transcendence
[391] Abide completely in body and mind,
[392] Up to thus stated.
[393] Third, the manner of completeness in awareness:
[394] Again from that [source]:
[395] In whatever face of self-appearing awareness,
[396] All Dharmas appearing however are complete.
[397] Thus stated; and
[398] Thus in awareness itself:
[399] Sun and moon: method and wisdom;
[400] Male: base, female: path;
[401] Planet: measure of realization, star: Dharma;
[402] Cloud: compassion pervading all;
[403] Tree: path of expanding Dharma-nature;
[404] Mountain: view without change;
[405] Rock: Dharmakaya free from birth and destruction;
[406] Root: one cause of all Dharmas;
[407] Branch: branch of awakening itself;
[408] Trunk: one taste in emptiness;
[409] Leaf: Dharma-dimension pervading;
[410] Flower: lamp of wisdom itself;
[411] Fruit: three kayas self-complete.
[412] Sound: sound of Dharma-nature field;
[413] Smell: fame of Buddha's speech;
[414] Taste: taste of bliss of experience;
[415] Touch: great concentration.
[416] Music: complete mandala of five.
[417] Canopy: potential of clear color.
[418] Parasol: wisdom that protects.
[419] Upper-canopy: great essential point of instruction.
[420] Banner: manifest Buddha of realization.
[421] All Dharmas in the face of mind itself
[422] Abide in the manner of primordial spontaneous completion.
[423] Therefore, Dharmas of mind and entity
[424] Are all merely imputed.
[425] Thus.
[426] Second meaning, extensive explanation of inner arising—two:
[427] Division of common between and
[428] Nature of individual divisions.
[429] First:
[430] Inner arising: the five elements of essence inwardly rely upon the five coarse elements of the body;
[431] Wind and
[432] Fire and
[433] Earth and
[434] Water and
[435] Space—five, each abiding as five, twenty-five limbs.
[436] Thus, definite suitability: depending on five different functions, definite as five;
[437] From the Self-Arising:
[438] The five great elements are complete in one's own body.
[439] That also: five winds make wisdom potential;
[440] Five fires make wisdom potency;
[441] Five earths make wisdom essence;
[442] Five waters make wisdom object;
[443] Five spaces make wisdom abode. Thus.
