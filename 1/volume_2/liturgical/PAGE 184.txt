Other to entering awareness not-arising by.

Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po's tantra:
*/ Cer-grol-chen-po's view-gaze by,
*/ Buddhas beings two both liberated.

Thus.

Logical-reason: direction-free self-pure's logical-reason by established. Thus appearance cer-grol is—that itself cer-place settled, settled-place liberated, liberated-place yal because.

Liberation-manner: dharma-possessing part trained, part cer-place liberated. Wherever gone not, whence come not, wherever going-place not, wherever abiding change not. Dharma-possessing general trained, appearances all cer-grol gone.

Example: like blind-intellect temple gone, seeing-limit not.

Fourth mtha'-grol: relying upon reference apart basis-not-existing's essence. Reference what to also not-pointing essence—one's extreme from liberated is, two not-abiding, two from liberated one also not-abiding. Thus both, both not etc.

Extreme: existing's extreme appearance, not-existing's extreme not-appearance, both both not's extreme four cease—liberation called convention.

Mtha'-grol reference apart three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.

Mtha'-grol's understanding: existing, not-existing, appearing, empty's extreme—whatsoever reference not-pointing. Meaning by this is this not's reckoning beyond.

Mtha'-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.

Reason: reference-free essence reason by established. Whatsoever not-referenced, extreme apart is—extreme whatsoever abiding not. Therefore extreme-free, center not-perceived view called.
