[979] The mandalas of the five families, unmixed, clear in tone:
[980] From self-arisen:
[981] Individual colors unmixed, marks held,
[982] Marks and exemplary features excellent, light rays blazing,
[983] Father, mother, and kaya form held—
[984] These are the characteristics of Sambhogakaya.

[985] Thus it is.

[986] Fourth, the manner of appearance:
[987] From the single nature of rigpa,
[988] From the kaya of the expanse, light-kaya radiates to the directions performing benefit;
[989] The kaya of rigpa, unmoving from the expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in the field of self-appearance light-clarity, the manner of inner and outer appearance.

[990] From that itself:
[991] In one nature, two essences—
[992] This is the appearance of Sambhogakaya.

[993] Thus it is spoken.

[994] Fifth, the manner of abiding: the expanse without acceptance or rejection,
[995] The space without duality,
[996] The vast expanse of the five complete lights,
[997] Abiding in the great continuity of radiating emanations.

[998] From self-arisen:
[999] Correctly produced, without reference,
[1000] Without mind of entering or liberation,
[1001] How could grasping and engaging exist?
[1002] Beyond the words of attachment and fixation,
[1003] Beyond the two of abandoning object and abandoner,
[1004] Beyond field, mind, and intellect.
[1005] In reference-free field,
[1006] Self-appearance cuts through words—appearance.
[1007] Grasping-free, liberated in its own place,
[1008] Emanations enacted in the ten directions.
[1009] In appearance of reference-pure field,
[1010] Wisdom arises in one cut.
[1011] In appearance of reference-free field,
[1012] Marks liberate in their own place.
[1013] From that, emanations widely arise.

[1014] Thus it is spoken.

[1015] Third: extensively explained, the ground of Nirmanakaya—five aspects:
[1016] Essence,
[1017] Etymology,
[1018] Characteristic,
[1019] Division,
[1020] Method of examination.

[1021] First, the essence of Nirmanakaya: from the kaya of expanse and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya and so forth, performing benefit for others.

[1022] The etymology:
[1023] From self-arisen:
[1024] Know these etymologies of emanation-kaya:
[1025] Because appearing suitable to beings of the world realms—emanation kaya.
[1026] Because able to perform the benefit of emanation-kaya—emanation kaya.
[1027] Because performing all actions—emanation kaya.
[1028] Because able to liberate into the expanse beings beyond number—emanation kaya.
[1029] Because brief in time in one field realm—emanation kaya.
[1030] Because compassion arising without direction—emanation kaya.
[1031] Because wrathful and fierce—emanation kaya.
[1032] Because peaceful and certain—emanation kaya.
[1033] Because beings see as beautiful—emanation kaya.

[1034] Thus it is spoken.

[1035] Third, the characteristics:
