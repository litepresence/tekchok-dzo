[8632] [8632] When samadhi becomes power, recognize the lamp's face of complete purity.
[8633] [8633] When special power arises,
[8634] [8634] Recognize the spreading of samadhi's path.
[8635] [8635] When seeing the body of awareness, know without desiring mind.
[8636] [8636] When special wisdom arises in the continuum, recognize demonic deception.
[8637] [8637] When difficulty-free conduct overflows the expanse,
[8638] [8638] Recognize wisdom's direction of entry.
[8639] [8639] When emptiness pervades the field, recognize light.
[8640] [8640] When lamp appears in the field,
[8641] [8641] Recognize space and field.
[8642] [8642] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8643] [8643] When appearance comes piece by piece,
[8644] [8644] The expert must thoroughly examine.
[8645] [8645] When extremely subtle and flickering,
[8646] [8646] Through familiarity, thoroughly settle.
[8647] [8647] When fluttering, subtle, and flickering,
[8648] [8648] Through seeing, thoroughly hold.
[8649] [8649] When round, subtle, and coiling,
[8650] [8650] The expert steadies samadhi without distraction.
[8651] [8651] When sinking, blazing, and hurling appear,
[8652] [8652] Through familiarity, hold the expanding appearance.
[8653] [8653] When truly appearing in every way,
[8654] [8654] The expert explains the gathering of appearance.
[8655] [8655] When without attachment and fixation,
[8656] [8656] The expert must know the method of holding.
[8657] [8657] This is the characteristic of secret mantra familiarity.
[8658] [8658] Thus it is spoken.
[8659] [8659] Second, the day-night luminosity wheel has three aspects:
[8660] [8660] Recognizing the space-luminosity arising-base,
[8661] [8661] Demonstrating lamp-experience from that,
[8662] [8662] Determining the day-night wheel manner of meditation.
[8663] [8663] First:
[8664] [8664] Although explained formerly,
[8665] [8665] Here it is thoroughly condensed, five clear demonstrations:
[8666] [8666] The manner of space,
[8667] [8667] The manner of lamp's location,
[8668] [8668] The manner of space-awareness arising,
[8669] [8669] The manner of taking experience,
[8670] [8670] The manner of special determination.
[8671] [8671] First:
[8672] [8672] The space-luminosity bliss-gone heart essence abides without difference in all sentient beings.
[8673] [8673] From Jewel Variegated:
[8674] [8674] Like butter spontaneously present within sesame or mustard seed,
[8675] [8676] Within sentient beings appearing as bodies,
[8676] [8677] The thus-gone seed
[8677] [8678] Abides with compatible light as self-nature.
