[8642] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8643] When appearance comes piece by piece,
[8644] The expert must thoroughly examine.
[8645] When extremely subtle and flickering,
[8646] Through familiarity, thoroughly settle.
[8647] When fluttering, subtle, and flickering,
[8648] Through seeing, thoroughly hold.
[8649] When round, subtle, and coiling,
[8650] The expert steadies samadhi without distraction.
[8651] When sinking, blazing, and hurling appear,
[8652] Through familiarity, hold the expanding appearance.
[8653] When truly appearing in every way,
[8654] The expert explains the gathering of appearance.
[8655] When without attachment and fixation,
[8656] The expert must know the method of holding.
[8657] This is the characteristic of secret mantra familiarity.
[8658] Thus it is spoken.

[8665] Here it is thoroughly condensed, five clear demonstrations:
[8666] The manner of space,
[8667] The manner of lamp's location,
[8668] The manner of space-awareness arising,
[8669] The manner of taking experience,
[8670] The manner of special determination.
[8671] First:
[8672] The space-luminosity bliss-gone heart essence abides without difference in all sentient beings.
[8673] From Jewel Variegated:
[8674] Like butter spontaneously present within sesame or mustard seed,
[8676] Within sentient beings appearing as bodies,
[8677] The thus-gone seed
[8678] Abides with compatible light as self-nature.
