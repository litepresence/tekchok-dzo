Give urge by death impermanent without distraction; day and night divided in sessions, always do meditation—like thus said.

Therefore, though thinking long in existence attachment-decay, life impermanent; though thinking in near moment-instant, life impermanent. Faculty and object impermanent, situation changes; retainer and wealth substance impermanent, now exist yet now not exist; father, mother, relative impermanent, not exist after passing; land person and neighbor impermanent, many separations; sun, moon, old, young impermanent, appearance changes; pleasure-pain and enemy friend impermanent, like traveler-house.

In short, all birth-beings put pillow in birth-death, wear pleasure-pain garment, spread grasping-grasped seat, take ignorance bed, sleep self-grasping sleep, dream latent-tendency dream. All goers exercising in five poisons' self-nature in three realms' samsara house, also sleeping and arising, in sleep and dream without beginning-end and wake time—think this.

Now from samsara's darkness-house, need to bring out effort in liberation's method.

Samsara-pa become by power of karma and affliction,
Though impermanent manifests, grasp as true;
Though fallen in birth-death's water-fall, liberation not known;
Though experience various sufferings, no time to forget;
True friend separate, no protector showing path,
Dharma's eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness.

Thinking these, in difficult-to-obtain leisure,
Appropriate to produce joy-mind or accomplish dharma;
Supreme become guide showing true path,
Having met mark-possessing masters,
At this time obtaining profound dharma supreme nectar,
By effort accomplish, crossing supreme other-side of existence-three ocean.

Life impermanent like setting-mountain's shadow,
Like precipice-edge tree moved by wind,
Like cloud and lightning, grass-tip dew,
Think to die quickly as self.

If now "die" not remembered from heart,
Benefit not reached at die-time by laziness-distraction;
Therefore now like falling to beginning,
Train in essence-meaning by fear-terror.

From now, self also in flower forest,
Empty by birth-beings, hearing falling-water's sound,
Dwelling near solitary, mind-pleasing cliff-mountain,
Mind of "not existent essence in four times" virtue,
Cultivated by world person as ornament-cause,
Having obtained supreme nectar than all,
May proclaim great sound of impermanent empty!
