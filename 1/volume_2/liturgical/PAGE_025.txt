[1252] To path-trained appearance manner;
[1253] Intermediate state appearance manner.
[1254] First:
[1255] Although light radiantly abides in oneself, to six realms not knowing own face, now lamp's self-light exists in subtle portions.
[1256] From that itself:
[1257] To all unrealized beings:
[1258] In humans, example-exists;
[1259] In gods, visible;
[1260] In demigods, subtly exists;
[1261] In animals, merely in own abode;
[1262] In hungry ghosts, flickers;
[1263] In hell realms, like sesame grain—
[1264] Thus six lights abide.
[1265] Thus spoken.
[1266] That light also merely tone existing inside heart.
[1267] By nature, ripening-result latencies' light exists in gods as distant visibility, etcetera;
[1268] Contaminated ripening-result virtue's light,
[1269] Not heart essence's self-light.
[1270] Second: to path-trained appearance manner—nine aspects: light abode,
[1271] Path,
[1272] Field,
[1273] Body,
[1274] Eye,
[1275] Essence,
[1276] Example and simile,
[1277] Time,
[1278] Liberation place.
[1279] Abode: In heart, five spontaneously accomplished lights' thigle, in five colors' center, five kayas father-mother cluster mandala abiding,
[1280] Five elements,
[1281] Five aggregates,
[1282] Five kayas,
[1283] Five families,
[1284] Five wisdoms,
[1285] Five grounds' purity abiding;
[1286] From four appearances,
[1287] Seen when measure arrives.
[1288] Path: Distant visibility arising;
[1289] Field: Empty sky;
[1290] Light body:
[1291] Five kayas and four wisdoms' upward appearances.
[1292] Eye:
[1293] Through wisdom's self-arisen lamp, knowing own face and moving to expanse.
[1294] Essence:
[1295] All-clear, non-ceasing wisdom.
[1296] Example and simile: Like crystal,
[1297] Although five lights in ground-abiding self not clear, they exist as arising ground.
[1298] When conditions experientially taken and intermediate state lamp, ground-appearance fills sky with five lights.
[1300] Time: If experientially taken, can also appear in this life;
[1301] Intermediate state naturally arising time.
[1302] Liberation place: To first primordially pure jewel secret cavity,
