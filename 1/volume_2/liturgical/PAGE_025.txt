[1252] [1252] To path-trained appearance manner;
[1253] [1253] Intermediate state appearance manner.
[1254] [1254] First:
[1255] [1255] Although light radiantly abides in oneself, to six realms not knowing own face, now lamp's self-light exists in subtle portions.
[1256] [1256] From that itself:
[1257] [1257] To all unrealized beings:
[1258] [1258] In humans, example-exists;
[1259] [1259] In gods, visible;
[1260] [1260] In demigods, subtly exists;
[1261] [1261] In animals, merely in own abode;
[1262] [1262] In hungry ghosts, flickers;
[1263] [1263] In hell realms, like sesame grain—
[1264] [1264] Thus six lights abide.
[1265] [1265] Thus spoken.
[1266] [1266] That light also merely tone existing inside heart.
[1267] [1267] By nature, ripening-result latencies' light exists in gods as distant visibility, etcetera;
[1268] [1268] Contaminated ripening-result virtue's light,
[1269] [1269] Not heart essence's self-light.
[1270] [1270] Second: to path-trained appearance manner—nine aspects: light abode,
[1271] [1271] Path,
[1272] [1272] Field,
[1273] [1273] Body,
[1274] [1274] Eye,
[1275] [1275] Essence,
[1276] [1276] Example and simile,
[1277] [1277] Time,
[1278] [1278] Liberation place.
[1279] [1279] Abode: In heart, five spontaneously accomplished lights' thigle, in five colors' center, five kayas father-mother cluster mandala abiding,
[1280] [1280] Five elements,
[1281] [1281] Five aggregates,
[1282] [1282] Five kayas,
[1283] [1283] Five families,
[1284] [1284] Five wisdoms,
[1285] [1285] Five grounds' purity abiding;
[1286] [1286] From four appearances,
[1287] [1287] Seen when measure arrives.
[1288] [1288] Path: Distant visibility arising;
[1289] [1289] Field: Empty sky;
[1290] [1290] Light body:
[1291] [1291] Five kayas and four wisdoms' upward appearances.
[1292] [1292] Eye:
[1293] [1293] Through wisdom's self-arisen lamp, knowing own face and moving to expanse.
[1294] [1294] Essence:
[1295] [1295] All-clear, non-ceasing wisdom.
[1296] [1296] Example and simile: Like crystal,
[1297] [1297] Although five lights in ground-abiding self not clear, they exist as arising ground.
[1298] [1298] When conditions experientially taken and intermediate state lamp, ground-appearance fills sky with five lights.
[1299] [1300] Time: If experientially taken, can also appear in this life;
[1300] [1301] Intermediate state naturally arising time.
[1301] [1302] Liberation place: To first primordially pure jewel secret cavity,
[1302]
