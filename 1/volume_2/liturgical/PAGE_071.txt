[3301] By holding mind on one white-A hovering in sky bow-length from crown.

[3302] First clear A, then that also not-exist, other thought not-change, arise clear half-essence, meditate in that state.

[3303] These very important points by experience, very effort do.

[3304] Fifth, transference: three aspects.

[3305] Great: clear-light transference.

[3306] Medium: illusory-body transference.

[3307] Finally: body-speech transference.

[3308] That is not three transference places.

[3309] Three capacities of transference-doer.

[3310] Some apply three transference, other is.

[3311] Here, if self masters clear-light, death-time from that state extract awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu.

[3312] If master illusory-body, death-time from illusory-body state project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmata meaning deity-form, hold bardo illusory-body, buddha.

[3313] If those two not mastered, depend body-speech-mind three points channel-wind, transference to Brahma-aperture, and.

[3314] From Thalgyur:

[3315] Three aspect transference types.

[3316] By sense distinction.

[3317] Clear-light and illusory-body and.

[3318] Upon finally body-speech mind.

[3327] By train dependent relate.

[3328] By individual element internal harmony.

[3329] Accomplish body-speech-mind focus.

[3330] Actual-not: show mind familiar power.

[3331] Thus it is.

[3332] Brahma-aperture is transference path.

[3333] From Four Vajra Seats:

[3334] From upper nine apertures.

[3335] If immediately do mind transference.

[3336] Day like kill Brahmin, and.

[3337] Also do five borderless.
