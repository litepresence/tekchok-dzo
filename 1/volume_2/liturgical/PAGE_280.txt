[12121] The ground boundary of the intermediate state of remaining in nature is from exiting the mother's womb until struck by the disease of the final death condition.
[12122] From there until breath is cut by gasping is the death-time intermediate state.
[12123] From inner breath being cut, clear light arises; the interval of spontaneously accomplished appearance is the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12124] From there, spontaneously accomplished dissolves, appearing like flashing dreams until entering the mother's womb is the ground boundary of the existence intermediate state.
[12125] These introductions shown at the final time of death are called the instruction of giving a robe-shake to the traveler crossing.
[12126] That traveler has entered the path of death.
[12127] The suffering of death is great,
[12128] And if the various path appearances are not known as own-appearance, there is danger of arising as enemies.
[12129] If known, there is danger of appearing as helpers.
[12130] To hit that shake at death,
[12131] Is called the instruction of hitting with robe-shake; the example and meaning fit.
[12132] These are the general establishment of the intermediate state.
[12133] There is need to divide in half for ease.
[12134] Second, regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are four:
[12135] For the intermediate state of nature, the tone-instruction like entering a box with rope cut, deciding the class of knowables,
[12136] For the death-time intermediate state, the instruction like looking in a beautiful woman's mirror, giving clarity to what is unclear,
[12137] For the dharmatā intermediate state, the instruction like meeting a familiar person or a child entering the mother's lap through confidence in own-appearance,
[12138] For the existence intermediate state, the instruction like inserting a fox into a broken fox hole through the continuity of karma.
[12139] First:
[12140] Before doing the entering-box, examine whether caught or not caught by the enemy of harm; without harm, with the box ready, whenever entering that box later, no need to cut superimpositions, without doubt,
[12141] And without obstruction or attachment, entering like that yogin, first desiring liberation from saṃsāra, examining which method is profound and which point is great, abandoning three—deciding the limit of that Dharma of self-confidence, entering with doubt, and not arriving at the beginning.
