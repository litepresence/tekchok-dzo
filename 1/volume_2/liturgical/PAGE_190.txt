[8083] Samsara name-only repeat—life that, light liberated particular entered.
[8084] From Thal-'gyur:
[8085] */ This self-object shown from,
[8086] */ Circumstantial-conditions entering not.
[8087] */ Zang-ma and thal-byung,
[8088] */ Object awareness appearance aspect from,
[8089] */ Straight self basis from liberated.
[8090] Thus.
[8091] Well: khregs-chod manifested also, appearance measure not-reached, aggregates liberated shown—particular what? Very great: khregs-chod by manifested also, atom part-not from, light go not-possible. Light gone-not, vajra-body not-established. Occasional illusion-body, final not-decide. Light-body not-attained, transference great body not-attained—other benefit vast, support that not-accomplish because. Light atom dissolve portion from: transference great benefit not-do, clairvoyance and miracle accomplish, vast small particular existing.
[8092] Second: rig-pa ye-from luminosity spoken, that khregs-chod by empty measure, self-light not-see that. Thod-rgal by essence-held, dharmata essence luminosity inside captured time, dharma-possessing self-resound luminosity outside appearance technique shown existing—transcended.
[8093] From Rang-shar:
[8094] */ Self-appearance rig-pa's king this,
[8095] */ All existing, realization not.
[8096] Thus.
[8097] Third: rig-pa's ye-she khregs-chod see-not, cover addition, see not one decide that. Thod-rgal ye-she's sight open, dharmata's sun-rays clear.
[8098] From Thal-'gyur:
[8099] */ Dharmata direct appearance by,
[8100] */ Intellect grasping view suppressed.
[8101] Thus.
[8102] Fourth: khregs-chod coarse nerve-wind dependent, thod-rgal light-nerve clear recognized, lamp actual path made.
[8103] That from:
[8104] */ Also nerve delusion-mandala by,
[8105] */ Nature appearance ye-she five,
[8106] */ Bubble eye see.
[8107] Thus.
