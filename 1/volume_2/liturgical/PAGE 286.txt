For dharma alone benefits; other than dharma, nothing reaches benefit. From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:

Here father, mother, relatives,
Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;
Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.
Except these quality-possessors,
No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.

From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:

As time's danger, king becoming to go,
Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;
Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,
Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.

Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay: having obtained such difficult leisure, yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded, like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation dharma.

Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion? From the Ratnagotra Tantra:

In coarse element forms,
Alas, no ground to sit;
To birth-being's stable life breath,
Alas, time does not strike;
In group six's object appearance,
Alas, nothing permanent;
In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
Alas, nothing exhausts;
In suffering arisen from body,
Alas, nothing pure—thus.

Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused. Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others, enemies conquered, lands obtained—yet doing whatever, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
