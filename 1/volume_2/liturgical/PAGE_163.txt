[6919] Great method of appearance just-place awareness:
[6920] Appearance great: not basis of all;
[6921] Appear like five element Buddhas' path;
[6922] Five greats: mother itself clear as appearance;
[6923] In not-wandering nature: place great grasping-non-existent.

[6924] Thus it is said.

[6925] Third: placing three vital points of dharmata's wheel in great sky-equal space-clarity has three:
[6926] Instruction placing mind itself action-separate by nature of dharmata's separation from effort-exertion;
[6927] Instruction concepts dawning as primordial wisdom by vital point of dharmata's self-direct introduction;
[6928] Instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata's liberation from self-place.

[6929] First:
[6930] That nature separate from action: not realized by action, realized by non-action place—place three doors self-settled vast.

[6931] From Thalgyur:
[6932] Also other action-separate dharmata:
[6933] Liberate-to liberate by action non-existent.

[6934] Thus said, and:
[6935] From Great Garuda:
[6936] Therefore if samsara-nirvana action-action itself separate,
[6937] What other doing exists from this great perfection?

[6938] Thus said, and:
[6939] From Six Objects:
[6940] Basis place by separating from action.

[6941] Second:
[6942] Face-introduce appearance as mind's play;
[6943] Face-introduce play basis-non-existent clear appearance;
[6944] Face-introduce as delusion if grasp clear appearance;
[6945] Face-introduce self-clear non-existent appearance by non-grasping—decide outer object appearance and mind other-to non-established, empty object of samsara birth.

[6946] Also face-introduce appearance-grasping mind that basis-non-existent;
[6947] Face-introduce basis-non-existent empty self-course;
[6948] Face-introduce self-course track-non-existent primordially liberated—
[6949] Circle-maker self-mind liberated basis-non-existent, echo in three realms name-non-existent dharmata.

[6950] From Perfection:
[6951] Nature dharma-nature peace: perception object-to non-existent;
[6952] Entity non-existent itself: appearance self-search self-appearance;
[6953] Self meaning dharma-nature: appearance mind separate;
[6954] Look self object: not making send-gather.

[6955] Thus it is said.

[6956] Here some face-introduce appearance to mind.
