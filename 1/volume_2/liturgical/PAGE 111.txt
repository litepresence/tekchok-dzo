Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.
Though awareness vision arrives at measure,
If not changing from that to other,
Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit
From actual vision-mark dharmas.

Vision-experience dissolves into base;
Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;
Experience dharmata exhaustion,
Dharmata-exhausting vision arises.

Those also: first two—nirmanakaya;
Measure-arriving—sambhogakaya;
Exhausting—dharmakaya vision.
Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn,
Arrive at fruit dharmata-exhausting pure dhatu—cause.

Self-vision potency dissolves
Into three-bodies' awareness mode;
Awareness pure fruit,
Originally from awareness dhatu,
Self-potency three-bodies dawn,
Called functioning fruit.

Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;
Vehicle king: called intent.

This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.

Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are:
Dharmata direct,
Experience increasing above,
Awareness measure-arriving,
Extensively explain dharmata-exhausting vision.

First, two are:
General direct connection place,
Identify self-characteristic.

First: general direct—conventional term famous direct,
And ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—two from;
First: sense-power direct—form etcetera, object five, vision nature,
And mind direct—object near enjoy, cause certain, conceptuality object in vision,
And self-awareness direct—within pleasure pain etcetera experience called vision,
And yogin's direct itself—meaning near meet, actual point enter,
Particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state,
Grasp-hold-separate experience certainty.
