[751-756] [PHILOLOGY] Definition Continued: Six Metaphors for Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** The definition (*nges tshig*) of dharmakaya continues, emphasizing it as:
- Naturally spontaneous (*rang bzhin lhun grub*) - not fabricated
- Clear-light kaya (*'od gsal gyi sku*) - the luminous dimension
- Great self-abiding (*rang gnas chen po*) - autonomous presence

The citation (*de nyid las*) adds: "Fearless, empty, and clear, all actions complete" (*mi 'jigs stong dang gsal ba dang / bya ba thams cad rdzogs pa*). "Fearless" (*mi 'jigs*) indicates the ground's transcendence of all threatening conditions.

[757-762] [CONCEPT] Self-Body (*rang lus*) as Freedom from Elaboration
**Analysis:** The self-body is defined negatively: "freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere" (*spros pa'i mtha' thams cad dang bral bas gang du'ang grub pa med pa*). 

The *rang shar* citation eliminates spatial categories:
- Without outer (*phyi med*)
- Without inner (*nang med*)  
- Without within expanse (*dbyings su med*)

This threefold negation (*med gsum*) reflects the Madhyamaka analysis of dharmakaya as unlocatable and ungraspable.

[763-774] [CONTEXT] Six Metaphors (*mtshon dpe drug*) for Dharmakaya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents six natural metaphors, each corresponding to a quality:

| Metaphor | Quality | Correspondence |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Sun (*nyi ma*) | Clear-light awareness (*rig pa 'od gsal*) | Illuminating |
| Ocean (*rgya mtsho*) | Depth (*zab pa*) | Unfathomable |
| Lotus (*padma*) | Unstained by defects (*skyon gyis gos pa med pa*) | Purity |
| Mountain (*ri bo*) | Unchanging (*mi 'gyur ba*) | Stability |
| Space (*nam mkha'*) | Vast without boundary/center (*yangs la mtha' dbus med pa*) | Pervasion |
| Lion (*seng ge*) | Confidence surpassing all (*thams cad zil gnon gyi gdeng*) | Power |

The citation collapses these into "three" (*gsum*), likely grouping: (1) sun/ocean/lotus as luminosity/depth/purity, (2) mountain/space as stability/vastness, and (3) lion as sovereign power.

[775-779] [CONCEPT] Sign (*rtags*) as Transcendence of Movement
**Analysis:** The sign of dharmakaya is "transcending going and coming" (*'gro 'ong las 'das pa*). The *rang shar* citation presents the threefold transcendence:
- Without going (*'gro med*)
- Without coming (*'ong med*)
- Without abiding (*gnas pa med*)

This negates all categories of motion, establishing dharmakaya as the unmoved mover, the static ground of dynamic appearance.

[780-784] [PHILOLOGY] Appearance (*snang ba*) as Empty-Clarity
**Analysis:** Appearance is "like the empty-clarity of sky's expanse" (*stong gsal nam mkha'i dbyings lta bu*). The *rang shar* citation:
- *'gag med* (unceasing) - appearance continues without interruption
- *gsal gdangs* (clear tone/resonance) - the sonorous display  
- *ngo bos stong* (empty by essence) - without inherent existence

This triad (*'gag med/gsal gdangs/ngo bos stong*) encapsulates the Dzogchen view of appearance as luminosity-emptiness inseparable.

[785-789] [CONCEPT] Place (*gnas*) as Pure Memory-Thought
**Analysis:** The place is "great pure memory-thought" (*dran bsam rnam dag chen po*). The citation presents threefold freedom:
- Without limit (*dpag med*) - not measurable
- Without object (*dmigs med*) - not graspable
- Without grasping (*'dzin pa med*) - not fixated

This indicates dharmakaya as the "place" (*gnas*) that is no-place, the unlocatable ground of all location.

[790-795] [CONTEXT] Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*) as Triune Inseparability
**Analysis:** The characteristic is the inseparability (*dbyer med pa*) of the triad:
- Essence (*ngo bo*)
- Nature (*rang bzhin*)
- Compassion (*thugs rje*)

This reflects the classic Dzogchen *ngo bo/rang bzhin/thugs rje* triad, mapping onto:
- Dharmakaya (essence/emptiness)
- Sambhogakaya (nature/luminosity)
- Nirmanakaya (compassion/appearance)

[796-802] [PHILOLOGY] Object (*yul*) as Triple Inseparability
**Analysis:** The object (*yul*) is analyzed through three aspects:
1. Self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut (*stong pa phyang ma chad pas rig pa rang gsal*)
2. Adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished self-tone (*'od lngas brgyan pas lhun grub rang gdangs*)
3. Great inseparability of expanse and awareness, aspects individually unmixed (*dbyings rig dbyer med chen po la rnam pa so sor ma 'dres pa*)

The *rang shar* citation condenses this to: clear (*gsal*), luminous (*gdangs*), and unmixed (*ma 'dres*)—three.

[803-806] [STRUCTURE] Intent (*dgongs pa*): View, Meditation, Conduct
**Analysis:** The intent is presented as threefold practice instruction:

1. **View** (*lta ba*): "Unsevered by direction or side" (*phyogs dang ris su ma chad pa*) - transcendence of all partial perspectives
2. **Meditation** (*sgom pa*): "Not established as entity or sign" (*dngos po dang mtshan mar ma grub pa*) - non-reification of experience
3. **Conduct** (*spyod pa*): "Transcending both apprehending and grasping" (*gzung 'dzin gnyis bcas las 'das pa*) - beyond subject-object duality

This initiates the practical application of dharmakaya theory, transitioning from descriptive ontology to prescriptive soteriology.
