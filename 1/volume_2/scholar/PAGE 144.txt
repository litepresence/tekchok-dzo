[STRUCTURE]
This page continues the catalog of negations and affirmations, now focusing on the *yang sangs* (vastly awake) and *lhun rdzogs* (spontaneously complete) qualities. The structure maintains the list format but introduces new semantic domains: the spontaneous (*lhun gyis*) versus the effortful (*byas pa*), the natural flow (*lhug par*) versus constructed practice. The page appears to continue the first of three aspects under "pointing out essence" (*ngo rang thog tu dbab pa*), specifically the section on establishing Great Perfection as sky-like primordial purity beyond acceptance and rejection. The enumerative style creates a hypnotic rhythm of negation that serves the pedagogical function of exhausting conceptual proliferation (*prapañca*).

[PHILOLOGY]
Key terms: *lhun rdzogs* (spontaneously complete), *yang sangs* (vastly awake), *lhug par* (flowingly/naturally), *byas pa* (fabricated/made), *rtsol ba* (effort), *sbyangs pa* (purification/cultivation). The construction *...las 'das pa* continues from previous pages. The compound *lta sgom spyod* (view, meditation, conduct) represents the three pillars of Buddhist practice that Dzogchen claims to transcend. The particle *gyis* appears in instrumental function: *gnas lugs gyis* (by the natural condition), *ye shes gyis* (by wisdom). The term *dbal* (vivid/intense) in *dbal 'phrang* (vivid display) relates to the *dbal* (power/vividness) of Atiyoga. The suffix *-med* continues to mark absences: *rtsol med*, *bsgom med*, *sgrub med*.

[CONTEXT]
The critique of *byas pa* (fabricated/made) versus *ma byas pa* (unfabricated) reflects the ancient Buddhist distinction between *samskrta* (conditioned) and *asamskrta* (unconditioned), but applied here to the path itself. The transcendence of *lta sgom spyod* (view, meditation, conduct) distinguishes Atiyoga from the three lower tantra categories (*kriya/upaya/yoga*) and even from Mahayoga and Anuyoga. The term *lhun gyis grub* (spontaneously accomplished) is the Dzogchen equivalent of *anabhoga* (effortless) in Indian Buddhism. The reference to *sbyangs pa* (purification) critiques the gradual purification model of the Bodhisattva path (*byang chub sems dpa'i lam*).

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *lhun rdzogs* (spontaneously complete) is the Dzogchen answer to the Madhyamaka *asamskrta*: not merely "unconditioned" in the negative sense, but spontaneously perfected in the positive sense. The threefold transcendence - of view and meditation (*lta sgom las 'das*), of conduct (*spyod las 'das*), and of path (*lam las 'das*) - represents the progressive "deconstruction" of Buddhist practice from the Dzogchen perspective. The distinction between *byas pa* (made) and *lhun gyis grub* (spontaneously accomplished) parallels the *satkaryavada* versus *asatkaryavada* debate in Indian philosophy but resolves it through the recognition that nothing is ever created or destroyed in awareness. The "flowing wisdom" (*lhug par ye shes*) describes the quality of awareness as unimpeded natural manifestation, not frozen in conceptual ice. This anticipates the *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) teachings where wisdom "flows" as spontaneous light.
