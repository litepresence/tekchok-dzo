[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2387-2446]
Page 48 presents the fruit section ('bras bu) of the appearance-power-transform conduct and transitions to the second major category: meditation-progressive-yogin (bsgom pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor). The structural organization follows:

1. Fruit of aggregates-elements-sense-fields liberation (lines 2387-2421)
2. Fourfold division of meditation yogin (lines 2422-2426)
3. Threefold division of sun-mouth-join meditation (lines 2427-2432)
4. Citation from Thal 'gyur on meditation definition (lines 2433-2445)
5. Transition to mind-holding twenty-one (line 2446)

The page integrates the conclusion of the conduct section with the opening of the meditation section, using the Mu tig phreng ba (Pearl Garland) and Klong drug pa (Six Vastnesses) as primary scriptural sources.

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: phung po khams dang skye mched] - Wylie: phung po khams dang skye mched. "Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields." The standard Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit skandha-dhatu-ayatana—the threefold analysis of conditioned existence in Abhidharma literature. The aggregate (phung po; Skt. skandha) analysis comprises form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. The element (khams; Skt. dhatu) analysis comprises the eighteen elements. The sense-field (skye mched; Skt. ayatana) analysis comprises the twelve sense-bases.

[TERM: rigs dang rigs kyi bdag po] - Wylie: rigs dang rigs kyi bdag po. "Family and family's lord." Technical tantric terminology: rigs (Skt. gotra or kula) indicates the buddha-family or clan, while rigs kyi bdag po (Skt. kulesha) indicates the head or lord of that family (the principal deity). The phrase indicates liberation through identification with the appropriate deity family.

[TERM: rkyen gyis grol ba] - Wylie: rkyen gyis grol ba. "Liberated by conditions." Technical phrase indicating the Dzogchen doctrine that phenomena self-liberate through their own conditions without requiring intervention. This reflects the principle of rang grol (self-liberation).

[TERM: dmigs pa'i chos] - Wylie: dmigs pa'i chos. "Observed dharmas" or "referent objects." Technical epistemological term for phenomena that serve as the objects of perception or cognition. The phrase indicates that liberation occurs without reliance on conceptual referents.

[TERM: gzung 'dzin] - Wylie: gzung 'dzin. "Grasping and holding" or "apprehended and apprehender." Technical term for the subject-object duality. Gzung (apprehended, grasped) indicates the object; 'dzin (holder, grasper) indicates the subject. Liberation in the object itself transcends this duality.

[TERM: 'khor 'das gnyis] - Wylie: 'khor 'das gnyis. "The two: samsara and nirvana." Standard designation for the fundamental dichotomy of cyclic existence and liberation. Dzogchen teachings aim at transcending this apparent opposition.

[TERM: tha snyad tshig] - Wylie: tha snyad tshig. "Conventional words" or "designative language." Technical term for conceptual, linguistic designation as distinct from ultimate reality. The phrase nga mi ltos (I do not rely) indicates transcendence of linguistic/conceptual mediation.

[TERM: mtshon byed blo] - Wylie: mtshon byed blo. "Indicating mind." Technical term for conceptual consciousness that indicates or points to objects. The ultimate truth transcends this indicating function.

[TERM: rtog tshogs] - Wylie: rtog tshogs. "Thought-assemblies." Technical term for the collections of conceptual thought that constitute ordinary mind. The phrase indicates that these self-purify in their own place.

[TERM: nyin mtshan kha sbyor] - Wylie: nyin mtshan kha sbyor. "Day-night mouth-join." Technical term indicating continuous practice without interruption, joining day and night into seamless awareness. This is the highest level of meditative application.

[TERM: rgya mtsho cog bzhag] - Wylie: rgya mtsho cog bzhag. "Ocean direct-placement." Technical meditation term indicating vast, open resting like the ocean. The rgya mtsho (ocean) metaphor indicates limitless, unbounded awareness.

[TERM: chos nyid gzhi bzhag] - Wylie: chos nyid gzhi bzhag. "Dharmata ground-placement." Technical term for meditation that rests directly in the nature of phenomena (dharmata) as the ground (gzhi) of all appearance.

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Mu tig phreng ba] - Lines 2387-2401 cite the Pearl Garland (Mu tig phreng ba), a Nyingma tantra. The passage presents the self-liberation of all conditioned categories:
- Aggregates-elements-sense-fields liberate in family and family's lord
- Conditions liberate in conditions → no reliance on observed dharmas
- Objects liberate in objects → no reliance on grasping-holding
- Cause liberates in cause → no reliance on samsara-nirvana
- Dharmas liberate in dharmas → no reliance on concepts-words
- Mind-itself liberates in mind → no reliance on indicating mind

This systematic presentation of self-liberation (rang grol) establishes the theoretical basis for non-meditation meditation.

[CITATION: Klong drug pa - Continuation] - Lines 2402-2421 cite the Six Vastnesses on the self-purification of all phenomena in mind-itself:
- Six-aggregates appearance: thought-assemblies self-place pure
- Sounds-words appearance: concepts-names self-place pure
- Coarse appearance: four-elements' conditions self-place pure
- Grasping-holding appearance: binding self-grasp pure
- Existence appearance: phenomena self-place pure
- Non-existence appearance: emptinesses self-place pure
- Existence-non-existence: establishing extremes self-place pure
- Dharma appearance: own-characteristics pure
- Non-dharma appearance: delusions self-place pure

This exhaustive enumeration demonstrates the universal scope of self-purification.

[CITATION: Thal 'gyur] - Lines 2433-2445 cite the Thal 'gyur (Consequence) tantra defining meditation:
- Born from nature's descent (rang bzhin babs las byung ba) = samadhi
- Channels, winds, thigle = meditation
- Body piths, eyes, emptiness = meditation
- Letters, light, color = samadhi
- Emanation's spread-gather = concentration
- Unfabricated natural settling = buddhas' intention

This presents both tantric (channels-winds-thigle) and Dzogchen (unfabricated settling) definitions.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Self-Liberation vs. Path Purification] - The page contrasts the Dzogchen doctrine of rang sar dag (self-place pure) with the Sarma doctrine of path purification (lam sbyang). In Dzogchen, phenomena are already pure; practice is recognition, not transformation. This reflects the fundamental Nyingma-Sarma distinction regarding the nature of enlightenment.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Sixfold Liberation Formula] - The Mu tig phreng ba citation presents a consistent formula: [phenomenon] + [liberation in itself] + [non-reliance on concept]. This structure applies across:
1. Aggregates-elements-sense-fields
2. Conditions
3. Objects
4. Causes
5. Dharmas
6. Mind-itself

The pattern indicates that liberation is not achieved by removing phenomena but by recognizing their intrinsic self-liberation without conceptual elaboration.

[ANALYSIS: Ninefold Self-Purification] - The Klong drug pa citation presents nine modes of self-purification:
1. Thought-assemblies (six aggregates)
2. Concepts-names (sounds-words)
3. Four-elements' conditions (coarse appearances)
4. Binding self-grasp (grasping-holding)
5. Phenomena (existence appearance)
6. Emptinesses (non-existence appearance)
7. Establishing extremes (existence-non-existence)
8. Own-characteristics (dharma appearance)
9. Delusions (non-dharma appearance)

This comprehensive enumeration leaves nothing outside the scope of self-purification.

[ANALYSIS: Fourfold Meditation Yogin] - Lines 2422-2426 present the four aspects of meditation-progressive-yogin:
1. Day-night mouth-join meditation (nyin mtshan kha sbyor gyi sgom pa)
2. Instruction: ocean direct-placement method (rgya mtsho cog bzhag gi thabs)
3. Intention: dharmata ground-placement of appearance-existence (snang srid gzhi bzhag gi chos nyid)
4. Fruit: afflictions self-pacified suppression (nyon mongs pa rang rgyal btab pa)

This mirrors the fourfold structure of the conduct section: practice, method, aim, result.

[ANALYSIS: Threefold Meditation Definition] - Lines 2428-2432 present three categories of meditation:
1. Lha la sogs pa'i sems kyi sgom pa - Deity etc. mind meditation (tantric visualization)
2. Theg pa chen po'i bsam gtan - Mahayana dhyana (sutra meditation)
3. Dus gsum gyi sangs rgyas thams cad kyi dgongs pa - Intention of all buddhas of three times (Dzogchen)

This triadic structure accommodates practitioners at different levels while pointing to the ultimate Dzogchen meditation as the intention of all buddhas.
