[7628-7689] [STRUCTURE] Five Liberations and Nine Assertions
**Analysis:** This page presents the five types of liberation (*grol ba lnga*) and nine assertions (*thag chod dgu*) that characterize Dzogchen's unique approach. The structure establishes: (1) liberation through mere settling (*bzhag pa tsam gyis grol ba*), (2) liberation through mere knowing (*shes pa tsam gyis grol ba*), (3) primordial liberation (*ye grol*), (4) self-liberation (*rang grol*), (5) naked liberation (*cer grol*).

[7628-7632] [PHILOLOGY] Five Liberations
**Analysis:** The fivefold typology:
- *Bzhag pa tsam gyis grol ba*: liberation through mere settling/placement
- *Shes pa tsam gyis grol ba*: liberation through mere knowing/awareness
- *Ye grol*: primordial liberation (never bound)
- *Rang grol*: self-liberation (spontaneous release)
- *Cer grol*: naked liberation (stripped of all constructs)

Each represents a different aspect of Dzogchen's non-action approach.

[7672-7674] [CONCEPT] Simile of Fruit
**Analysis:** The simile of *a li ka'i 'bras bu* (āli-kā fruit) illustrates primordial ripeness:
- Fruit primordially ripe (*ye nas smin pa*)
- No need for further ripening (*da smin rgyu med pa*)
- Already accomplished, not needing cause

This distinguishes Dzogchen from gradualist paths requiring cultivation.

[7675-7689] [STRUCTURE] Understanding Primordial Liberation
**Analysis:** The three aspects of *ye grol*:
1. **Understanding** (*go ba*): recognition of primordial freedom
2. **Placement** (*'jog pa*): resting in natural state
3. **Validity** (*'thad pa*): logical demonstration

[7686-7689] [CONTEXT] Causal Vehicle Critique
**Analysis:** The text distinguishes Dzogchen from lower approaches:
- Not relying on other conditions (*yul gzhan la brten pa'i bsgom pa*)
- Not adopting views that accept/reject (*lta ba*)
- Not engaging in conduct with faults (*spyod pa skyon can*)

The phrase *ye nas dag pa'i phyir ro* (because primordially pure) establishes the logical basis for non-action.
