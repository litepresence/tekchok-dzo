[1849-1858] [CONCEPT] Great Completion Non-Training
**Analysis:** The path purifies three gates' defilements and aggregates with dross. When pure, lower paths complete incidentally. The Great Completion view: upper completion makes lower complete spontaneously without training. Ground is one: rigpa spontaneously accomplished. All activities without transformation or training—rigpa spontaneously complete.

[1859-1908] [STRUCTURE] Yogin Qualifications
**Analysis:** Section on supreme abode with two parts: general yogin distinction and particular vessel-person explanation. Eight qualities required: guru respect, generosity, faith, wisdom, diligence, shame regarding non-virtue, weariness of samsara, devotion to Great Completion. From Thal 'gyur: view-meditation holder needs faith, diligence, generosity, guru respect, vows, shame. Alternative: long slow nature, dull lazy, small concept, slow nature.

[1944-1958] [CONTEXT] Physical Marks
**Analysis:** Great Completion vessel marks: male or female, specific color, thick limbs, conch-white teeth, red eye corners, right-curling black hair, small body-respect, normal outer conduct, forceful words, or words spoken as person speaks.

[1991-2005] [PHILOLOGY] Wandering Yogi
**Analysis:** From Precious Instruction Wheel: practice like wandering yogi abandoning enemies/friends. Like deer in secluded mountains, cliffs, forests, peaks, snow valleys, empty valleys. Abandon three actions. Body: trade, agriculture, movement. Speech: all expressions. Mind: abandon contradictory thoughts. Practice supreme instruction one-pointedly. Body slow relaxes channels, channels relaxed makes wind-mind nature relax.
