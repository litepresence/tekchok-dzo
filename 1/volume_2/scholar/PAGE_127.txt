[STRUCTURE] This page presents the result-phase implications of exhaustion through teleological analysis [5477-5481], scriptural citation [5482-5498], and philosophical synthesis [5499-5515]. The structure moves from soteriological attainment (empowerment as regent) to cosmological transformation (elements dissolving), concluding with critical distinctions about emptiness interpretation.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5477-5478]: rgyun gyi ting nge 'dzin (continuum samadhi): unbroken meditative absorption. chos nyid kyi 'khor lo (dharmatā wheel/chakra): mandala of ultimate nature. spyan dang mngon shes chen po (eyes and great superknowledges): five eyes and six clairvoyances. khams gsum chos kyi rgyal po'i rgyal tshab (regent of dharma-king of three realms): attainment equivalence with Buddha.

Line [5482-5498]: Thal 'gyur citation on dissolution: 'byung ba dengs pa (elements dissolving), rdos pa 'gag (subtle body ceasing), rdul dang phra rab (atoms and particles), nyon mongs dengs pa (afflictions dissolving), bag la nyal (latency), kun nas ldang (arising).

Line [5499-5502]: stong pa'i chos nyid (emptiness dharmatā): rtsa rlung rags pa (channels winds coarse) exhaustion leading to sems dang sems byung (mind and mental factors) exhaustion. nang dbyings (inner expanse): dimension into which visions dissolve.

[CONTEXT] This passage marks the culmination of the four visions discussion, establishing the soteriological result of exhaustion-practice. The "regent of the dharma-king" (chos kyi rgyal po'i rgyal tshab) terminology reflects Mahāyāna political metaphors for buddhahood. The Thal 'gyur citation describes the somatic transformation—progressive dissolution of elements (earth-water-fire-air-space) followed by subtle body (rdos pa) cessation, culminating in wisdom-kāya. The critique of "snying tig pa" who deny form-kāya and wisdom in result-phase reflects internal Nyingma debates about the status of manifestation post-realization.

[CONCEPT]
• Attainment hierarchy:
  - Continuum samadhi in dharmatā chakra
  - Five eyes and six superknowledges mastery
  - Three realms dharma-king regent empowerment
  - All-base subtle obscurations severed

• Cosmic dissolution sequence:
  - Elements dissolve ('byung ba dengs pa)
  - Subtle body ceases (rdos pa 'gag)
  - Atoms and particles extinguished
  - Afflictions and latency dissolved
  - Five aggregates gradually refined
  - All becomes wisdom completion-kāya

• Critical distinctions:
  - Spontaneous completion requires form-kāya/wisdom
  - Uncompounded does not mean annihilation
  - Manifestation ground for sentient beings' welfare
  - Samantabhadra's compassion display requires basis
