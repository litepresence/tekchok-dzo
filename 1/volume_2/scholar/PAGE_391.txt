[16176-16218] [STRUCTURE] Page 391: Three Kayas and Mandala Architecture
**Analysis:** This page (lines 16176-16218) presents 
detailed exposition of the three kayas (*sku gsum*) and mandala architecture. 
The section delineates Sambhogakaya (*longs spyod rdzogs sku*) and Nirmanakaya 
(*sprul sku*) manifestations with their respective fields and retinues.

[16176-16189] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology
**Analysis:** Key terminology in this section includes:
- *sku gsum*: Primary technical term requiring philological precision
- *longs sku*: Particle usage (*kyis*, *las*) determines philosophical reading
- *sprul sku*: Contextual semantic field distinguishes Dzogchen usage
- *chos sku*: Classical Tibetan grammatical conventions apply

[16190-16204] [CONTEXT] Doctrinal Framework
**Analysis:** This section participates in Nyingma doxographical discourse,
delineating pure realm architecture (*zhing khams*) and Buddha-field cosmology. 
The presentation draws from *Guhyagarbha* and related tantric sources, 
synthesizing creation-phase (*bskyed rim*) and completion-phase (*rdzogs rim*) views.

[16204-16218] [CONCEPT] Philosophical Integration
**Analysis:** The conceptual framework advances understanding of:
1. Three kayas (*sku gsum*) as emanation architecture
2. Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*) enjoyment body and pure realms
3. Five family (*rigs lnga*) mandala organization
4. Natural luminosity (*rang 'od gsal*) as display basis
