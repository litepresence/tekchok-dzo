PAGE 268 ANALYSIS

[11619-11627] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page presents the THIRD category ('OD - light phenomena) following the established fourfold analytical framework. The structure follows: nature (ngo bo), cause (rgyu), divisions (dbye ba), and result ('bras bu). This section analyzes light manifestations at death indicating the deceased's level of realization. The progression from elemental essence (elements + awareness) to spontaneous manifestation represents the rdzogs chen emphasis on self-originated wisdom (rang byung ye shes).

[11619-11626] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Key terminology: ཁ་དོག་ལྔ་རང་གསལ་ (five colors self-illuminating) - the reflexive construction རང་ + verb indicates svayam-prabha (self-luminosity), a crucial concept in prajnaparamita and rdzogs chen. The term འབྱུང་བ་དངས་པ་ (clear/pure elements) contrasts with འབྱུང་བ་ངན་པ་ (impure elements) in medical texts. Particle analysis: ལས་འདས་ (transcended/abandoned) at 11621 marks the temporal transition. The phrase གཉིས་འཛོམ་པ་ (union of two) refers to the meeting of material and consciousness principles. Grammar: threefold division marked by contextual particles (skabs kyis).

[11627-11637] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The three types of light (upward-rising, radiating spokes, encircling aureole) correspond to bardo liberation stages. The "sky-hook" (gnam 'then) metaphor at 11625 references the rope/snake simile from the Lankavatara Sutra, indicating sudden recognition. The light-house ('od khyim) imagery connects to the Uttaratantra's "luminosity" (prabhasvara) concept. The timeframe specifications (five days, seven days) derive from the Abhidharmakosha's bardo duration calculations and Guhyasamaja tantra completion stage timing.

[11627-11637] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** Ontological analysis reveals light as the interface between material and immaterial dimensions. The upward-rising light (gyen 'greng) indicates immediate recognition of dharmakaya (ka dag), bypassing the bardo entirely - this represents the "instantaneous liberator" (cig car grol ba). The spoke-radiation (rtsibs shar) indicates completion of the sambhogakaya recognition process within the final bardo. The seven-day and five-day timeframes reflect the completion of purification cycles (sbyong ba) necessary for stabilizing realization in the respective Buddha bodies.

[11638-11655] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Scriptural citation section from the rDo rje Sems dpa'i Snying gi Me long, employing seven-syllable verse with end-line particle ཞེས་སོ་ marking closure. The citation parallels and confirms the prose exposition, creating a hermeneutical circle between root tantra and commentary. The structure shifts at 11656 to phenomenological description of spontaneous display (lhun grub snang ba).

[11638-11655] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** The root tantra citation employs technical terms: མུ་ཁྱུད་ (encircling aureole/periphery) - architectural term for circular structure, here applied to light halos. བར་དོ་དང་པོ་ (first bardo) vs. བར་དོ་མི་སྣང་བ་ (invisible bardo) - technical distinctions from the Karling Zhitro cycle. Particle གྱུར་ན་ (if it becomes) introduces conditional logic. The phrase སྐད་ཅིག་ལས་ནི་སངས་རྒྱས་ (instantaneously becomes Buddha) employs the emphatic ནི particle for definitive statement.

[11656-11660] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The description of "spontaneously present display emanating forth" (lhun grub snang...'phro ba) references the rdzogs chen doctrine of spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as distinct from original purity (ka dag). The two-fold emanation scheme (rang snang gzugs brnyan vs. gzhan snang rang mtshan) reflects the Yogacara distinction between imagined and dependent natures, adapted to rdzogs chen phenomenology. This passage connects to the Man ngag sde texts' discussion of the "eight displays" (snang ba brgyad).

[11656-11660] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The soteriological mechanics involve recognition (ngos 'dzin) of self-display (rang snang) versus fixation on external phenomena (gzhan snang). The "two emanations" (sprul pa gnyis) refer to: 1) tulku as self-appearances, and 2) tulku as benefitting others through external emanation. This dual structure parallels the co-emergent wisdom (lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes) doctrine - liberation requires recognizing both dimensions simultaneously. The "six realms of self-display" (rang snang 'gro drug) indicates all samsaric realms are projections of mind, not external locations.
