[STRUCTURE]
This page continues the citation-based exposition with verses from the *Klong drug pa* (Six Spaces), *Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long* (Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind), and *Yi ge med pa* (No Letters). The structure maintains the pattern of quotation followed by implicit commentary. The *Klong drug pa* verses present a systematic negation in paired *med* (non-existent) constructions: center-without-extremes, thought-without-objects, no deity yet mantra exists, no dharma yet transcends all imputations, no enemy yet no friend, no body yet no faculties appear. This culminates in the radical negation: "no buddha, no sentient being, no abiding, no emptiness" (*sangs rgyas med cing sems can med/gnas med stong pa nyid kyang med*). The *Kun tu bzang po* verses address error and obscuration (*gol sgrib*), asserting their non-existence in the dharmakāya.

[PHILOLOGY]
The construction *X med Y kyang med* (no X, also no Y) creates a symmetrical negation pattern. The term *mtha'* (extreme) in *mtha' med dbus su* (center without extremes) reflects the Madhyamaka *madhyama pratipad* (middle way) reinterpreted in Dzogchen's absolute sense. The compound *gol sgrib* (error and obscuration) represents the twin obstacles to recognition: *gol* (deviation/error) and *sgrib* (obscuration/veil). The particle *yang* (also/even) intensifies the negation: *gnas med stong pa nyid kyang med* (not even emptiness abides). The term *rnam smin* (ripening/karma) appears in *sdig pa'i rnam smin med* (no ripening of misdeeds), indicating the transcendence of karmic causality. The construction *...med pa las...* (from the non-existent...) indicates emanation without source.

[CONTEXT]
The *Klong drug pa* is another of the Seventeen Tantras, focusing on the "spatial" dimensions of awareness. The equation of "no buddha, no sentient being" (*sangs rgyas med cing sems can med*) echoes the *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa* and *Prajñāpāramitā* literature but is radicalized in Dzogchen's claim that these are not merely empty of inherent existence but spontaneously pure from the beginning. The *Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long* is an important *sems sde* tantra on primordial buddhahood. The reference to *byang chub snying po* (bodhicitta) as free from error and obscuration indicates that the "awakening mind" is not a cultivation but a recognition of innate purity. The phrase *nyon re mongs* (*nyon mongs*/affliction) suggests that holding error and obscuration as dual is itself the affliction.

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *chos med* (no dharma) transcends even the dharma of emptiness: this is not nihilism but the recognition that "dharmas" as reified entities do not exist, while the natural condition (*chos nyid*) spontaneously manifests. The negation of karma (*rnam smin*) and its ripening does not negate conventional causality but asserts that in the recognition of awareness, karmic traces are "self-liberated" (*rang grol*). The phrase *chos kyi sku ni sgrib dang bral ba la* (in the dharmakāya free from obscuration) establishes the intrinsic purity of the nature of mind. The concept of *skye med* (unborn) as *bsam dang bral ba'i rig pa* (awareness free from thought) distinguishes the "unborn" of Dzogchen from the *anutpāda* of Madhyamaka: not merely the absence of arising, but the positive presence of awareness beyond conceptual constructs. The "magical display" (*sgyu 'phrul*) formula - unborn yet all is born, born yet unborn - captures the paradoxical logic of *svābhāvika-kāya*: appearance and emptiness are inseparable.
