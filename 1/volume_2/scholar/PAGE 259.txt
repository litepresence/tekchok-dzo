[11233-11235] [CONCEPT] Certain Liberation Signs
**Analysis:** With certain outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags nges pa can*), liberation exists in such measure (*de ltar grol tshad du yod*). However, mere possession of signs does not pervade liberation (*rtags yod tsam la grol bas ma khyab*). The logic is: liberation pervades possession of signs (*grol ba la rtags yod pas khyab pa*), making this distinction precious (*gces*).

[11233-11235] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis: *Khyab pa*
**Analysis:** The term *khyab pa* (pervasion) denotes logical entailment in Tibetan epistemology (*tshad ma*). The instrumental *-s* in *yod pas* marks the pervasion relationship.

[11236-11249] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This citation warns against incomplete signs:
- Merely possessing some body/speech/mind signs (*lus ngag yid kyi rtags kun...'ga' tsam*)
- Does not mean liberation (*rnam par grol ba ma yin*)
- Worldly common siddhis (*'jig rten thun mong dngos grub*)
- Gradual hearers and self-buddhas (*rim gyis nyan thos rang sangs rgyas*)
- All enter this level (*sa la zhugs*)
- Without result of great purity (*rnam dag chen po'i 'bras bu med*)
- Only those with complete body/speech signs reach the great equality level (*mnyam pa chen po sa*)

[11236] [PHILOLOGY] Universal Quantifier: *Kun*
**Analysis:** *Kun* (all) with the genitive *ni* emphasizes that all three signs must be considered, not just one.

[11250-11251] [CONCEPT] Absence of Signs in Non-Meditators
**Analysis:** Those without outer/inner liberation signs now, who have gone into non-meditation (*bsgom med*), do not need meditation practice (*bsgom mi dgos*) as karma cannot harm them (*las kyis mi gnod*). However, future instructions must not be neglected (*phyis thod pa mgo la mi 'gel bya*).

[11252-11254] [CONCEPT] Warning Against False Claims
**Analysis:** Even if claiming "I see the authentic reality of dharmata, view and meditation are complete" (*ngas chos nyid rnal ma'i don mthong lta sgom mthar phyin*), if speaking falsely (*brdzun gtong*), this deceives both self and others, allowing demonic entry (*bdud zhugs pa*).

[11252] [PHILOLOGY] Rhetorical Particle: *Zer yang*
**Analysis:** *Zer yang* (even if saying) introduces a concessive clause, acknowledging the claim while refuting its validity.

[11255-11265] [CONTEXT] Citation on False Confidence
**Analysis:** This citation from *De nyid* warns:
- Without signs but claiming confidence in self-appearance (*rang snang gdeng du tshud*)
- Merely accepting intellectually (*yid dpyod rnams kyi lta ba*)
- Intellectually contrived meditation (*yid dpyod sgom pa*)
- Cannot liberate through this alone
- Will remain long in samsara

[11255] [PHILOLOGY] Negative Particle: *Mi ldan par*
**Analysis:** *Mi ldan par* (without possessing) establishes the prerequisite condition, negated in false practitioners.

[11266-11272] [CONCEPT] Special Instruction for Thodgal Practitioners
**Analysis:** For *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) meditation yogins, these signs certainly arise without deception (*grol nges bslu ba med par 'byung*). Therefore, special effort (*brtson 'grus khyad par can*) is instructed.

[11266] [PHILOLOGY] Emphatic Particle: *De'ang*
**Analysis:** *De'ang* (even that) introduces an additional consideration beyond the previous warning.

[11267-11272] [CONTEXT] Final Citation on Familiarization
**Analysis:** The citation from *De las* emphasizes:
- Familiarization with expanse and awareness (*dbyings rig goms pa*) is precious
- Whoever familiarizes with expanse and awareness
- The previously explained signs will certainly arise
- Practice with diligence (*nan tan bya*)

[11273] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Third General Meaning
**Analysis:** Line 11273 initiates the third general meaning (*spyi don gsum pa*): summarizing signs of liberation/confusion in bardo and future lives. This is structured in two parts (*gnyis te*).

[11273] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Particle: *La gnyis te*
**Analysis:** *La gnyis te* (regarding [this], two [divisions]) marks structural subdivision.
