[1072-1077] [CONCEPT] Eight Gates of Bardo Liberation
**Analysis:** When "seeing the completion of the eight gates of spontaneously accomplished intermediate state" (*bar do lhun grub kyi sgo brgyad rdzogs par mthong dus*), one is "liberated by knowing one's own face" (*rang ngo shes pas grol nas*). 

The process described in line 1075 is complex: the practitioner, from "the secret space of Sambhogakaya father-mother union" (*longs sku yab yum gyi sbyor ba'i mkha' gsang*), radiates light rays (*'od zer 'phros pa*) that enter "individually into the pure womb of father-mother at each station" (*gnas ris so sor pha ma las dag pa'i mngal du zhugs nas*), appearing to be born (*btsa' bar snang ba*), then teaching Dharma to show liberation.

This is compared (line 1076) to "opening emanations in a dream" (*rmi lam du sprul pa bkye ba*), emphasizing it is "summarized merely as self-appearance" (*rang snang 'ba' zhig gis bsdus pa*).

[1078-1079] [PHILOLOGY] Channels and Elements Nearing Purity
**Analysis:** "When the channels and elements are nearly pure" (*rtsa khams dag tu nye ba na*), even in this life the six realms appear inside the thigle (*thig le'i nang du 'gro drug snang ba yod*). These are "bound by the binding of the three inner crucial points" (*nang gi gnad gsum chings su bcings pas*), reaching the "ground of exhaustion" (*zad sa*), and therefore "not depending on distributing emanations" (*sprul pa 'gyed pa la mi ltos pa*).

This describes the advanced practitioner who has purified the subtle body to the point where the six realms are resolved within the thigle, transcending the need for the bardo emanation process.

[1080] [STRUCTURE] Authorial Interjection
**Analysis:** "This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power" (*dka' ba'i gnas 'di ni drang por brjod shes pa phyin chad byung na kho bo'i nus pa*). Longchenpa marks this as a particularly subtle point (*dka' ba'i gnas*), requiring prior understanding of "direct expression" (*drang por brjod*) to grasp. The first-person claim (*kho bo'i nus pa*) is unusual in the text, indicating the author's confidence in this specific teaching.

[1081-1084] [STRUCTURE] Emanation-Kaya of Performing Actions
**Analysis:** The second type of nirmanakaya is the "emanation-kaya of performing actions" (*bya ba byed pa'i sprul sku*), which operates hierarchically:
- To those abiding on the grounds (*sar gnas*): Sambhogakaya
- To the impure (*ma dag pa*): supreme emanation-kaya (*mchog gi sprul sku*)
- To the very impure (*shin tu ma dag pa*): emanating into suitable beings according to stations

This graduated presentation reflects the Mahayana doctrine of upaya-kaushalya (skillful means), adapting the teaching to the capacity of the recipient.

[1085-1100] [CONTEXT] Citation on Performing Actions
**Analysis:** From the tantra, characteristics of the emanation-kaya of performing actions:
1. "Showing to each whatever tames them" (*gang 'dul de la der ston*)
2. "Appearing suitable to others" (*gzhan dang mthun par snang ba*)
3. "Not deluded regarding others' benefit" (*gzhan gyi don la ma rmongs*)
4. "Able to transform into anything" (*cir yang bsgyur du btub*)
5. "Overwhelming beings" (*'gro ba zil gyis gnon*)—subduing through magnificence
6. "Afflictions naturally not existent, latencies appearing like the body" (*nyon mongs ngang gis med pa dang / bag chags lus ltar snang ba*)
7. "To beings arrived at the time, showing the great correct benefit" (*dus la bab pa'i sems can la / yang dag don chen ston par byed*)
8. "To whatever beings are tamed, appearing suitable to that" (*'gro ba gang dag 'dul ba la / de dang mthun par snang ba*)

[1101-1107] [CONTEXT] Four Correct Knowledges (*so so yang dag pa rig pa bzhi*)
**Analysis:** The emanation-kaya performs benefit through the four correct knowledges:
1. **Correct knowledge of languages** (*skad so so yang dag rig*): Teaching in each being's own language
2. **Correct knowledge of faculties and latencies** (*dbang po dang bag la nyal mkhyen*): Knowing capacities and propensities to teach suitably to thought
3. **Correct knowledge of vehicles** (*theg pa...mkhyen*): Teaching Great Vehicle, Small Vehicle, various vehicles, and Secret Mantra
4. **Correct knowledge of the two stages** (*bskyed rdzogs*): Generation and completion stages

This is the standard Buddhist enumeration of the Buddha's four *pratisamvids* (analytical knowledges), here applied specifically to nirmanakaya activity.
