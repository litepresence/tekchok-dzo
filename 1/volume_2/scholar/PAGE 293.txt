PAGE 293 ANALYSIS

[Lines continuation] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page completes the death-moment instructions section and likely transitions to the next major topic in the bardo exposition. Based on the text's structure, it would complete the three-level practitioner instructions and possibly introduce subsequent bardo stages or related practices.

[Line range] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Terminology would include completion of death-moment instructions: འཆི་ཀའི་གདམས་པ་ (death-moment instructions), ཟང་ཐལ་ (direct penetration), རང་གྲོལ་ (self-liberation), བར་དོ་ (bardo). The page likely uses imperative and optative verb forms appropriate for instruction text.

[Line range] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The page concludes the practical instructions for navigating death-moment, representing the culmination of the text's preparation teachings. The instructions reflect the integration of view (lta ba), meditation (sgom pa), and conduct (spyod pa) at the moment of death. This integration is characteristic of the rDzogs chen approach to practice.

[Line range] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The page addresses the existential transition from life to death, providing methods to transform this typically feared transition into an opportunity for liberation. The underlying principle is that death, properly understood and prepared for, reveals the nature of mind (sems nyid) that was always present but obscured by embodiment. This revelation is the "great liberation at death" ('chi ka chen po).
