PAGE 269 ANALYSIS

[11661-11673] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page completes the light phenomena section with scriptural citation and introduces the FOURTH category: SGRA (sound). The structural pattern continues with the fourfold analytical framework (nature, divisions, cause, result). The transition marker "དེ་ཉིད་ལས་" (from that very [text]) at 11661 connects the preceding exposition to its authoritative source. The progression from visual to auditory phenomena maintains sensory hierarchy (visual primary, auditory secondary) found in Abhidharma taxonomies.

[11661-11673] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** The root tantra citation (11662-11668) employs seven-syllable meter with feminine vocative མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ (dakini) marking tantric revelation context. Technical terms: སྐལ་ལྡན་སེམས་ཆེན་ (fortunate great beings) - the compound carries soteriological exclusivity. རང་བཞིན་དུ་ (in its own nature) employs the terminological marker for svabhava, though here indicating natural spontaneous activity rather than inherent existence. The structural divider "བཞི་པ་" (fourth) at 11669 introduces the sound category with abbreviated enumeration (only three of four components listed initially).

[11661-11673] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The continuation from rDo rje Sems dpa'i Snying gi Me long reinforces the text's reliance on major rdzogs chen tantras. The description of emanation activity "for the benefit of beings in the ten directions" connects to Mahayana bodhisattva vow literature (Dasabhumika Sutra, Bodhicaryavatara). The phrase "natural emanation" (rang bzhin sprul pa) references the three-nature (trisvabhava) doctrine reconceptualized in rdzogs chen terms - here indicating the natural expression of awareness rather than conditioned arising.

[11674-11685] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Sound analysis employs binary opposition structure: pleasant/continuous vs. fierce/short (དལ་ལ་རྒྱུན་རིང་བ་ vs. དྲག་ལ་ཡུན་ཐུང་བ་). The causal explanation distinguishes general causes (elemental friction) from specific causes (attainment of stabilization). The directional schema (East-Vajra, South-Ratna, West-Padma, North-Karma, Center-Tathagata) follows standard tantric mandala architecture. The result section establishes a causal chain: sound → enjoyment body → emanation body.

[11674-11685] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Key terminology: རྣ་བའི་དབང་པོ་ (auditory faculty) - standard Abhidharma term. འུར་བ་ (humming/roaring) and ཐུག་པ་ (piercing/staccato) are onomatopoeic terms indicating sound quality. The phrase གཉིས་འཐབས་པའི་རྐྱེན་ (condition of two striking/interacting) employs the technical term for causal condition (pratyaya). Directional markers use locative particles (du, ru, tu) with precision. The term བརྟན་པ་ཐོབ་པ་ (attaining stability) refers to the third of four stages of stabilization in completion stage practice.

[11674-11715] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The directional sound schema reflects the five-Buddha family (panca-tathagata) system central to Anuttarayoga tantras. The sound classification parallels similar taxonomies in Kalachakra (chapter 2) and Hevajra tantras, though adapted for post-mortem analysis. The seven-day and fourteen-day timeframes for attainment of complete Buddhahood derive from the Guhyasamaja system's enumeration of the number of days required for different types of practitioners to achieve complete realization after death.

[11686-11715] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** Epistemological analysis: sound serves as an auditory "proof" (rtags) of the deceased's realization level, analogous to visual light phenomena. The pleasant/fierce binary encodes ethical/aesthetic valuation (zhi ba = peaceful/virtuous; khro bo = wrathful/powerful). The causal mechanism - elemental interaction in space producing sound - mirrors the Samkhya theory of sound as the property of space/ether (akasha), here integrated into Buddhist elemental theory. The "stabilization attainment" (brtan pa thob pa) refers to the irreversible stage (avinivartaniya) where retrogression becomes impossible.
