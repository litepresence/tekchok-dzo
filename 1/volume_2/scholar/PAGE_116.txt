[STRUCTURE] This page initiates analysis of the "transcend knowing experience" ('das pa'i shes nyams), a technical term indicating meditative experiences beyond conceptual cognition. The passage establishes a threefold typology: (1) knowing pleasure happiness experience (shes pa dga' bde'i nyams), (2) end change experience (mthar 'gyur gyi nyams), and (3) vision experience (snang ba'i nyams). Structural markers include "first is" (dang po ni) introducing the initial category, followed by "fabricated meditation" (bcos ma'i bsgoms pa) as dialectical counterpoint, concluding with comparative analysis using "difference" (khyad) terminology.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5080]: 'das pa (past participle of 'da' ba, to transcend/pass beyond) + shes (knowing) + nyams (experience) = "transcend knowing experience," indicating supra-cognitive meditative states. stong gsal mtha' bral (empty clear extreme separate): classic Dzogchen triad describing realization beyond extremes. rtogs tshad (realization measure): technical term for diagnostic criteria of authentic recognition.

Line [5086-5087]: gnad du gcun pa (bound at the main point): technical physical yoga term for body/speech binding techniques. bag la zha nas (from latency relaxing): bag la nyal (latency) + zha ba (to relax), describing the settling of wind-mind (rlung sems).

Line [5088]: bag yangs (spacious/open): term for non-dual spaciousness. gzung 'dzin (grasping and holding): shorthand for subject-object duality. khrol chags su skyes (arisen as spread-desire): technical term for bliss-expansion in Dzogchen physiology.

Line [5089]: bcos ma (fabricated/artificial): key dialectical term contrasting with rang bzhin (natural). 'khrab pa (throbbing): coarse somatic experience indicating non-authentic meditation.

[CONTEXT] This passage operates within Result Vehicle (Dzogchen) framework, specifically the Tögal (thod rgal) visionary path. The three experiences correspond to classical Dzogchen taxonomy from tantras such as the Kun byed rgyal po and commentarial traditions of the Vima snying thig and Mkha' 'gro snying thig. The "eight" (brgyad) mentioned line [5100] refers to the eight major visionary signs (sna tshogs snang ba) preceding full awakening, distinct from the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) schema. The distinction between bcos ma (fabricated) and rang bzhin (natural) meditation reflects the Nyingma critique of contrived practice versus spontaneous self-liberation (rang grol).

[CONCEPT]
• Three experiences typology:
  - Knowing bliss experience: non-dual spaciousness (bag yangs), natural samadhi (rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan)
  - End-change experience: visionary instability, wind-based phenomena (rlung g.yo ba), eight signs
  - Vision experience: awareness self-resonance (rig pa'i rang gdangs), spontaneous completion (lhun grub)

• Key dialectical distinctions:
  - Fabricated vs. natural meditation (bcos ma vs. rang bzhin)
  - Coarse throb vs. subtle bliss ('khrab pa vs. khrol chags)
  - Grasping vs. non-grasping (zhen 'dzin vs. zhen med)

• Physiological correlations:
  - Body/speech binding (lus ngag gnad du gcun pa) → wind-mind settling
  - Inner samadhi (nang ting nge 'dzin) → luminous-emptiness pervasion
  - Self-resonance dissolution (rang gdangs thim pa) → pure spontaneous domain
