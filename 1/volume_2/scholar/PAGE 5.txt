[226] [CONTEXT] Source Text: Sgra Thalgyur
**Analysis:** *Sgra thal 'gyur* (Sound Penetration) is a Dzogchen tantra focusing on the liberative power of sound (*sgra*). The text teaches that by training (*bslabs pa*) in the "sound-meaning" (*sgra don*) of elements, one obtains common attainments (*thun mong gi dngos grub*).

[227-232] [CONCEPT] Five Sound-Meanings and Powers
**Analysis:** The verse presents five specific trainings and their results:
1. **Forms** (*gzugs*) → Body exhaustion/transmutation (*lus zad*)
2. **Sound** (*sgra*) → Knowledge of languages (*skad rnams shes*)
3. **Smell** (*dri*) → Accomplishment of extracting essence (*bcud kyis len*)
4. **Taste** (*ro*) → Entity becomes nectar (*bdud rtsi*)

Note: The fifth (touch) is implicit or omitted in this citation.

[229] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Lus zad*
**Analysis:** *Lus zad* (body exhaustion/dissolution) refers to the tantric attainment where the coarse physical body is transmuted into a subtle body of light—a common goal in completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices.

[234] [CONTEXT] Source Text: Secret Conduct Seed Tantra
**Analysis:** *Gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* (Secret Conduct Seed Tantra) is a major *Atiyoga* text. "Seed" (*sa bon*) indicates the potentiality aspect of practice.

[235-238] [CONCEPT] Four Elements and Clairvoyance
**Analysis:** By becoming familiar (*goms pa*) with sounds/meanings of the four elements (earth, water, fire, wind), one accomplishes:
- Knowledge of the self-sounds (*rang skad*) of the six races (*rigs drug*)
- Arising of clairvoyance (*mngon shes*)

The "six races" refers to the six classes of beings in Buddhist cosmology: gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings.

[240] [STRUCTURE] Concluding Outer Arising Section
**Analysis:** This line concludes the presentation of outer elements (*phyi'i 'byung ba*), summarizing them as the support (*rten*) and abode (*gnas*) of all sentient beings.

[241] [STRUCTURE] # Tenth Category: Manner of Completeness
**Analysis:** The tenth of ten categories (*bcu pa*) addresses how samsara-nirvana Dharmas are complete (*tshang tshul*) in the yogi's body-mind. This is threefold:
1. Generally showing partial-similarity completeness
2. Explaining in particular completeness in body-mind
3. Making understood through great definite symbols

[246-258] [CONCEPT] The Body-Mind as Path
**Analysis:** This dense passage presents homologies between embryological development and the spiritual path:

**Body Components** | **Path Correspondences**
---|---
Father-mother | Method-wisdom (*thabs shes rab*)
Projecting karma-wind | Dharmakaya awakening
Five elements seeds | Five families' sound-potential
Two equipoise essences | Two accumulations, method-wisdom union
Womb abiding | Abiding in base-dimension
7 sets of 7 days (49 days) | Seven paths of seven pure elements
10 months in womb | Completion of ten grounds (*sa bcu*)
Birth | Emanation body (*sprul sku*)
Body abiding, field engagement | Enjoyment body (*longs sku*)
Death | Dharmakaya empty nature

This is the doctrine of "complete in oneself" (*rang la tshang*), where the body-mind already contains all aspects of the path and result.

[247] [PHILOLOGY] Particle: *Char*
**Analysis:** *Char* (portion/aspect) is used repeatedly to establish correspondences. Literally meaning "fall" or "portion," it indicates that each physiological component "falls into" or corresponds with a spiritual category.

[252] [CONTEXT] Technical Term: *Khams bdun*
**Analysis:** *Khams bdun* (seven elements/pure components) refers to the seven constituents of the body in ayurvedic medicine: chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and regenerative fluids. Here they are correlated with seven stages of path completion.

[259-264] [CONTEXT] Pearl Garland Citation on Effortless Liberation
**Analysis:** The Mutik Trengwa citation establishes the Dzogchen view that liberation is not achieved through effort (*'bad pas*) but recognized as already accomplished primordially (*ye nyid nas*). The union of method (*thabs*) and wisdom (*shes rab*)—symbolized by father and mother—is the natural cause of this recognition.

[261-262] [CONCEPT] Effort vs. Primordial Liberation
**Analysis:** This encapsulates the Dzogchen distinction between:
- **Path of effort** (*'bad pa'i lam*): gradual, causal vehicles
- **Path of primordial liberation** (*ye grol*): Dzogchen, recognition of already-accomplished state

[263-264] [CONCEPT] Method-Wisdom Union
**Analysis:** Father (*pha*) = method (*thabs*), mother (*ma*) = wisdom (*shes rab*). Their union generates the recognition of primordial liberation—an important doctrine in both *Atiyoga* and *Anuyoga* tantras.
