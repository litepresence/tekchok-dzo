[4566-4591] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Posture Applications
**Analysis:** The section transitions from posture theory to application through the soteriological principle that three poisons manifest as three bodies. This represents a *sa bcad* (topical subdivision) on correlating constitutional types with appropriate postures. The structure follows:
1. Thesis (4566-4567): Three afflictions bind to three realms, liberated through three postures
2. Analysis by poison type (4568-4590): Desire (*'dod chags*), ignorance (*gti mug*), aversion (*zhe sdang*)
3. Conclusion (4591): Three postures are determinate (*nges*)

The text uses rebirth typology—bird (*bya*), pig (*phag*), snake (*sbrul*)—from the *srid pa'i 'khor lo* (wheel of existence) tradition.

[4568-4582] [PHILOLOGY] Causal Particles and Rebirth Typology
**Analysis:** The ablative *las* in *ma dag pa las* (from unpurified [state]) at 4569, 4578, and 4585 marks the causal origin of rebirth forms. The particle *ni* serves a topicalizing function, introducing each rebirth type. The term *smos pa* (ripened/manifested) appears in all three analyses, indicating the *smin pa* (ripening) process by which karmic predispositions (*bag la nyal*) manifest as specific embodied forms. The construction *'o na* (then/therefore) at 4583 functions as a logical connector between analysis and prescription.

[4568-4591] [CONTEXT] Karma and Constitutional Psychology
**Analysis:** The text integrates three systems:
1. **Karmic causality**: Three poisons (*dug gsum*) produce three rebirth destinies
2. **Constitutional psychology**: Each rebirth type exhibits specific somatic and psychological characteristics
3. **Somatic remediation**: Each type harmonizes with specific postures

The bird-type (desire-dominated) manifests speech-predominant characteristics (*ngag gtsod che*), harmonizing with Sambhogakaya posture. The pig-type (ignorance-dominated) exhibits mind-predominant characteristics (*yid gtsod che*), including conceptual proliferation (*rnam rtog che*) and sleep-affinity (*gnid la dga'*), harmonizing with Dharmakaya posture. The snake-type (aversion-dominated) shows body-predominant characteristics (*lus kyi byed pa gtsod che*), harmonizing with Nirmanakaya posture.

[4591-4596] [CONCEPT] Liberation Mechanisms
**Analysis:** The section establishes two liberation principles:
1. **Path-obstacle clearing** (*'khor las grol*): The three postures liberate from the binding of body, speech, and mind (4591-4594)
2. **Numerical sufficiency** (*gsum kho nar nges*): Exactly three postures are required—more is unnecessary (*mang na mi dgos*), fewer is incomplete (*nyung na ma tshang*)

The transition at 4595-4596 marks a shift to the *ngag gi gnad* (speech pith) section, using the term *smra ba bcad pa* (cutting speech) as the pivot. This follows the triadic structure: body postures established, now speech training, with mind to follow.
