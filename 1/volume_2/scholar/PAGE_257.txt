[11125-11135] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence) Tantra
**Analysis:** This section cites the *Thal 'gyur* tantra, presenting the marks (*rtags*) and measures (*tshad*) of meditative practice. The verse enumerates six external signs:
1. *Lus ni yang zhing zang thal snang* - body appearing light and transparent
2. *Sa la reg med thogs med* - without touching earth, without obstruction
3. *Ngag gi nus rdzogs gtam zungs zad* - speech power complete, eloquence exhausted (beyond words)
4. *Sems ni 'pho bar nus pa* - mind able to transfer [consciousness]
5. *Mig dang rnam pa sna dang lce* - eye, form, nose, tongue
6. *Lus kyi dbang po kun zad* - all body senses ceased
7. *Rang bzhin med par gyur pa tshad* - measure of becoming without nature

[11125-11127] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Signs and Measures
**Analysis:** Following the presentation of rigpa's essence, divisions, and characteristics, Longchenpa now addresses the signs (*rtags*) and measures (*tshad*) of meditative accomplishment.

[11128-11135] [PHILOLOGY] Parallel Structure Analysis
**Analysis:** The verse employs *dang* conjunction to link the six signs. The genitive particles (*gi, kyi*) mark possession and agency throughout.

[11136-11139] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Analysis of Signs
**Analysis:** Line 11136 introduces the third major section (*gsum pa*) analyzing signs through three divisions:
1. *Skye med thob pa'i rtags spyir bstan* - general presentation of unborn attainment signs
2. *Yon tan gyi rtags bye brag tu bshad* - specific explanation of qualities' signs
3. *Rtags gsum 'dres pa'i khyad par so sor brjod pa* - distinct articulation of three-sign combination

[11140-11143] [CONCEPT] Signs of Unborn Attainment
**Analysis:** The yogin established in confidence (*gdeng du tshud pa*) in the realization of primordial purity (*ka dag gi rtogs pa*) exhibits two signs of not taking rebirth in samsara:
1. *Lus la srog chags med pa* - no living creatures on the body
2. *Skra dang sen mo mi skye ba* - hair and nails not growing

[11143-11161] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** The citation describes the three-month (*zla ba gsum*) process at death:
- Visible to others in the expanse of five lights (*'od lnga'i dkyil*)
- Arising as the five-family form (*rigs lnga'i sku*) in space
- Rising and dissolving (*'phags te yal ba*) into the sky

[11143] [PHILOLOGY] Temporal Particle: *De nas*
**Analysis:** *De nas* (from that/then) establishes temporal sequence following the two preliminary signs.

[11148-11161] [CONCEPT] The Dissolution Process
**Analysis:** The verse presents the complete liberation process:
- Line 11148: Possessing these marks indicates sharing the same fortune (*skal pa mnyam pa*) as the teacher
- Lines 11150-11151: Cessation of birth continuum (*skye ba'i rgyun chad*), absence of insects on body
- Lines 11152-11153: Hair and nails not growing, continuum ended
- Lines 11156-11160: After three months, elements dissolve (*'byung ba rang sar dengs*), contaminated aggregates (*zag bcas phung po*) become invisible, one's body with families rises into light's expanse

[11162] [PHILOLOGY] Superlative Designation: *Skal chen*
**Analysis:** *Skal chen* (great fortune) designates the yogin of dissolution time (*zad pa'i dus*) with exceptional capacity.

[11163-11167] [STRUCTURE] Second Division: Praise of Qualities
**Analysis:** Line 11163 initiates the second division praising qualities (*yon tan*), distinguishing:
- *Snang ba lus ngag gi yon tan* - qualities of apparent body and speech
- *Med pa rig pa stong pa'i yon tan* - qualities of empty awareness's unapparent [aspect]

[11166-11167] [CONCEPT] Enjoyment of Pure Realms
**Analysis:** The measureless qualities involve enjoying peaceful and wrathful mandalas (*zhi khro gnyis kyi dkyil 'khor*) in the self-appearing buddha-field (*rang snang sangs rgyas kyi zhing*), along with dharmakaya qualities.

[11163] [PHILOLOGY] Demonstrative Particle: *De'i*
**Analysis:** *De'i* (of that) refers back to the yogin established in the signs, linking the qualities section to the previous discussion.
