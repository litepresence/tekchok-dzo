[CONTEXT] This passage synthesizes the four visions as stages of path-arising (lam skye ba'i rim pa)—a Dzogchen reconceptualization of the bodhisattva path. The Gsang ba snying po citation grounds the presentation in canonical tantra. The stairway metaphor captures Dzogchen's unique position: stages exist as descriptive categories yet are simultaneously transcended in instantaneous recognition. The comparison with "common vehicles" (theg pa thun mong ba) establishes Dzogchen's superiority while acknowledging shared soteriological goals. The emphasis on diligent practice (brtson pas nyams su len pa) despite the rhetoric of spontaneity reflects Longchenpa's balanced presentation.

[CONCEPT]
• Four visions as path stages:
  - Dharmatā vision: initial recognition
  - Increasing experience: maturation
  - Awareness at measure: completion
  - Exhaustion: liberation into ground

• Stairway metaphor:
  - Stages like steps on ladder
  - Each stage supports the next
  - Yet all are single continuum
  - Path-arising without separate attainment

• Superiority to common vehicles:
  - Four visions as Dzogchen bhūmis
  - Exhaustion of outflows (zag bcas)
  - Buddha-appearance in this life
  - Result-vehicle distinction
