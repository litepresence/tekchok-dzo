[STRUCTURE] This page presents the sixteenth topic—three recognitions (ngos shes gsum)—through enumeration markers [5851-5865], detailed exposition [5866-5880], and concluding synthesis [5881-5895]. The structure employs tripartite division of recognition types and their respective functions in the path.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5851-5865]: ngo shes (recognition): technical term for correct identification of meditative experiences. yid ches (confidence): epistemic certainty. lam 'di'i gnad (this path's crucial point): essential instruction.

Line [5866-5880]: snang ba'i ngo shes (vision recognition): identifying visionary phenomena correctly. rig pa'i ngo shes (awareness recognition): recognizing awareness-nature. blo yi ngo shes (mind recognition): cognitive certainty. zad pa'i ngo shes (exhaustion recognition): understanding exhaustion-phase. gnas skabs (occasion): temporary state. mthar thug (final limit): ultimate destination.

Line [5881-5895]: de dag nyams su len (practice those): application phase. phyir mi ldog pa'i nges pa (non-return certainty): irreversible attainment. 'khrul rtog (delusion-thought): erroneous cognition to be abandoned.

[CONTEXT] This passage establishes recognition (ngo shes) as the cognitive foundation of Dzogchen practice. Unlike gradual paths that emphasize transformation, Dzogchen emphasizes recognition of what is already present. The four recognitions provide diagnostic tools for navigating the four visions: recognizing visions as self-display, recognizing awareness as the ground, recognizing mind's constructs, and recognizing exhaustion as perfection. The emphasis on "this life's body" (tshe 'di'i lus) reflects Nyingma assertions about attainability of full awakening without awaiting future lives.

[CONCEPT]
• Four recognitions (ngo shes bzhi):
  - Vision recognition: identifying visionary marks
  - Awareness recognition: knowing the knower
  - Mind recognition: distinguishing conceptual from non-conceptual
  - Exhaustion recognition: understanding dissolution

• Recognition functions:
  - Diagnostic: identifying path stages
  - Prognostic: predicting attainment
  - Therapeutic: correcting errors
  - Teleological: orienting toward goal

• Practice requirements:
  - Put into practice (nyams su len)
  - Non-return certainty
  - Abandon delusion-thought
  - Final limit as destination
