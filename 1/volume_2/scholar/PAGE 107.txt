[4749-4767] [STRUCTURE] Sky-Gazing and Scriptural Citations
**Analysis:** The section develops the field-pith through the sky-gazing technique (*nam mkha'i lta ba*). The structure:
1. Technical description (4749-4752): Empty awareness placed on empty sky produces compatible experience
2. Scriptural citations (4752-4763):
   - *Sems sde* (Mind Section): Yogin abides in sky's bird-path
   - *Sdud pa* (Collection): Investigate meaning in sky
   - *Yum bar ma* (Middle Mother): Prajnaparamita meditation is sky-yoga
3. Terminological analysis (4761-4763): Various names for this view

The transition at 4768 introduces the third pith: wind-awareness (*rlung rig gi gnad*).

[4749-4767] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Particle Usage and Vision Terminology
**Analysis:** The comparative particle *dang mthun pa* (compatible with) at 4750 establishes the relationship between sky (*nam mkha'*) and experience (*nyams*). The term *mthun* appears frequently in this section, indicating correspondence rather than identity. The ablative *las* in *sems sde las* (4752) and other citations marks textual source. The term *snang ba* (vision/appearance) appears with multiple qualifiers: *dbyings snang* (dhatu-vision), *ye shes snang* (wisdom-vision), *nyams snang* (experiential vision)—distinguishing ontological levels of appearance. The phrase *ris med* (limitless/boundaryless) at 4761 indicates the non-discriminating nature of this view.

[4749-4788] [CONTEXT] Multiple View Classifications
**Analysis:** The text presents three equivalent formulations:
1. *Mnyam pa ris med kyi lta ba* (equal limitless view): Outer and inner fields mixed
2. *Dbyings rig gnyis med kyi lta ba* (dhatu-awareness non-dual view)
3. *'Khor 'das ro mnyam gyi lta ba* (samsara-nirvana taste-equal view)

These correspond to three levels of realization:
- Cosmological (*mnyam pa*): Equality of all phenomena
- Epistemological (*gnyis med*): Non-duality of knowing and field
- Soteriological (*ro mnyam*): Equal taste of cyclic and liberated states

The citation from *Bstan bu* (Instruction-Child) at 4764-4767 provides the lineage transmission (*brgyud pa*) authority.

[4768-4788] [CONCEPT] Wind-Awareness Pith: Mechanics and Functions
**Analysis:** The third pith (*rlung rig gi gnad*) operates through slowness (*dal ba*):
1. **External function** (4772): Life-extending helper (*tshe rgyas pa'i grogs*)
2. **Internal function** (4773): Cessation of conceptuality (*rnam par rtog pa nub pa*)
3. **Secret function** (4774): Direct seeing of awareness (*rig pa mngon sum du mthong ba*)
4. **Actual function** (4775): Buddha-making, contaminated non-seeing

The technical term *dal ba* (slow/easy) indicates both temporal slowness and "ease" or non-effort. The text at 4770 specifies the technique: wind shoots far outward (*phyir rgyang ring po 'phren*), held outward (*phyir bzung*), placed (*gzhag*)—creating a "pregnant pause" that interrupts ordinary breathing patterns.

The threefold repetition of the *Thal 'gyur* verse (4776-4788) emphasizes the severing of body-mind connection (*lus sems kyi 'brel chad*) as the central mechanism.
