[11437-11439] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Analysis of Relics
**Analysis:** The relics (*gdung*) section comprises three divisions:
1. *Thun mong gi dbye bas mdor bstan* - brief presentation through common divisions
2. *Khyad par gyi dbye bas rgyas par bshad* - extensive explanation through distinctive divisions
3. *Gdung dang ring bsrel gyi khyad par gyis don bsdus* - meaning summary through relic-ring distinction

[11440-11457] [CONCEPT] Common Divisions of Relics
**Analysis:** All beings are buddhas from the beginning (*ye nas sangs rgyas*), dwelling as five buddha-families (*rig lnga*), both individual and non-individual. The unripened five relics (*gdung lnga*) in the life-force (*srog*) are ripened through yogin's luminosity-essence path practice, manifesting as five *shariram* (relics), liberating in respective families.

[11444-11456] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** The verse citation enumerates five relics by family:
- *Sha ri ram* - Tathagata family (white)
- *Ba ri ram* - Vajra family (dark blue)
- *Chu ri ram* - Ratna family (yellow)
- *Bse ri ram* - Padma family (red)
- *Nya ri ram* - Karma family (green)

[11457-11467] [CONCEPT] Relic Signs of Liberation
**Analysis:** Whatever family-relics arise on the person indicate liberation in that family's buddha. The citation from *De nyid* confirms:
- Signs arise on the capable person's body at death
- Individual family relics lead to seeing respective buddha-bodies in bardo

[11468-11475] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long*
**Analysis:** Relics also divide into five by color, indicating liberation in respective pure realms:
- Dark blue (*mthing ga*) - Vairocana's realm, manifest complete awakening
- White (*dkar po*) - Vajrasattva
- Yellow (*ser po*) - Ratnasambhava
- Red (*dmar po*) - Amitabha
- Green (*ljang gu*) - Amoghasiddhi
- Multicolored (*sna tshogs*) - attainment of five kayas spontaneously accomplished ground

[11476-11479] [STRUCTURE] Distinctive Divisions Structure
**Analysis:** The distinctive divisions (*khyad par gyi dbye ba*) analyze four aspects:
1. Color size measure (*kha dog che chung gi tshad*)
2. Location distinction (*gnas kyi khyad par*)
3. Cause of arising (*rgyu gang las byung ba*)
4. (Fourth implicit)

[11480-11482] [CONCEPT] Five Colors, Two Body Types
**Analysis:** Five colors contain five families. These divide into:
- Peaceful relic colors
- Wrathful relic colors

[11483-11488] [CONCEPT] Peaceful Relic Colors
**Analysis:** From *Sku gdung 'bar ba*:
- *Sha ri ram* - white (*dkar po*)
- *Ba ri ram* - dark blue (*sngo nag*)
- *Chu ri ram* - yellow (*ser po*)
- *Bse ri ram* - red (*dmar po*)
- *Nya ri ram* - green (*ljang gu*)

[11489-11498] [CONTEXT] Citation from *Rang shar* on Wrathful Relic Colors
**Analysis:** Wrathful relic colors differ:
- *Sha ri ram* - white with radiance (*dkar la gdangs*)
- *Chu ri ram* - dark blue
- *Ba ri ram* - yellowish-red with spots (*tshig ser ldan*)
- *Nya ri ram* - smoky black (*smug nag*)
- *Pancaram* - red-green-black (*dmar ljang nag*)

[11499-11505] [CONCEPT] Size and Location Specifications
**Analysis:** Size measures:
- *Sha ri ram*: size of white mustard seed (*mon sran gyi 'bru*)
- Others: size of sesame seed to small mustard seed
- Oily and round

Locations:
- *Sha ri ram*: head (*mgo*)
- *Ba ri ram*: between ribs (*rtsib ma'i go bar*)
- *Chu ri ram*: above liver (*mchin pa'i steng*)
- *Bse ri ram*: kidneys (*mkhal ma*)
- *Nya ri ram*: above heart/lobe (*glo ba'i steng*)

[11440] [PHILOLOGY] Universal Particle: *Spyir*
**Analysis:** *Spyir* (generally/in common) establishes the general principle before specific divisions.
