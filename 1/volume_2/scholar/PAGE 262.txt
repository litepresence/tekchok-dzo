[11380-11381] [CONCEPT] Liberation Through Both Body Types
**Analysis:** When both peaceful and wrathful bodies arise (*zhi khro gnyis ka byung*):
- Consciousness dissolves into space (*rnam shes nam mkhar thim*)
- Space's primordially pure self-radiance dawns (*nam mkha' ka dag gi rang gdangs shar*)
- Liberation without dharmata bardo (*chos nyid kyi bar do med par sangs rgyas*)
- Included within this-life liberation category (*tshe 'dir grol ba'i khongs su 'dus*)

[11382-11383] [CONCEPT] Future Separation
**Analysis:** The separation from this basis (*rten 'di nas 'bral ba*) in future (*phyi ma*) follows this same pattern (*de yin pa'i phyir*).

[11384-11386] [CONCEPT] Peaceful Body Liberation Timeline
**Analysis:** When peaceful body arises:
- This appearance ceases (*snang ba 'di 'gags*)
- Liberation in five absorption days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag lnga*) of self-luminous self-appearance
- *Bsam gtan gyi zhag* defined as absorption duration (*ting nge 'dzin gyi gnas cha*)
- Duration varies (*ring thung gi khyad*) among yogins

[11387-11388] [CONCEPT] Wrathful Body Liberation Timeline
**Analysis:** When wrathful body arises:
- From eye emerges Vajrasattva nose-cord (*mig nas rdo rje sems dpa'i sna thag*)
- Sound-light-ray three self-appear (*sgra 'od zer gsum rang snang*)
- Liberation in five instants (*skad cig cha lnga*)

[11389-11405] [CONTEXT] Citations on Dual Liberation
**Analysis:** 
1. *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (lines 11390-11400): If both arise, without bardo, confident in great primordially pure essence; five days for true seeing; buddhahood dissolution; wrathful body liberates in bardo in five instants
2. *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (lines 11401-11405): Peaceful body yields stability after appearance ceases, cannot emit Nirmanakaya; wrathful body gains stability, can emit Nirmanakaya after twenty-one days

[11406-11410] [CONCEPT] Distinction in Emanation Capacity
**Analysis:** The peaceful body:
- Dissolves into transparent primordial purity (*zang thal du ka dag sa*)
- No bardo emanation arises (*bar do nas rang snang gi sprul pa mi 'byung*)
- Pure appearance basis (*ka dag...sprul pa'i snang cha*) absent
- Becomes basis for other-appearance Sambhogakaya-Nirmanakaya
- No self-emanation capacity, but other-benefit activities (*'phrin las*) arise dependent on that

[11411-11421] [CONCEPT] Wrathful Body Emanation Process
**Analysis:** The wrathful body:
- Liberates through recognizing sound-light-ray as self-appearance (*sgra 'od zer gsum rang snang du shes pas*)
- Spontaneous presence base-appearance dawns (*lhun grub kyi gzhi snang shar*)
- Pauses for a moment (*dar cig sdod pas*)
- After twenty-one absorption days completed
- From impure self-appearance (six realms), through pure gate, emanates Nirmanakaya for whoever needs taming
- Functions like illusion benefiting illusion (*sgyu mas sgyu ma'i don byed pa*)
- Self-appearance benefits self-appearance (*rang snang la rang snang gis don byed*)

[11417-11419] [CONCEPT] Necessity of Prior Liberation
**Analysis:** After emitting emanation, prior liberation is already accomplished. Without self-liberation, self-benefit incomplete, other-benefit circumstances cannot arise.

[11420-11421] [PHILOLOGY] Comparative Particles: *Tsam dang...de bas*
**Analysis:** The comparison *skar mda' rgyug pa tsam* (like shooting star) establishes the brief, swift nature of emanation duration.

[11422-11425] [CONCEPT] Error Regarding Emanation Capacity
**Analysis:** Common confusion (*'khrul pa*) regarding ability to emit emanation leads to focusing attention (*blo rtse gtod*) on whether buddhas can benefit others. This is called a "great fierce error" (*rnor ba rngams che*).

[11424-11425] [CONTEXT] Mahayana View on Buddha Activity
**Analysis:** Buddhas not engaging in benefit is neither desired nor possible in Mahayana.
