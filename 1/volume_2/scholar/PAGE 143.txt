[STRUCTURE]
This page continues the enumerative catalog of Dzogchen "greatness" (*chen po*) qualities, extending the previous page's list format. The structure now shifts to gerundive verb forms (*mi...*) indicating impossibility or non-occurrence: *mi g.yo* (not moving), *mi 'gul* (not shifting), *mi gnas* (not abiding), *mi len* (not taking), *mi 'gro* (not going), *mi 'ong* (not coming), *mi bsam* (not thinking), *mi rtog* (not conceptualizing), *mi dmigs* (not apprehending), *mi mnyam* (not equalizing), *mi 'gyur* (not changing). This is followed by temporal triads (*snga*/before, *da lta*/now, *mtha'*/end) applied to confusion (*'khrul pa*), liberation (*grol ba*), and the three times (*'das pa*, *gnas pa*, *ma 'ongs pa*). The structure then shifts to nominal compounds with *-med* suffixes (*ris med*, *gnas lugs kyi gzhi med*, *yin lugs kyi lam med*, etc.), concluding with the key term *ye sangs* (primordially awake).

[PHILOLOGY]
The construction *mi + verb* creates a systematic negation of all cognitive and physical activities. The temporal triad *snga/da lta/mtha'* (before/now/end) is a standard Buddhist temporal framework applied here to demonstrate the impossibility of confusion and liberation in any timeframe. The compound *'khrul pa* (confusion) is etymologically linked to *'khrul* (to err/wander), while *grol ba* (liberation) derives from *grol* (to release). The particle *las* appears in *bya rtsol las 'das pa* (transcending objects and effort). The term *gnas lugs* (natural condition) combines *gnas* (to abide/remain) with *lugs* (manner/system). The compound *yin lugs* (mode of being) parallels it. The term *ye sangs* (primordially awake) combines *ye* (primordial) with *sangs* (awake), distinct from *sangs rgyas* (buddha) which implies awakening through cultivation.

[CONTEXT]
The temporal analysis reflects Madhyamaka critique of temporal existence applied to Dzogchen's unique emphasis on primordial liberation. The negation of the three times (*dus gsum*) appears in the *Rig pa rang shar* and other Nyingma *sems sde* texts. The absence of ground (*gzhi med*), path (*lam med*), and result (*'bras bu med*) distinguishes Dzogchen from all lower vehicles, particularly the Path Vehicle (*lam gyi theg pa*) of sutras and the Result Vehicle (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) of tantras. The term *lta sgom* (view and meditation) represents the core practice of sutra and lower tantra vehicles, which Dzogchen claims to transcend. The phrase *phyogs ris kyi chos med* (no dharma of partiality/direction) critiques sectarian divisions (*phyogs ris*), reflecting Nygma universalism.

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *ye sangs* (primordially awake) versus *rgyal sangs* (awakened through victory/conquest) is crucial: buddhahood is not an achievement but a recognition of primordial state. The "three non-existences" (*med gsum*) - ground, path, and result - constitute the Dzogchen critique of teleological spirituality. The temporal analysis demonstrates the "threefold non-existence of confusion" (*'khrul pa med pa gsum*): confusion has never been experienced (*ma myong*), does not presently abide (*mi gnas*), and cannot possibly exist in the future (*mi srid*). This parallels the threefold purity (*dag pa gsum*) of the *prajnaparamita* literature but reinterprets it ontologically rather than merely epistemologically. The phrase *gnas lugs kyi gzhi med* (no ground of natural condition) indicates that even the "ground" (*gzhi*) of Dzogchen is not a substantial foundation but a mere pointer to the ungrounded nature of awareness. The "great nameless" (*ming med chen po*) of samsara-nirvana indicates the collapse of the fundamental Buddhist dichotomy, a hallmark of Atiyoga.
