[STRUCTURE] This page presents detailed definitional analysis of dharmatā exhaustion through fivefold schema [5432-5457]: essence (ngo bo), definition (nges tshig), nature (rang bzhin), dharmatā proper (chos nyid), and boundary (sa mtshams). The structure employs scriptural citation (Thal 'gyur), etymological analysis, and dialectical reasoning to establish precise technical understanding.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5438-5441]: phyi 'od lnga'i snang ba (outer five-light vision): perceptual dimension of exhaustion. nang rdos bcas rtog tshogs (inner with subtle body thought-aggregates): cognitive-somatic dimension. nyams snang gi yul (experience-vision objects): phenomenal content.

Line [5450-5456]: chos (dharma/phenomena): lus ngag sems kyi tshogs pa (body-speech-mind aggregates) including nyon mongs (afflictions). zad pa (exhaustion): stong pa (emptiness/void), blo'i sgom pa yul snang dang bcas pa rang log nas med (meditation's objects with appearance self-reverse into non-existence).

Line [5457]: mi dmigs pa (non-observation): epistemological state where subject-object duality collapses; Madhyamaka term adapted for Dzogchen context.

[CONTEXT] This passage provides systematic philosophical analysis of the fourth vision's culmination. The fivefold definitional schema (ngo bo, nges tshig, rang bzhin, chos nyid, sa mtshams) derives from Indian pramāṇa tradition applied to Dzogchen phenomenology. The Thal 'gyur citation authenticates the technical description within the Snying thig lineage. The equation of exhaustion with emptiness (stong pa) reflects the integration of Madhyamaka and Dzogchen soteriologies—exhaustion is not mere cessation but recognition of primordial emptiness.

[CONCEPT]
• Fivefold definitional schema:
  - Essence (ngo bo): outer-inner-secret dimensions of exhaustion
  - Definition (nges tshig): phenomena as aggregates with afflictions
  - Nature (rang bzhin): spontaneous dissolution of appearance-emptiness
  - Dharmatā: path appearances with luminous-clear meditation
  - Boundary: transition point from manifestation to pure domain

• Exhaustion mechanics:
  - Experience-vision empties (nyams kyi snang ba stongs)
  - Body exhausted, sense-objects exhausted (lus zad dbang po'i yul yang zad)
  - Thought-aggregates liberated from delusion (rtog tshogs 'khrul pa las grol)
  - Beyond expression and ground (brjod gzhis tshig dang bral)

• Non-observation (mi dmigs pa):
  - Meditation and objects self-reverse
  - Beyond conceptuality yet not void
  - Dharmatā as ultimate fact (don gyi 'bras bu)
