[12970-12986] [STRUCTURE] ## Transference Ritual: The Six Signs and Vase-Washing
**Analysis:** This section details the *'pho ba* (transference of consciousness) ritual mechanics, specifically the "six signs" (*rtags drug*) that indicate successful consciousness navigation. The vase-washing ritual (*bum pa bkrus pa*) serves as a metaphorical and actual purification process where wisdom-water washes away karmic obscurations.

[12970] [CONCEPT] Consciousness-Expanded-Into Great-Sameness
**Analysis:** *Shes pa mnyam pa chen por bskyil ba* refers to the expansion of consciousness into the Great Expanse of Sameness (*mnyam pa chen po*). This is the preparatory stage of transference where ordinary consciousness dissolves into the universal ground.

[12972-12974] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Analysis: *kyis* (Instrumental)
**Analysis:** The particle *kyis* marks the instrumental case, indicating the means by which purification occurs: "washed-if" (*bkrus na*) establishes the conditional nature of the ritual efficacy. The ablative *las* in "emptied-from" indicates extraction from the god realms.

[12978-13001] [CONTEXT] Human Body as Migration Lord
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the *mi'i lus* (human body) as the *'gro ba'i rje* (lord of migrations). This follows the classic Nyingma view that human existence represents the optimal balance of pleasure and pain for liberation. The text contrasts gods (*lha*) who cannot practice virtue effectively with humans who possess the basis for renunciation.

[12991-12992] [CONCEPT] The Migration Lord Distinction
**Analysis:** The assertion that "migration's lord god not-is / migration's lord human is" encapsulates the tantric anthropology: gods lack renunciation basis (*nges 'byung*), while humans possess the full capacity for virtue accumulation (*bsags pa*) and special practices.

[13001-13003] [STRUCTURE] ## Third Stage: Corpse-Without Purification
**Analysis:** The transition to the "third" stage indicates progressive refinement of the transference method, moving from coarse to subtle levels of consciousness transfer.
