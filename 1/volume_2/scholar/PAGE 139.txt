[STRUCTURE] This page continues the bhūmi analysis with eleventh and twelfth grounds [6021-6040], distinctions between those who maintain and abandon the retreat center [6041-6060], and scriptural citation [6061-6080]. The structure employs enumeration, comparative analysis, and phenomenological description of advanced stages.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [6021-6040]: bcu gcig kun tu 'od (eleventh Universal Light): 'khrul snang 'gags (delusory appearance ceases), tshom bu'i snang ba (sphere vision). bcu gnyis ma chags padma can (twelfth Lotus Holder Non-Attachment): phyir nang gi chos thams cad kyis ma gos pa (not stained by all outer-inner dharmas).

Line [6041-6060]: sbubs bor ba (abandoned retreat center): those who left the practice container. sbubs ma bor ba (not abandoned retreat center): those who maintained it. khyad par (distinction): difference between these two types.

Line [6061-6080]: Verse citation on thugs ka (heart center), ye shes kyi zer thag (wisdom light-rays), nam mkha'i mthongs (sky's expanse), 'od kyi tshom bu lnga (five light spheres), 'khor lo (wheel/chakra).

[CONTEXT] This passage extends the bhūmi analysis beyond the classical ten to eleven and twelve, reflecting Dzogchen's expansion of the bodhisattva path. The distinction between those who maintain (sbubs ma bor ba) and abandon (sbubs bor ba) the retreat center reflects the institutional context of Dzogchen practice—long-term retreat (sbubs) as prerequisite for advanced realization. The eleventh bhūmi (Universal Light) marks cessation of delusory appearance, while the twelfth (Lotus Holder Non-Attachment) indicates complete freedom from all phenomenal stains. The heart-center imagery and five light spheres reflect subtle body physiology integrated with cosmic symbolism.

  - Institutional context of practice

• Advanced phenomenology:
  - Heart center wisdom rays
  - Five light spheres in sky expanse
  - Wheel configuration (chakra)
  - Non-stained by outer-inner dharmas
