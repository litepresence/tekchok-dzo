[8531-8570] [STRUCTURE] Samādhi Progression and Gradual Attainment
**Analysis:** This page presents samādhi progression and addresses the gradual vs. sudden attainment issue. The structure includes citation on gradual perfection through familiarization with three bodies, followed by analysis of the non-sudden nature of realization despite Dzogchen's claim to suddenness.

[8531-8545] [PHILOLOGY] Gradual Perfection Citation
**Analysis:** The verse citation presents:
- *Ting 'dzin dang po cog gzhag gis*: first samādhi through mere settling
- *Sku gsum rim gyis goms pa yis*: through gradual familiarization with three bodies
- *Dngos po gshis kyi rnal 'byor la*: to yoga of entity-nature
- *Don 'dis mchog tu nye bar 'gyur*: becomes very near to supreme

Key terms:
- *Rim gyis*: gradual, in stages
- *Goms pa*: familiarization, habituation
- *Cog gzhag*: mere settling, resting

[8546-8548] [CONCEPT] The Paradox of Gradual Development
**Analysis:** The text presents a crucial paradox:
- *Cig car skye ba ma yin te*: not arising suddenly/instantly
- *'Di kun rim gyis blo yul lo*: all this is gradual, object of mind

This acknowledges that despite Dzogchen's emphasis on sudden recognition (*cig car*), the stabilization of that recognition occurs gradually.

[8549-8560] [CONTEXT] Three Bodies Familiarization
**Analysis:** The three bodies (*sku gsum*) progression:
1. First: attaining Nirmāṇakāya (*thog ma ting 'dzin sprul sku thob*)
2. Previously unseen dharmas appear spontaneously (*sngar ma mthong ba'i chos rnams bsams pa med par blo la 'char*)
3. Without grasping conceptual words (*ma bzung bzhin du*), mind clarifies

This represents the gradual path (*rim gyis*) even within Dzogchen.

[8561-8570] [STRUCTURE] Fruitional Experience
**Analysis:** The fruitional dimension:
- *Skyes bu skal dang ldan pa la*: for fortunate beings
- *Chos kyi ro yis sems rgyas pas*: mind expands through taste of Dharma
- *Rjes kyi las can du 'gyur*: becomes one with after-effect karma

The "taste of Dharma" (*chos kyi ro*) indicates non-conceptual fruitional experience that transforms the practitioner.

[8536-8540] [PHILOLOGY] *Nye bar 'gyur* and *Mchog*
**Analysis:** The phrase *mchog tu nye bar 'gyur* (becomes very near to supreme):
- *Mchog*: supreme, ultimate
- *Nye bar 'gyur*: approaches, becomes near
- Indicates progressive approximation to full awakening

This terminology bridges the apparent contradiction between Dzogchen's "already complete" view and the need for practice.
