[STRUCTURE] This page continues the analysis of three stabilizations focusing on vision [5769-5784], introduces the four measures (tshad bzhi) [5785-5795], and presents the three perfect knowledges (gzhi shes gsum) [5796-5810]. The structure employs enumeration, scriptural citation, and definitional analysis, concluding with teleological synthesis.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5769-5784]: 'od la 'phrig pa med par sdod pa (stabilization without flickering in light): vision stabilization one. rig pa la 'phrig pa med pa (without wavering in awareness): two. sku la 'dar ba med pa (without trembling in form): three. dbang bzhi (four empowerments): anuttarayoga tantric initiations.

Line [5785-5795]: tshad bzhi (four measures): lus kyi tshad (body measure—dbang bzhi'i gzhi la nges pa), ngag gi tshad (speech measure—dbang bzhi'i lam nges pa), sems kyi tshad (mind measure—dbang bzhi'i 'bras bu nges pa), phyir mi ldog pa'i tshad (non-return measure).

Line [5796-5810]: gzhi shes gsum (three ground knowledges): gzhi (ground), lam (path), 'bras bu (result). yid ches (confidence/faith): epistemic trust. phyir ldog (return): regression from realization.

[CONTEXT] This passage integrates tantric empowerment theory (dbang bzhi) with Dzogchen stabilization practice. The four measures establish concrete criteria for progress: body measure through empowerment basis certainty, speech measure through empowerment path certainty, mind measure through empowerment result certainty, and non-return measure through irreversibility. The three ground knowledges parallel the classical Buddhist triad of ground-path-result but reconceived from Dzogchen's spontaneous perspective. The emphasis on "four visions arriving at measure" (snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa) as irreversible indicates the point of no return on the path.

[CONCEPT]
• Four measures (tshad bzhi):
  - Body: four empowerments' basis certainty
  - Speech: four empowerments' path certainty  
  - Mind: four empowerments' result certainty
  - Non-return: irreversible from liberation

• Four signs of body measure completion:
  - Four empowerments' basis obtained
  - Four signs: body light, speech melody, mind non-conceptual
  - Body karmic outflows exhausted
  - Spontaneous completion of realization

• Three ground knowledges (gzhi shes gsum):
  - Ground: original purity recognized
  - Path: meditation without separation
  - Result: confidence in attainment
  - Teleology: three times equality
