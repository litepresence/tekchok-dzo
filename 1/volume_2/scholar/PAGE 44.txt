[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2215-2270]
Page 44 presents two major textual units: (1) the continuation and completion of the vajra song section with extensive Sanskrit mantra citation (lines 2215-2238), and (2) the dharmata song section (lines 2239-2262) followed by the benefits of song dance (glu gar gyi phan yon; lines 2263-2270). The structural organization marks a transition from technical ritual instruction to the philosophical exposition of the songs' ultimate nature.

The Sanskrit citation (lines 2215-2238) comprises a complex liturgical sequence combining bija syllables, deity names, and dharani formulas. This represents the continuation of the vajra song verbal techniques introduced in the previous page. The dharmata song section (lines 2239-2262) then presents the ultimate meaning of song as the self-expression of Samantabhadra (kun bzang yab yum), shifting from formal technique to spontaneous wisdom-display.

[PHILOLOGY]
[SANSKRIT MANTRA ANALYSIS] - The page presents an extensive liturgical sequence requiring philological analysis:

Lines 2215-2238 contain Sanskrit mantras in Tibetan transcription:
- Sa mi ta pu ru pu ru (likely "samita puru puru" - fully pacified)
- Ku ta li ma su ma su (possibly "kutali masu masu")
- I ka ra su li bha ta ye (invocational formula)
- Tsa ki ra bhu li sa la ye (dakini-related mantra)
- Sa mun+ta tsar+Ya su b+ha yai (auspiciousness invocation)
- B+he ta sa b+h+ya ku le yai (fearlessness formula)
- Sa ka ri d+hU ka na (dakini name)
- Ma ta ri bai ta na (goddess invocation)
- Ba ra li hi sA na
- Ma kharta ki la nAM (wrathful deity)
- SaM b+ha ra ta me ka tsang+taM pa
- Sur+Ya ta ra e pa sha na pa (solar deity)
- Ra na b+hi ti sa b+hu ra lA pa
- Ma smin sa gu li ta ya pa
- 'Gu ra 'gu rA sa ga kha ra na lI
- Na ra na rA i thar pa TA la (liberation formula)
- Sir na sir Ne b+he sa ras pa laM
- Bhun rda bhun rda tshiSha sa ke laM

The sequence concludes with bija syllables (lines 2233-2238):
- sa sA / ri rI / li lI / a AI / mi mI / ra ra rA

These represent the five seed syllables in their short and long forms, forming a sonic mandala.

[TERM: chos nyid kyi glu] - Wylie: chos nyid kyi glu. "Dharmata song." Technical term distinguishing the ultimate nature of song (expressing the dharmata, the nature of phenomena) from conventional vajra song technique. The phrase indicates spontaneous wisdom-expression rather than deliberate composition.

[TERM: kun bzang yab yum] - Wylie: kun bzang yab yum. "Samantabhadra father-mother." The primordial buddha couple representing the union of awareness (yab; male, space) and emptiness (yum; female, wisdom). The dharmata song is described as their "aim" (dgongs pa) or expressive intention.

[TERM: ma skyes pas na mi 'gag] - Wylie: ma skyes pas na mi 'gag. "By not-born, not-cease." Technical phrase from the dharmata song indicating the primordial nature of phenomena: because they have never arisen (ma skyes), they never cease (mi 'gag). This reflects the Madhyamika doctrine of non-origination applied to Dzogchen cosmology.

[TERM: kun tu khyab] - Wylie: kun tu khyab. "All-pervading." Technical descriptor of dharmata as omnipresent, without center or boundary. The term khyab (to pervade) functions as a key descriptor in Dzogchen epistemology.

[TERM: bde chen chos mchog] - Wylie: bde chen chos mchog. "Great bliss, supreme dharma." Compound epithet for the nature of mind as simultaneously blissful (bde chen) and the supreme teaching (chos mchog). This integrates the tantric emphasis on bliss with the sutric emphasis on dharma.

[TERM: mkha' mnyam] - Wylie: mkha' mnyam. "Sky-equal." Technical Dzogchen term describing the equal nature of liberation—like space, without partiality or distinction. The sky serves as the primary metaphor for the nature of mind in Dzogchen literature.

[TERM: ye grol lhun mnyam] - Wylie: ye grol lhun mnyam. "Primordially liberated, spontaneously equal." Compound technical term encapsulating two core Dzogchen concepts: primordial liberation (ye grol) and spontaneous equality (lhun mnyam). Together, these indicate that enlightenment is not achieved but naturally present.

[TERM: khyab gdal khang bzangs] - Wylie: khyab gdal khang bzangs. "Pervade expanse palace." Metaphor for the nature of mind as a spacious mansion (khang bzangs) that pervades (khyab) and expands (gdal) without limit.

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor - Benefits Section] - Lines 2264-2270 cite the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra on the benefits (phan yon) of vajra song:
1. Chief method of yogin (rnal 'byor thabs kyi gtso)
2. Sound-not vajra song (grag pa med pa rdo rje'i glu)
3. Satisfies all buddha minds (sangs rgyas kun gyi yid kyang tshim)
4. Yogin's experience companion (rnal 'byor pa yi nyams kyi grogs)
5. Captures dakini minds (mkha' 'gro ma yi yid rnams 'phrog)
6. Turns six-type samsara clinging (rigs drug 'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog)

These benefits frame vajra song as simultaneously: (a) a method for the yogin, (b) an offering to buddhas, (c) a support for experience, and (d) a means of liberating beings in the six realms.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Bija Syllable System] - The page's bija syllable sequence (lines 2233-2238) represents the sonic dimension of tantric cosmology. Each syllable corresponds to:
- sa: Akshobhya/buddha family
- ri: Amitabha/lotus family
- li: Amoghasiddhi/karma family
- a: Vairochana/buddha family
- mi: Ratnasambhava/jewel family
- ra: additional resonance

This systematic employment of seed syllables reflects the integration of sonic yoga (sgra'i rnal 'byor) into Nyingma practice.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Mantra as Dharmata Expression] - The page demonstrates two levels of vajra song:
1. CONVENTIONAL: The Sanskrit mantras (lines 2215-2238) function as deliberate ritual speech
2. ULTIMATE: The dharmata song (lines 2239-2262) expresses the nature of phenomena directly

The transition from the former to the latter reflects the Nyingma hermeneutical principle: all conventional practices ultimately point to the natural state. The elaborate mantra recitation is not an end in itself but a support for recognizing the dharmata song that is spontaneously present.

[ANALYSIS: Dharmata Song Content] - The dharmata song verses (lines 2240-2261) enumerate sixteen aspects of dharmata:
1. Not-born, not-cease
2. No going, no coming, all-pervading
3. Great bliss, supreme dharma, unmoving
4. Sky-equal liberation, no stain
5. No root, no support
6. No abode, no taking, great dharma
7. Primordially liberated, spontaneously equal, great expanse
8. No binding, no releasing
9. Pervade expanse palace, primordially existent
10. Beyond pervade, not-decline
11. Great expanse, sky expanse
12. Great dharma blazing, sun-moon center
13. Direct, spontaneously accomplished
14. Great vajra mountain, great lotus
15. Wisdom song, sun lion
16. Great sound music, unequalled

This enumeration serves as both descriptive cosmology and contemplative instruction—the practitioner contemplates each quality as an aspect of their own mind.

[ANALYSIS: Song Benefits Typology] - The six benefits (lines 2265-2270) organize vajra song function according to recipient:
1. For the yogin: chief method (thabs kyi gtso)
2. For the practice: sound-not (grag pa med pa)
3. For the buddhas: mind-satisfaction (yid... tshim)
4. For the yogin's experience: companion (grogs)
5. For the dakinis: mind-capture (yid... 'phrog)
6. For beings: clinging-reversal (zhen pa bzlog)

This multi-directional benefit structure reflects the Mahayana principle that practice serves self and others simultaneously.

[ANALYSIS: The Six Realms Liberation] - The final benefit—turning six-type samsara clinging (rigs drug 'khor ba'i zhen pa bzlog)—indicates that vajra song functions as a means of liberating beings in all six realms (god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost, hell). The sonic dimension of practice is thus not merely personal cultivation but universal benefit.
