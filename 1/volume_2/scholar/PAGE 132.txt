[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum) and three stabilizations (sdod pa gsum) through enumeration markers [5646-5760], causal analysis [5761-5768], and concluding synthesis. The structure employs tripartite division (body, wind, vision) with three subdivisions each, creating a ninefold schema of stabilization.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5646-5650]: tshig gi 'dre ldog (word's reversal/counter): reversal of conceptual fixation. tshig rang byung gi ye shes (word self-arisen wisdom): spontaneous wisdom beyond language. rang gi brjod pa (self-expression): auto-communication of realization.

Line [5651-5653]: gtad pa'i 'bem (focused inert): concentrated fixation. sangs rgyas kyi dgongs pa (buddha's intent): enlightened perspective. dbyings kyi go rar tshud pa (entered domain's portal): access to expanse.

Line [5657-5660]: 'gul bas 'gyu 'gyus pas ldog pa (reverse by moving-agitation): technical definition of immovability—freedom from fluctuation. gnyen po (antidote): counteractive factor.

Line [5671-5685]: Body three stabilizations: las dang bral ba (free from activity), 'khrul pa 'phel med (delusion not increase), las kyi rnam smin dang bral ba (free from action's ripening). Wind three stabilizations: rkyen snang tha dad pas gnod pa med (conditions' various appearances not harm), rnam rtog tha dad kyi rten med (various thoughts' support not exist), 'khor 'das gnyis su 'dzin pa'i gzhi stongs pa (samsara-nirvana duality's basis empty).

[CONTEXT] This passage presents the stabilization phase of Dzogchen practice—the consolidation of recognition into unshakeable realization. The three immovabilities correspond to three gates (body, speech/wind, mind/vision), while the three stabilizations provide more detailed phenomenology of each. The "focused inert" (gtad pa'i 'bem) refers to concentrated fixation that must be transcended—the paradox of effortful non-effort. The "portal of the domain" (dbyings kyi go ra) terminology derives from Mahāyoga spatial metaphors for Dzogchen expanse. The passage reflects Longchenpa's systematic presentation of practice phases beyond initial recognition.

[CONCEPT]
• Three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum):
  - Body: free from activity fixation
  - Speech/wind: free from conditionality
  - Mind/vision: free from samsara-nirvana duality

• Three stabilizations (sdod pa gsum) detailed:
  - Body: activity non-abiding, limb extension-contraction ceased, activity established in ground
  - Wind: not going outward, not held inward, no going-coming
  - Vision: no flickering in light, no wavering in awareness, no trembling in form

• Ninefold schema:
  - Each gate has three degrees of stabilization
  - Progressive deepening from coarse to subtle
  - Culminating in four measures of body, speech, mind
