[8083-8125] [STRUCTURE] Dissolution of Phenomena and Liberation
**Analysis:** This page presents the dissolution of saṃsāra into namelessness (*ming med*) and the distinctive excellence of liberation into light (*'od du grol ba*). The structure emphasizes the *Thal 'gyur* (Consequentialist) approach: pointing out self-nature without dependent conditions.

[8083-8084] [PHILOLOGY] *'Khor ba ming med du lta zlos*
**Analysis:** The phrase *'khor ba ming med du lta zlos* (saṃsāra rolls into namelessness) employs:
- *Ming med* (nameless): beyond all designation
- *Zlos* (rolls/circles): dynamic dissolution
- Indicates the transcending of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dichotomy

[8085-8087] [CONTEXT] *Thal 'gyur* Citation
**Analysis:** The *Thal 'gyur* citation:
- *'Di ni rang yul bstan pa las* (from showing self-object)
- *'Khor rkyen 'jug pa ma yin pa* (not entering through dependent conditions)

This establishes the direct pointing approach of Dzogchen, bypassing gradual accumulation.

[8088-8125] [CONCEPT] Cutting Through vs. Direct Transcendence
**Analysis:** The distinction between two practices:

**Cutting Through** (*khregs chod*):
- Clarifying the six sense-faculties (*dbang po drug gi sgo*)
- Seeking the nature of mind (*sems kyi chos la dwangs 'tshol*)

**Direct Transcendence** (*thod rgal*):
- Pure luminosity (*dag pa 'od gsal*) gateway
- Wisdom wind (*ye shes kyi rlung*) propelling
- Four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) appearing

The page establishes the complementarity of these two approaches within Dzogchen practice.

[8126-8127] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology
**Analysis:** Key terms:
- *Khregs chod*: Cutting through solidified conceptual structures
- *Thod rgal*: Direct transcendence through luminous appearances
- *Sgron ma bzhi*: Four lamps (eye, heart, bindu, dharmatā)
- *Ye shes kyi rlung*: Wisdom wind/prana

[8128-8140] [STRUCTURE] Direct Transcendence Methodology
**Analysis:** The *De nyid las* citation explains the manifestation process:
- *Sgo nas ji ltar 'byung ba ni* (how it arises from the gateway)
- *'Jug pa'i rlung gis bskul ba yis* (propelled by entering wind)

This describes the physiology of light manifestation in advanced Dzogchen practice.
