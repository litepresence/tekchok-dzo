[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2447-2476]
Page 49 presents the detailed exposition of the twenty-one progressive trainings of mind-holding (sems 'dzin bslab rim nyer gcig), which form the technical core of the meditation section. The structural organization follows the threefold condensation mentioned in the Thal 'gyur citation:

1. Placing on the ground (gnas su bzhag pa) - lines 2459-2469
2. Separating body-mind (lus sems dbral ba) - line 2460
3. Seeing dharmata (chos nyid mthong ba) - line 2461

The first section (lines 2462-2476) presents seven characteristics (bdun gyi mtshan ma) for placing self-mind on the ground:
- White A meditation (lines 2462-2470)
- Pha/PHAT meditation for dullness (lines 2471-2472)
- Wrathful laughter HA meditation (lines 2473-2474)
- Asura dispute meditation (lines 2475-2476, continued on next page)

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: sems 'dzin] - Wylie: sems 'dzin. "Mind-holding." Technical term for techniques that stabilize and focus the mind. The term dzin (holding, grasping) indicates active engagement rather than passive resting. Distinct from sems bzhag (mind-placing), which suggests a more relaxed approach.

[TERM: bslab rim] - Wylie: bslab rim. "Progressive training" or "graduated cultivation." Technical term indicating systematic, sequential practice. The phrase bslab rim nyer gcig specifies twenty-one stages of this training.

[TERM: gnas su bzhag pa] - Wylie: gnas su bzhag pa. "Placing on the ground" or "settling in place." Technical phrase indicating the establishment of stable attention. The term gnas (ground, place, abode) suggests firm establishment.

[TERM: lus sems dbral ba] - Wylie: lus sems dbral ba. "Separating body-mind." Technical phrase indicating the loosening of identification between physical form and consciousness. This is a preliminary to recognizing mind's nature.

[TERM: bdun gyi mtshan ma] - Wylie: bdun gyi mtshan ma. "Seven characteristics" or "seven signs." Technical term for specific meditation supports or focal points used in mind-holding practice.

[TERM: a dkar] - Wylie: a dkar. "White A." The Tibetan letter A in white color, visualized at the nose-tip as a meditation support. The letter A represents the unborn nature of phenomena and serves as a universal focal point.

[TERM: skyil krung] - Wylie: skyil krung. "Cross-legged posture" or "vajra posture." The standard meditation posture with legs crossed. The term indicates the physical foundation for meditation practice.

[TERM: snar 'tsher ba] - Wylie: snar 'tsher ba. "Projecting at the nose" or "shining at the tip." Technical phrase describing the visualization of the white A at the nose-tip (sna rtser). The term 'tsher suggests radiance or projection.

[TERM: rlung phar 'gro] - Wylie: rlung phar 'gro. "Wind goes out." Technical phrase describing exhalation in the context of meditation. The visualization of the A moving with the breath coordinates attention with subtle energy.

[TERM: tshad nad] - Wylie: tshad nad. "Hot disease" or "fever." Technical medical term indicating excess heat in the body. The meditation technique adapts to physical conditions by using cooling visualizations.

[TERM: grang nad] - Wylie: grang nad. "Cold disease" or "chill." Technical medical term indicating excess cold. The technique uses heating visualizations (tsha reg) to counteract.

[TERM: yengs su bcug] - Wylie: yengs su bcug. "Caused to distract." Technical phrase indicating the deliberate scattering of attention as a technique—unusual in meditation instructions, suggesting that scattering is sometimes necessary before re-gathering.

[TERM: phaT] - Wylie: phaT. The seed syllable PHAT, used wrathfully to cut through dullness (bying ba). PHAT is traditionally associated with severing conceptual mind and arousing awareness.

[TERM: drag por brjod] - Wylie: drag por brjod. "Say fiercely" or "speak wrathfully." Technical instruction for the vocalization of PHAT. The fierce quality cuts through torpor.

[TERM: rtog med had de ba] - Wylie: rtog med had de ba. "Thought-free ha-de-ba." Technical phrase describing the quality of awareness that arises: free of conceptual thought (rtog med) and vividly present (had de ba).

[TERM: gsal gdangs] - Wylie: gsal gdangs. "Clear resonance" or "clarity-sonority." Technical term for the luminous, resonant quality of awareness. Combines gsal (clear) with gdangs (resonance, sound).

[TERM: lha ma yin] - Wylie: lha ma yin. "Not-god" or "demigod." Standard Tibetan term for asura—the jealous gods who constantly war with the gods. Their conduct of quarrel and dispute represents aggressive, competitive mental energy.

[TERM: tsog pus sgril] - Wylie: tsog pus sgril. "Hunched body roll." Technical phrase describing a specific posture: body curled with head lowered (literally "head first hunched").

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: De nyid las] - Lines 2447-2458 cite "from that itself" (de nyid las), referencing the Thal 'gyur tantra previously mentioned. The passage condenses the twenty-one mind-holdings into three:
1. Placing on the ground
2. Separating body-mind
3. Seeing dharmata

And specifies the three piths (gnad gsum): body, speech, and mind.

[SCRIPTURAL SOURCE: Mind-Holding Twenty-One] - The twenty-one mind-holdings are detailed in the Nyi zla kha sbyor and related Nyingma meditation manuals. The presentation here adapts these traditional forms to the Dzogchen context.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Gradual Techniques in Dzogchen] - The presentation of progressive techniques (bslab rim) might seem contradictory to the Dzogchen emphasis on primordial liberation. However, this reflects the Nyingma pedagogical principle that gradual techniques serve as supports for recognizing the non-gradual nature. The techniques are "skillful means" (thabs) rather than the ultimate truth.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: White A Meditation Mechanics] - Lines 2462-2470 present the foundational technique:
1. POSTURE: Suitable ground, comfortable cushion, cross-legged posture
2. VISUALIZATION: White A at nose-tip, shining/projecting
3. BREATH COORDINATION: A moves with breath—out with exhalation, in with inhalation
4. ADAPTATION: Hot disease → visualize cold A; cold disease → visualize hot A
5. TRAINING: Day and night continuous practice
6. RESULT: Uncommon experience of mind free from emanating-gathering

The technique integrates visualization (dmigs pa), breath (rlung), and physical posture (gnad) to stabilize attention.

[ANALYSIS: Therapeutic Adaptation] - Lines 2467-2468 present the medical application of meditation:
- Hot disease (tshad nad) → visualize cold A (grang reg)
- Cold disease (grang nad) → visualize hot A (tsha reg)

This reflects the Tibetan medical principle of counteracting imbalances through mental intervention. The visualization of temperature qualities affects the body's elemental balance.

[ANALYSIS: PHAT Meditation for Dullness] - Lines 2471-2472 present a technique for cutting through dullness (bying ba):
1. Brief distraction (dar cig shes pa yengs su bcug)
2. Fierce PHAT utterance (phaT ces drag por brjod)
3. Thought-free awareness arises (rtog med had de ba)
4. Hold mind without thought-arising (rtog pa ma langs kyi bar sems bzung)
5. Result: Emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation (sems stong gsal rang gdangs kyi sgom pa)

This demonstrates the wrathful method—using intensity to cut through torpor.

[ANALYSIS: HA Meditation for Clarity] - Lines 2473-2474 present the wrathful laughter technique:
1. Say HA fiercely and short (ha drag la thung bar brjod)
2. Place mind as before (snga ma ltar sems gtad)
3. Result: Thought-free clear resonance experience (rtog med gsal gdangs kyi nyams)

The HA syllable represents the spontaneous joy of awareness, used here to arouse clarity.

[ANALYSIS: Asura Dispute Meditation] - Lines 2475-2476 begin presenting the technique for working with aggressive energy:
1. LOCATION: Mountain-peak or rock-top
2. POSTURE: Hunched body roll with head first
3. MOVEMENT: Slow body movement (lus sgul bskyod dal bar bya)
4. DURATION: Three-four days of this practice

The asura (lha ma yin) represents aggressive, competitive mental energy. Rather than suppressing it, this technique channels it through specific posture and movement.
