[4720-4733] [STRUCTURE] Three Eyes and Their Functions
**Analysis:** The section presents a detailed analysis of the three eyes (*spyan gsum*) and their respective empowerments (*byin rlabs*). The structure follows a triadic pattern:
1. Dharmakaya eye empowerment (4720-4721): Enables direct seeing of wisdom
2. Sambhogakaya eye empowerment (4721-4723): Enables self-clear seeing, expands knowledge
3. Nirmanakaya eye empowerment (4723-4725): Enables seeing free from sound-words, dawns dharmata meaning

Each section uses the construction "eye exists in X, by its empowerment sees Y, result Z"—creating a formal logical structure. The section concludes with definitional analysis (*nges tshig*) at 4732-4733.

[4720-4733] [PHILOLOGY] Particle Functions and Epistemic Markers
**Analysis:** The ablative *-las* in *'khor ba las grol* (4726, 4733) marks liberation-from, while the instrumental *-kyis* in *chos nyid kyi spyan* (4719) marks the eye as the agent of dharmata-seeing. The term *thag chod* (decided/resolved) at 4720 functions as an epistemic marker indicating certainty. The phrase *gsum du nges* (determined as three) at 4728, 4731 appears as a hermeneutical formula establishing the sufficiency of the triadic classification. The particle *ste* in *rtogs byed thams cad dag nas* (4725) marks the locus of purification: from all conceptual activity.

[4725-4727] [CONTEXT] Technical Integration of Gaze and Liberation
**Analysis:** The three gazes are presented as technical operations:
1. **Dharmata eye upward gaze** (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog*): Clears latencies (*bag chags*) downward—the "upward" indicates transcendent direction
2. **Wisdom eye equal-corner gaze** (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas*): Equalizes samsara-nirvana taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam*)
3. **Discriminating awareness eye lowered gaze** (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas*): Brings down wisdom vision (*ye shes kyi snang ba*)

The voice at 4728-4731 is Longchenpa's synthetic commentary, providing psychological (*blo*) correlations for gaze selection: laziness (*le lo*) → Sambhogakaya, diligence (*brtson 'grus*) → Nirmanakaya, equanimity (*btang snyoms*) → Dharmakaya. This reflects *kusala-mula* (skillful root) typology from Abhidharma.

[4734-4748] [CONCEPT] Field-Pith: Outer and Inner Dimensions
**Analysis:** The section treats the second pith: field (*yul gyi gnad*). Two dimensions are established:
1. **Outer field** (4734-4740): Sky-space empty, separate from clouds (*sprin dang bral ba*)
2. **Inner field** (4735-4742): Between eyebrows (*smin mtshams*) at *mdzod spu* (treasure-hair/urna)

The inner field creates specific visionary experiences (*dbyings snang mthing ga*—blue dhatu-vision) and the five radiances (*'od lnga*). The text at 4743-4745 establishes the non-dual (*gnyis su med*) nature of awareness and experience (*rig pa dang nyams*), calling this "samsara-nirvana mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*). This reflects the *advaya* (non-dual) position distinguishing Dzogchen from Madhyamaka's *advaita* (non-difference).

The prohibition at 4746-4748 against using coarse elements (*'byung bzhi'i dngos po*) as objects reflects the critique of *kasina* practices and similar concentration techniques in favor of "objectless" (*yul med*) meditation.
