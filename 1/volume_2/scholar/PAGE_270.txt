PAGE 270 ANALYSIS

[11716-11725] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** This page completes the sound category with root tantra citation and introduces the FIFTH category: G.YO BA (movement/earthquake). The structural pattern of fourfold analysis continues (nature, cause, divisions, result). The movement category represents the transition from subtle phenomena (light, sound) to gross somatic/environmental manifestations. The binary temporal schema (seven days vs. fourteen days) parallels previous categories, maintaining systematic consistency.

[11716-11723] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Root tantra citation from rDo rje Sems dpa'i Snying gi Me long continues, employing technical terminology: འུར་གྱིས་བྱུང་ (arising through humming) vs. ཐུག་གིས་བྱུང་ (arising through piercing sound). Temporal markers ཞག་བདུན་ (seven days) and ཞག་བཅུ་བཞི་ (fourteen days) use classical Tibetan time reckoning. The structural divider "ལྔ་པ་" (fifth) at 11720 introduces movement category with abbreviated analytical headings (only four components without explicit nature heading initially).

[11716-11725] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The seven-day vs. fourteen-day distinction reflects different capacities of practitioners - those with prior familiarization (sbyangs pa) versus those requiring extended stabilization. This temporal framework derives from the Abhidharma kosha's analysis of bardo duration and the Guhyasamaja tantra's completion stage timing. The sound-arousal types ('ur vs. thug) may correspond to the "light-sound-rays" (od sgra zer) triad fundamental to rdzogs chen cosmogony.

[11724-11744] [STRUCTURE]
**Analysis:** Movement analysis establishes a hierarchical taxonomy: 1) container world as support, 2) animate beings as supported. This reflects the standard Buddhist "container and contained" (snod bcud) cosmological framework. The fourfold division of movement (rab tu g.yo ba, cher g.yo ba, kun tu rab tu g.yo ba, and implied fourth) creates scalar intensity. The results section maps movement onto bodhisattva stages (sa), creating a comprehensive soteriological cartography.

[11724-11744] [PHILOLOGY]
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: སྣོད་ཀྱི་འོག་གཞི་ (container world's base) - standard Abhidharma term for the physical world as "vessel" for sentient beings. སྐྱེ་འགྲོ་ (animate beings) contrasts with སྣོད་ (container). ནུས་པས་རླུང་བསྐུལ་ (power/mastery propels wind) - indicates tantric wind-energy (vayu/rlung) mechanics. The phrase ཐུན་མོང་བ་ (common/shared) vs. special indicates path typology. Bodhisattva stage terminology follows Dasabhumika Sutra enumeration (rab tu dga' ba, etc.).

[11730-11760] [CONTEXT]
**Analysis:** The three temporal divisions (three days, six days, nine days) for different stage-attainments create a precise soteriological chronometry. The enumeration of sravaka stages (four) and bodhisattva stages (ten + one result stage) reflects standard Mahayana path structures from the Abhisamayalamkara. The four vidyadhara stages (rig 'dzin sa bzhi) - matured, life-mastery, mahamudra, spontaneous accomplishment - derive specifically from the Maha-yoga and Anu-yoga tantra systems, particularly the Guhyagarbha tantra.

[11724-11760] [CONCEPT]
**Analysis:** The ontological mechanism: the deceased's mastery (nus pa) activates wind-energy (rlung) causing physical movement. This reflects the tantric "vajra body" theory where consciousness-winds animate the physical realm. The scalar typology of movement intensity correlates with realization depth - greater movement indicates higher attainment. The bodhisattva stage mapping demonstrates the text's syncretic integration of sutra and tantra path structures, a hallmark of the rNying ma scholastic tradition. The qualification that these practitioners "do not quickly attain results" (myur du 'bras bu mi thob) introduces important nuance about path differences - sravakas and bodhisattvas require extended cultivation compared to tantric instantaneous liberators.
