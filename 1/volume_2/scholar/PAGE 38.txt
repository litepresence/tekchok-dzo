[1944-1958] [CONTEXT] Physical Marks of the Suitable Vessel
**Analysis:** The *Rang Shar* tantra enumerates the physical characteristics marking one as a suitable vessel (*snod*) for Great Perfection teachings. These are not social privileges but somatic indicators of subtle body capacity:

**Physical Marks:**
- Male or female (*pho mo gnyis*)—gender non-specific
- Specific coloration (*kha dog 'di dang ldan pa*) indicating constitutional type
- Thick limbs (*yan lag rags shing*)
- Nose with good coloration (*kha dog*)
- Teeth white like conch (*so nyid thags bzangs dkar la 'dril*)
- Eye corners slightly red (*mig rtsa yid tsam dmar ba*)
- Hair characteristics: curls to the right (*g.yas su 'khyil*), black color (*kham nag mdog*)
- Small body/limited stature (*lus la bkur sti chung ba*)—not imposing presence
- Ordinary external conduct (*phyi yi spyod lam tha mal mdog*)
- Forceful speech (*tshig rnams shugs byung smra ba*) or the ability to mirror others' speech patterns (*gcig gis gang ltar smras pa ltar*)

These marks indicate a constitution capable of sustaining the energetic transformations of Dzogchen practice, not social status.

[1959-1974] [CONCEPT] Caste Irrelevance in Dzogchen Transmission
**Analysis:** When the above qualities are complete (*de rnams gcig la tshang ba na*), social origin becomes irrelevant. Longchenpa lists the lowest castes:
- Butcher caste (*shan pa'i rigs*)
- Prostitute caste (*smad 'tshong rigs*)
- Chāṇḍāla/untouchable caste (*phyags dar khrod pa'i rigs*)
- Any low caste (*rigs ngan gang dag*)

The secret instruction essence (*gsang ba'i man ngag bcud*) is given regardless. The phrase *rgyu chung* (small cause) indicates the practitioner brings minimal resources—using only their own provisions (*rang gi yo byad*) and giving completely without remainder (*lhag ma med par yongs su sbyin*).

The lineage (*rigs*) and color examination methods (*kha dog brtag thabs*) are part of the esoteric transmission. Longchenpa notes that after his parinirvāṇa (*mya ngan 'das 'og tu*), this secret instruction essence (*yang bcud*) will be taught to the definitive king (*nges pa'i rgyal po*)—the qualified practitioner.

[1975-1990] [STRUCTURE] Two Modes of Practice
**Analysis:** The text transitions to the second topic (*don gnyis pa*): how to practice experientially. Two modes (*bsgrub lugs gnyis*):

1. **Wandering Yogi Style** (*sprang po'i tshul*): Abandon own locale, go to other regions. Make it so that no one knows your name, good or bad, what you know or don't know. Pretend to be ordinary. Live by begging for food and clothes. Dwell in caves, villages, secluded places, or inns without obvious signs.

During this time:
- Not boasting of one's qualities (*rang gi yon tan ming ngom pa med*) = mark of few desires (*zhe 'dod med pa'i rtags*)
- Not hinting at others' gurus or dharmas (*gzhan gyi bla ma dang chos la dri brda mi byed*) = mark of confidence and doubtlessness in one's own instructions (*rang gi man ngag la yid ches shing the tshom med pa'i rtags*)

The phrase *de skad du yang* (thus it is said) introduces further scriptural citation.
