[4632-4638] [STRUCTURE] Mind Pith and Three Piths Summary
**Analysis:** The section transitions to the third of the three piths (*gnad gsum*): mind (*sems*). The structure follows a pattern of scriptural citation, explanation, summary verse:
1. Citation from *Thal 'gyur* (4632-4633): Body, speech, and mind bound
2. Citation from tantra (4636-4638): Knowing and relying on the three piths liberates from samsara
3. Transition to second main topic (*don gnyis pa*) at 4639

The term *don gnyis pa* (second meaning/topic) marks a major structural division, indicating the text moves from general introduction of the three piths to specific applications.

[4639-4651] [PHILOLOGY] Technical Terminology of Direct Introduction
**Analysis:** The phrase *mngon sum rang thog tu dbab pa* (delivering direct to self-point) at 4639 uses *thog* (point/vertex) in a technical Dzogchen sense meaning direct, unmediated recognition. The term *rdz rje'i chings* (vajra binding) at 4640 suggests indestructible constraint—binding the three piths so they become inseparable from practice. The metaphorical triad at 4658-4660 employs folk terminology:
- *Sos* (sling/snare) for gate-pith: captures (*zin*) non-changing
- *'Gron po* (traveler/messenger) for field-pith: creates unavoidable encounter
- *Jag* (thief/bandit) for wind-awareness-pith: seizes (*tshud*) the mark-measure

The particle *'dra* (like/similar) in each line establishes simile as the primary mode of explanation.

[4646-4663] [CONTEXT] Source Citations and Comparative Doctrines
**Analysis:** The citation at 4646-4651 from *Thal 'gyur* establishes the three piths (*gnad gsum*) as: gate (*sgo*), field (*yul*), and wind-awareness (*rlung rig*). This formulation appears in Nyingma *Thalgyur* texts but differs from Sarma (New Translation) formulations that typically emphasize channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and drops (*thig le*). The text at 4661-4663 presents the three piths as both sufficient (*gsum du nges*) and necessary—more causes loss (*gnad stor*), less causes incompleteness (*don mi 'grub*). This reflects the "middle way" (*dbu ma*) logic applied to contemplative technique.

[4664-4672] [CONCEPT] Interdependence of the Three Piths
**Analysis:** The section establishes logical dependencies:
1. **Without field** (*yul med na*): No support-base (*rten sa'i gzhi*)
2. **Without gate** (*sgo med na*): Lost path for wandering (*'gro ba'i lam*)
3. **Without wind-awareness** (*rlung rig gi gnad med na*): Awareness doesn't dissolve internally (*shes rig nang du mi chod*)

This creates a functional interdependence: field provides ground, gate provides access, wind-awareness provides dynamic energy. The text at 4669-4672 divides the second topic into: (1) establishing the general sequence (*spyi'i chings*) of the three piths, and (2) delivering to individual piths (*so so'i gnad*). The sequence (*rim pa*) requires body, speech, and mind to be unmoving (*mi 'gul*) while binding gate, field, and wind-awareness—establishing the *gnad gsum* as simultaneous requirements, not sequential stages.
