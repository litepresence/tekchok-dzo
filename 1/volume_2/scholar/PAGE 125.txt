[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the exhaustion of dharmatā (chos nyid zad pa) through comparative metaphor [5398-5401], existential implications [5402-5411], and definitional analysis [5412-5428]. The structure employs analogy (birth-death four), causal reasoning (pas/bas), and enumeration (rim gyis/cig car). The passage concludes with technical definitions distinguishing conditioned vs. unconditioned exhaustion.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5398]: skye rga na 'chi bzhi'i 'phel zad pa (birth-aging-illness-death four's waxing-waning): biological metaphor for cosmic cycles. phyis snod (outer vessel/container): inanimate environment. nang bcud (inner essence): sentient beings.

Line [5402-5411]: 'khrul pa'i chos (delusion dharmas): phenomena of error. chos nyid don dam (dharmatā ultimate): ultimate truth. chos can dang chos nyid (dharmin and dharmatā): subject and nature distinction.

Line [5412-5418]: kun gzhi'i cha sgo gsum (all-base's three doors): body-speech-mind as expressions of fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa). rtsa ba'i ma rig pa (root ignorance): original non-recognition.

Line [5424-5428]: rim gyis (gradual) vs. cig car (instantaneous): classical distinction in Buddhist praxis. snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa (four visions arriving at measure): completion of visionary path as prerequisite for gradual exhaustion.

[CONTEXT] This passage addresses a critical juncture in Dzogchen theory—the "exhaustion" of phenomena into dharmatā. The distinction between gradual (rim gyis) and instantaneous (cig car) exhaustion reflects broader Tibetan debates about realization modalities. The cosmic metaphor (outer vessel/inner essence) derives from Abhidharma cosmology but reinterpreted through Dzogchen's lens of spontaneous perfection. The critique of denying form-kāya (sku) and wisdom (ye shes) in result-phase reflects Nyingma polemics against nihilistic interpretations of emptiness.

[CONCEPT]
• Exhaustion modalities:
  - Gradual: four visions completed, phenomena gradually dissolve
  - Instantaneous: immediate recognition of dharmatā, simultaneous liberation
  - Supreme intellect instantaneous (blo mchog cig car): special capacity

• Dharmatā exhaustion dimensions:
  - Outer: five-light vision with form-kāya exhausted
  - Inner: subtle body with thought-aggregates exhausted
  - Secret: experience-vision objects exhausted
  - Result: pure-from-beginning vision cloudless sky-like

• Cosmological parallels:
  - Birth-aging-illness-death waxing-waning
  - Outer vessel disintegration
  - Inner essence lifespan limits
  - Three realms non-liberation if incomplete
