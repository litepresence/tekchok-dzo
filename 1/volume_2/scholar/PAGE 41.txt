[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2075-2146]
Page 41 presents the detailed exposition of the third category of conduct: Great Perfection spontaneous accomplishment conduct (rdzogs pa chen po lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa; lines 2087-2096). This section is pivotal as it transitions from the conduct of lower vehicles to the distinctive Atiyoga approach. The page then moves to the second major subdivision: extensive explanation of secret great definite conduct (gsang chen nges pa'i spyod pa rgyas par bshad pa; lines 2097-2146).

This second subdivision bifurcates into:
1. Extensive explanation of the nature of twenty-one conducts (spyod pa nyi shu rtsa gcig gi rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa; lines 2097-2145)
2. Progressive of doing vajra song dance (rdo rje'i glu gar bya ba'i rim pa; line 2099)

The twenty-one conducts section opens with an extensive citation from the Nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud (Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra; lines 2100-2145), presenting eleven animal-based conduct metaphors. The structural progression moves from naturalistic metaphors (bee, deer) through behavioral modifications (mute, madman) to the culmination in fearlessness (lion).

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: lhun gyis grub pa] - Wylie: lhun gyis grub pa. "Spontaneously accomplished" or "naturally perfected." Critical Dzogchen technical term denoting that enlightenment is not produced through effort but naturally present. The term lhun (spontaneously, naturally, effortlessly) distinguishes Dzogchen from all graduated paths requiring deliberate cultivation. Related to the Dzogchen triad: ka dag (primordial purity), lhun grub (spontaneous presence), and thugs rje (compassionate responsiveness).

[TERM: gshis la blang dor 'dzin rtsol med pa] - Wylie: gshis la blang dor 'dzin rtsol med pa. "In the nature (gshis), without acceptance-rejection holding-effort." Complex technical phrase encapsulating the Dzogchen view: the natural state (gshis) is beyond the dualistic activities of accepting (blang) or rejecting (dor), beyond holding ('dzin) or effort (rtsol). This phrase serves as a concise definition of Dzogchen conduct.

[TERM: ye grol ye spyod] - Wylie: ye grol ye spyod. "Primordially liberated, primordial conduct." Technical compound indicating conduct that is not adopted but naturally manifest from the recognition of primordial liberation. The prefix ye- (primordial) negates any notion of temporal development or acquisition.

[TERM: byar med byas med] - Wylie: byar med byas med. "Nothing to do, nothing done." Famous Dzogchen negational formula from the Rang shar (Self-Arisen) citation (lines 2093-2096). This binary negation eliminates both the possibility of action (bya ba) and the completion of action (byas pa), establishing the transcendence of karma and deliberate practice.

[TERM: 'gro med 'ong med gnas pa med] - Wylie: 'gro med 'ong med gnas pa med. "No going, no coming, no abiding." Tripartite negation eliminating the three modes of temporal movement. This formula appears in Prajnaparamita literature and is here integrated into Dzogchen conduct theory to indicate the transcendence of all conventional directional and temporal categories.

[TERM: nyi zla kha sbyor] - Wylie: nyi zla kha sbyor. "Sun-Moon Mouth-Join." Title of a Nyingma tantra in the Anuyoga class. The imagery of sun and moon joining represents the union of method (thabs; male, sun) and wisdom (shes rab; female, moon). The tantra is cited extensively as an authoritative source for conduct instructions.

[ANIMAL CONDUCT TERMS] - The page presents eleven animal-metaphor conducts:
1. Bung ba (bee) - enjoying all dharmas' taste
2. Ri dwags (deer/musk deer) - abandoning delusion conditions
3. Lkugs pa (mute) - abandoning delusion speech
4. Thi bya (peacock) - cutting secret mantra doubt
5. Smyon pa (madman) - abandoning single-dwelling objects
6. Seng ge (lion) - abandoning fear mind, going charnel-ground
7. Khyi phag (dog-pig) - abandoning pure-impure thought
8. Ldom bu (cloud) - experiencing memory thought instant
9. Bu chung (child) - abandoning long delusion clinging
10. Rnga mo (echo) - guiding world-appropriate words
11. Glang chen (elephant) - turning depth samsara battles

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Rang shar (Self-Arisen)] - Lines 2090-2096 cite from the Rang shar, a major Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The citation establishes the four negations defining Dzogchen conduct:
- Byar med (nothing to do)
- Byas med (nothing done) 
- Byung sa med (no arising ground)
- 'Gro med (no going)
- 'Ong med (no coming)
- Gnas pa med (no abiding)
- Chags pa med (no attachment)
- Zhen pa med (no clinging)

This eightfold negation encapsulates the Dzogchen transcendence of all dualistic categories of action and location.

[CITATION: Nyi zla kha sbyor gyi rgyud] - The Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra provides the primary scriptural source for the twenty-one conducts. The citation structure (lines 2100-2145) presents a systematic typology of conduct metaphors, each pairing an animal with a specific behavioral modification and spiritual benefit. This reflects the tantric pedagogical method of using accessible natural imagery to point to subtle internal transformations.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Atiyoga Conduct Distinction] - The page explicitly contrasts Atiyoga conduct with lower vehicles (lines 2087-2096). The characteristic vehicle conducts operate through acceptance-rejection ('dzin rtsol); the mantra general conducts operate through method with effort (thabs yod kyang rtsol sgrub); the Atiyoga conduct operates through accordance with the natural state itself (gshis la... de nyid dang mthun par). This triadic structure reflects the standard Nyingma vehicle classification.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Animal Metaphor System] - The twenty-one conducts employ zoomorphic metaphors that function on multiple levels:

1. NATURALISTIC LEVEL: Each animal represents specific behavioral characteristics observable in nature (bees gathering nectar, deer fleeing hunters, lions fearless).

2. PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL: The animal behaviors map onto mental states (bee = enjoyment, deer = avoidance of samsara, mute = silence, madman = spontaneity).

3. TRANSFORMATIVE LEVEL: Each metaphor indicates a specific transformation: enjoyment without clinging (bee), abandonment of conditions (deer), cutting conceptual proliferation (mute), transcending social convention (madman), fearlessness (lion).

4. HIERARCHICAL LEVEL: The sequence progresses from naturalistic behaviors (bee, deer) through social transgression (madman) to the culmination of mastery (lion).

[ANALYSIS: Peacock Conduct] - The thi bya (peacock) conduct (line 2107-2108) exemplifies the tantric principle of transformation: "by peacock like conduct, cut secret mantra doubt." The peacock in Indian symbolism consumes poison and transforms it into beautiful plumage. This represents the advanced tantric capacity to transform afflictions (nyon mongs) into wisdom without rejection.

[ANALYSIS: Madman Conduct] - The smyon pa (madman) conduct (lines 2109-2110) represents the transgressive aspect of tantric practice: "abandon one-dwelling objects." This indicates transcendence of fixed abode, social convention, and predictable behavior patterns. In Tibetan religious history, the "holy madman" (smyon pa) tradition represents the visible manifestation of this principle.

[ANALYSIS: Dog-Pig Conduct] - The khyi phag (dog-pig) conduct (lines 2113-2114) addresses the pure-impure dichotomy: "abandon pure impure thought." Dogs and pigs in traditional South Asian culture represent the lowest, most impure animals. By emulating their disregard for purity distinctions, the practitioner transcends the attachment to ritual purity that characterizes lower vehicles.

[ANALYSIS: Conduct Typology Structure] - The twenty-one conducts are organized into functional groups:
- SENSORY TRANSFORMATION: bee (taste), echo (sound)
- AVOIDANCE/SOLITUDE: deer, mute, child
- TRANSCENDENCE OF DICHOTOMIES: peacock (poison/wisdom), dog-pig (pure/impure), madman (convention/spontaneity)
- POWER/MASTERY: lion (fearlessness), elephant (samsara battles), mountain (unchanging)

This systematic organization reflects the comprehensive nature of Nyingma conduct theory, addressing every aspect of human experience and spiritual development.
