[13054-13056] [STRUCTURE] ## Three Kayas Path Presentation
**Analysis:** This section transitions to the *sku gsum gyi lam* (path of the three kayas), a distinctive Nyingma framework that maps the bardo journey onto the three-body doctrine: dharmakaya realization in the chikhai bardo, sambhogakaya visions in the chonyid bardo, and nirmanakaya rebirth choices.

[13057-13058] [CONTEXT] Self-Arisen Tantra Quotation
**Analysis:** The opening *rang shar las/* marks a direct citation from the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra, a key *Atiyoga* text. The vocative *ho* and honorific address to the "Awareness power-of king" (*rig pa dbang gi rgyal po*) indicate tantric revelation speech.

[13062-13084] [CONCEPT] The Five Buddha Field Navigation System
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents a systematic directional mapping of the five Buddha families:
- East: Vajrasattva in Manifest Joy (*mngon par dga' ba*)
- South: Ratnasambhava in Glory-possess (*dpal dang ldan pa*)
- West: Amitayus (Light-endless) in Lotus-pile (*pad ma brtsegs*)
- North: Amoghasiddhi (Meaningful-accomplishment) in karma-perfected pure-land
- Northeast: Vajrapani (Glory Hand-vajra) in Power-perfectly-display

[13064-13084] [PHILOLOGY] Imperative Constructions
**Analysis:** The repeated use of imperative forms: *thos* (listen!), *chos ston* (teach dharma!), *mi 'jigs* (fear not!), *phyin* (proceed!)—creates an urgent, directive tone characteristic of bardo instruction manuals.

[13065-13083] [CONCEPT] Outer-Inner Superimposition Cutting
**Analysis:** The phrase *phyi nang gi spros pa gcod* (cut outer-inner superimposition) refers to the fundamental Dzogchen practice of cutting through dualistic conceptual elaboration regarding external objects and internal mind. This is prerequisite for entering the primordial pure pure-lands.
