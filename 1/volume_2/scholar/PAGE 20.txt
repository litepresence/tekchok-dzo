[1036-1041] [CONTEXT] Characteristics of Nirmanakaya
**Analysis:** The characteristics are "performing the completion of the two benefits for disciples" (*gdul bya'i don gnyis rdzogs par byed pa*). The *de nyid las* citation states:
- "Performing the completion of actions" (*bya ba rdzogs par bya ba byed*)
- "Considered in two aspects" (*rnam pa gnyis su 'dod pa*)

This bifurcation anticipates the two types of nirmanakaya that follow.

[1042-1045] [STRUCTURE] Two Divisions of Nirmanakaya
**Analysis:** While generally there are multiple divisions (nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, etc.), "on this occasion" (*skabs 'dir*) Longchenpa focuses on two types based on "completion of the two benefits" (*don gnyis rdzogs par grub pa*):
1. **Emanation-kaya of completed actions** (*bya ba rdzogs pa'i sprul sku*) - self-benefit
2. **Emanation-kaya of performing actions** (*bya ba byed pa'i sprul sku*) - other-benefit

[1046-1051] [CONCEPT] Emanation-Kaya of Completed Actions
**Analysis:** This is "self-benefit spontaneously established" (*rang don lhun gyis grub pa*). The process unfolds:

**Temporal Locus:** In this life or intermediate state (*tshe 'di'am bar dor*)
**Gateway:** Completing the gate of spontaneously accomplished self-appearance (*rang snang lhun grub kyi sgo rdzogs*)
**Activity:** Through the "three connections" (*sbyor ba gsum*), benefit is performed for those arising as self-appearance of the six realms from the gate of impurity (*ma dag pa'i sgo*)
**Result:** Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying (*dong sprugs*) the six families (*rigs drug*), the expanse becomes peaceful

The logic: "The self-appearance of samsara must be emptied, for delusion-appearance must be emptied" (*rang snang gi 'khor ba stongs dgos te / 'khrul snang stong dgos pa'i phyir ro*).

[1052-1055] [CONTEXT] Common Buddhist Prayers
**Analysis:** Longchenpa cites common aspirations:
- "May the three lower realms of samsara be exhausted and emptied" (*zad cing stongs par gyur cig 'khor ba ngan song gsum*)
- The bodhisattva vow to liberate all beings (*sems can thams cad grol bar sems bskyed pa*)

This connects Dzogchen theory to mainstream Mahayana practice.

[1056-1062] [CONCEPT] Intermediate State Emanations
**Analysis:** A crucial passage on the intermediate state (*bar do*):

**Conditional Capacity:** Whether able or unable to release emanations in the bardo
**Process:** When stations of the six realms appear below (*mar*) in the gate of spontaneously accomplished self-appearance
**Activity:** Teaching Dharma to that "self-appearance of emptiness appearing as self-appearance" (*rang snang gi stong pa rang snang ba*)
**Causal Efficacy:** By this cause, all samsaric appearances become empty
**Final Dissolution:** When dissolving into the expanse of pure nirvana through the gate of spontaneous accomplishment, this is called "Buddha entering nirvana" (*sangs rgyas mya ngan las 'das pa*)

**Critical Note:** Line 1062 emphasizes this is "of crucial importance to all who possess wisdom" (*'di shes rab yod pa kun la gnad gal po che'o*), flagging this as a key hermeneutical point.

[1063] [PHILOLOGY] Definition Refinement
**Analysis:** "That appearance in emptiness for establishing self-benefit, being an emanation arisen from oneself that liberates oneself into the expanse, is called the emanation-kaya of completed actions" (*rang don bsgrub pa'i stong par snang ba de ni rang nyid dbyings su grol byed rang las shar ba'i sprul pa yin pas bya ba rdzogs pa'i sprul sku zhes bya*).

This emphasizes the reflexive nature (*rang*) of this kaya: self-arisen, self-liberating.

[1064-1070] [CONTEXT] Citation from Self-Arisen
**Analysis:** The *rang shar* citation on the emanation-kaya of completed actions:
1. "Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened" (*rang gi rgyud 'grol mngon sangs rgyas*)
2. "From that, distributing emanations" (*de nas sprul pa 'gyed pa*)
3. "Outer and inner actions complete" (*phyi nang bya ba rdzogs pa*)
4. "Considered as the emanation-kaya of completed actions" (*bya ba rdzogs pa'i sprul skur 'dod*)

[1071] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Distribution of Emanations
**Analysis:** "The manner of distributing emanations" (*sprul pa 'gyed lugs ni*)—preparing to explain how nirmanakaya activity radiates into the world.
