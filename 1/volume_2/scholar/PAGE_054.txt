[2631-2637] [CONTEXT] Self-Arisen Citation on Deva-Human Mind-Holding
**Analysis:** The citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen Tantra) at lines 2631-2636 establishes the criteria for authentic mind-holding (*sems 'dzin*): (1) restraint of nose-breath (*khna'i dbugs bsdams*), (2) non-wavering non-thought (*rtog med yid ma 'gyus*), (3) single-pointed knowing (*shes pa rtse gcig*). The phrase *yang dag don chen mtshon mi nus* (cannot indicate the ultimate great meaning) introduces the fundamental Dzogchen distinction between *rtogs pa* (realization) and *sgom pa* (meditation)—the latter being a preparation that cannot directly manifest ultimate truth.

[2638-2652] [STRUCTURE] Bodhisattva Samadhi Bifurcation
**Analysis:** The text at lines 2638-2652 presents a bipartite structure (*gnyis*) for bodhisattva samadhi: (1) the classification proper (*dbye ba dngos*) and (2) derivative classifications (*zhar las byung ba*). The root verse from *Rang shar* establishes three modes: mental apprehension (*sems kyis 'dzin pa*), spontaneous arising (*ngang ngam shugs kyis skye*), and familiarization becoming expanse (*goms nas klong du gyur*). The final line *des kyang don chen mtshon mi nus* reiterates the limitation of these practices relative to direct recognition.

[2653-2655] [CONCEPT] The Limitation of Samadhi Relative to Rigpa
**Analysis:** Lines 2653-2654 contain a critical Dzogchen doctrinal statement: authentic nature (*gshis kyi don*) is none other than rigpa-clear light (*rig pa 'od gsal*), and merely abiding in non-thought (*rtog med gnas pa tsam*) cannot indicate the great meaning. This reflects the distinction between *sgom* (meditation, with effort) and *chos nyid* (dharmata, effortless). The causal particle *ma yin pa'i phyir* establishes the negative reason: because mere non-thought is not the authentic nature, it cannot manifest the ultimate.

[2656-2672] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Samadhi Classification
**Analysis:** The expanded presentation at lines 2655-2671 delineates three categories of bodhisattva samadhi: (1) spontaneous nature samadhi (*rang bzhin shugs kyi bsam gtan*)—the unconditioned arising of body-speech ease; (2) reference-point supported samadhi (*dmigs pa rgyud rten gyi bsam gtan*)—antidote meditation for afflictions; (3) ground-abiding samadhi (*sa la gnas pa'i bsam gtan*)—the actual samadhi of the grounds purifying one's ground-habits. The Sun-Moon Union citation that follows establishes these as standard Great Vehicle presentations.

[2673-2676] [CONCEPT] Natural vs. Artificial Samadhi
**Analysis:** The final section distinguishes *rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan* (natural samadhi) from *bcos ma'i bsam gtan* (artificial/samadhi). Natural samadhi occurs whenever consciousness (*sems rnam shes*) is distracted (*bag la yengs*)—examples include the distracted mind of an archer (*mda' srong gi mig*) or the dreaming sleep of animals. This indicates that the nature of mind manifests spontaneously without deliberate cultivation. The artificial category encompasses all intentional meditation including non-thought and deity yoga (*bskyed rdzogs*), marked by the instrumental *blos* (by mind/intellect) indicating deliberate agency.
