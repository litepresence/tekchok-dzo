[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the third vision (rig pa tshad phebs) through a bipartite structure: first establishing definition and scriptural citation [5247-5265], then dividing into general explanation and specific three-measure analysis [5266-5281]. The passage employs quotative markers (zhes bya ste, zhes pa) citing canonical sources Thal 'gyur and Bstan bu, followed by enumeration markers (dang po...gnyis pa) for the two-part exposition.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5247-5248]: mu khyud (rim/encirclement) + gtsos 'khor (main retinue): technical terms for mandala architecture. chos sku'i sbyang ba (dharmakāya purification): reference to completion stage processes.

Line [5249-5251]: rig pa tshad phebs (awareness arriving at measure): technical definition—rig pa as ground-abiding awareness made manifest, tshad as measure of full mandala manifestation, phebs as arriving beyond limitation. 'brel tshad (connection measure): karmic linkages that no longer regenerate.

Line [5266-5271]: rang bzhin bye brag tu bshad pa (nature particular explanation): structural marker introducing detailed analysis. gzhi gnas kyi rig pa (ground-abiding awareness): awareness naturally present at the base, now made manifest.

Line [5275-5281]: tshad gsum (three measures): (1) phyis snang (outer vision), (2) nang lus kyi tshad (inner body measure), (3) gsang ba rig pa'i tshad (secret awareness measure). zla ba nya gang ba (full moon): metaphor for complete mandala manifestation.

[CONTEXT] This passage situates within the Thod rgal (Direct Transcendence) completion practice of Dzogchen, specifically the third of four visions. The citations from Thal 'gyur (Thal 'gyur sku gsum 'od kyi snang ba) and Bstan bu (likely Gsang ba snying po) authenticate the visionary taxonomy. The three-measure schema reflects physiological, perceptual, and cognitive dimensions of realization. The emphasis on "beyond limitation" ('das sa med pa) distinguishes Dzogchen's spontaneous approach from gradual path constraints.

[CONCEPT]
• Three measures (tshad gsum) taxonomy:
  - Outer vision measure: perceptual domain transformation
  - Inner body measure: subtle body completion
  - Secret awareness measure: cognitive perfection

• Mandala completion indicators:
  - Five families as father-mother pairs (rigs lnga yab yum)
  - Six, ten, and five-three configurations (drug dang bcu dang lnga gsum)
  - Main-retinue architecture (gtsos 'khor)

• Awareness arriving (rig pa tshad phebs):
  - Ground-abiding awareness made manifest (gzhi gnas rig pa mngon du gyur)
  - Self-resonance display through body-door (sku snang)
  - Path-vision exhaustion (lam snang zad du ne ba)
