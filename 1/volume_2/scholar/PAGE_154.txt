[6522-6527] [STRUCTURE] Breaking the House of Mind: Sixteen Dharmas
**Analysis:** This page synthesizes previous analyses into the "destruction of mind's house" (*sems kyi khang bu bshig pa*). The structure presents four similes (*dpe*) for self-destruction through analysis, culminating in the "fourfold direct introduction" (*ngo sprod pa bzhi*) and sixteen dharmas of non-existence (*med pa'i chos bcu drug*).

[6522] [PHILOLOGY] *Blo bde ba*
**Analysis:** The term *blo bde ba* (mind at ease/peace) marks the soteriological conclusion of analysis. The particle *pas* indicates causal consequence: through cutting (*chod pa*) the misconception of mind's existence, one realizes the non-existence from which no deviation is possible (*ma rtogs pa'i logs pa med*).

[6523-6527] [CONCEPT] Fourfold Direct Introduction
**Analysis:** The four introductions continue from previous page:
4. **Dharmatā Former-Later** [6523-6527]: Introduction between former and later dharmatā reveals mind without birth. Knowing this: propensities (*bag chags*) and body alaya cannot harm. The "house of mind" is like a child's sandcastle—built while dissolving.

[6528-6532] [STRUCTURE] Fruition of Non-Existence
**Analysis:** The conclusion of the four times analysis (*dus bzhi*):
- No buddha exists → buddha is merely name (*ming tsam*)
- Hope for fruition (*'bras bu la re ba*) is reversed (*blo ldog*)
- Therefore no path of effort (*'bad rtsol*)
- Liberation's measure (*grol ba'i tshad*) means not finding anything in existence or non-existence

[6528-6532] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Precision
**Analysis:** Key terms:
- *Sangs rgyas med pas* (because buddha does not exist): ablative *pas* indicating consequence
- *Ming tsam* (mere name): nominalist critique of substantial buddhahood
- *'Khor 'das su btags pa* (designated as samsara/nirvana): the merely nominal status of all dichotomies

[6533-6548] [STRUCTURE] Sixteen Dharmas and Three Results
**Analysis:** The sixteen dharmas (*chos can bcu drug*) break mind's house through four sets of four analyses each, culminating in three results (*'bras bu gsum*):

1. **Appearance-mind nondual without fixation** (*bem rig gnyis med*) [6571]
2. **Mind's house self-destructed, movement-thoughts cleared** (*'gyu ba rtogs sangs*) [6573]
3. **Knowing the dissolution place** (*yal sa*) of nondual matter-awareness [6574]

[6536-6548] [CONCEPT] Four Similes of Destruction
**Analysis:** The destruction of mind's house (*sems kyi khang bu bshig pa*) employs four similes:

1. **Child's sandcastle** (*byis pa'i khang bu*) [6538]: Built while collapsing—illusory construction
2. **Iron destroyed by iron** (*lcags kyis lcags 'jig*) [6539]: Mind analyzes mind into non-existence
3. **Impermanent destroyed by impermanent** (*mi rtag pas mi rtag pa 'jig*) [6540-6542]:
   - Illusory person destroys illusory city (*sgyu ma'i mi sgru ma'i grong khyer bcom*)
   - Compounded destroyed by compounded (*byas pas mi rtag pa 'jig*) like corpses heaped (*ro la ro brtsegs*)
   - Awareness destroys previous unawareness (*rig pa da ltar bas ma rig pa sna ma 'jig*)

[6543-6546] [CONTEXT] Scriptural Analogies
**Analysis:** The similes draw on:
- *Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra*: illusory city and illusory beings
- *Prajñāpāramitā*: dream and magical display analogies
- *Cintāmaṇi* (wish-fulfilling jewel) [6544]: Like a poor person searching in a poor house, there is no finding-place (*rnyed pa'i gnas med*)
- Letters on water (*chu la yi ge bris pa*) [6543]: Mind's traces dissolve without residue

[6547-6548] [PHILOLOGY] *Sems med pa'i don*
**Analysis:** The phrase *sems med pa'i don ma shes par* (without understanding the meaning of mind's non-existence) sets up the critique: those who seek through view, meditation, and conduct (*lta sgom spyod pa*) while searching in mind are like those grasping at water when waves subside (*rdib pa'i tshe chu la 'dzin pa*)—there is no place to grasp.
