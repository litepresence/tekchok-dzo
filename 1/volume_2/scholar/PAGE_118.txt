[STRUCTURE] This page continues the phenomenology of vision experience (snang ba'i nyams), shifting from general characteristics to specific manifestations. The passage employs spatial metaphors (palace, expanse, mansion) and technical terminology for the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) schema. Structural markers include demonstrative deictics (de, des na) linking visionary phenomena to their ground.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5112-5115]: ye bzhugs (original abiding): technical term for primordial non-constructed presence. lhun grub chen po (great spontaneous completion): highest classification of manifestation. 'pho 'gyur med pa (not-existing change): immutability of awareness-display.

Line [5116-5120]: snang ba bzhi (four visions): core Tögal taxonomy—(1) chos nyid snang ba (dharmatā vision), (2) nyams gong 'phel (increasing experience), (3) rig pa tshad phebs (awareness reaching full measure), (4) chos zad pa (exhaustion of phenomena). thod rgal (direct transcendence): the path using these visions.

Line [5121-5125]: 'ja' lus (rainbow body): manifestation of realization as light-form. sku gsum (three kāyas): dharmakāya (chos sku), sambhogakāya (longs sku), nirmāṇakāya (sprul sku). rig 'dzin (vidyādhara): awareness-holder, five types enumerated.

[CONTEXT] This material situates within the "four visions" (snang ba bzhi) framework of the Tögal path, the result vehicle (Dzogchen) completion practice. The technical terms derive from the Bla ma yang thig, Mthong ba don ldan, and other seminal Dzogchen tantras. The passage represents Longchenpa's systematic presentation of the stageless stages—though Dzogchen transcends gradualism, the four visions provide a descriptive framework for recognition. The "original abiding" (ye bzhugs) terminology distinguishes this from constructed meditation states (bcos ma).

[CONCEPT]
• Four visions taxonomy:
  - Dharmatā vision (chos nyid snang ba): direct manifestation of nature-of-things
  - Increasing experience (nyams gong 'phel): visions multiply and intensify
  - Awareness reaching full measure (rig pa tshad phebs): complete recognition
  - Exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad pa): phenomena liberated into their ground

• Spatial metaphors:
  - Self-light expanse (rang 'od kyi klong): dimension of natural luminosity
  - Wisdom palace (ye shes kyi pho brang): residence of primordial knowing
  - Great spontaneous completion (lhun grub chen po): uncontrived perfection

• Teleology:
  - Three kāyas actualization through vision practice
  - Five vidyādhara attainments
  - Rainbow body ('ja' lus) as somatic marker of realization
