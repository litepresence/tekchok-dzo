[11168-11181] [CONTEXT] Citation from Tantric Source
**Analysis:** Lines 11169-11180 present a verse citation describing the qualities of the realized person (*rtogs pa'i skyes bu*). The citation emphasizes:
- Inconceivable qualities beyond existence and non-existence (*yod med yon tan bsam mi khyab*)
- Self-illuminating wisdom dwelling as unity (*gcig par gnas pa'i ye shes*)
- Self-displaying great display without arrangement (*ma bkod ye gdangs*)
- Natural presence of method and wisdom (*thabs dang shes rab rang bzhin las*)
- Two buddha-families appearing (*sangs rgyas rigs kyang gnyis su snang*)
- All appearing as retinue (*'di kun de yi 'khor du snang*)
- Appearance from base-appearance without nature (*gzhi snang rang bzhin med pa las*)
- Inexpressible dharma beyond thought and speech (*smra bsam brjod med chos*)
- Three times equally self-abiding from the beginning (*dus gsum mnyam pa nyid...ye nas...rang gnas*)

[11168] [PHILOLOGY] Citation Marker: *De nyid las*
**Analysis:** *De nyid las* (from that very [source]) indicates continuation from the same tantric source as the previous citation.

[11182-11194] [CONCEPT] Three Combinations of Signs
**Analysis:** The text analyzes liberation based on combinations of three signs (*rtags*):

1. **Body sign complete** (*lus rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo (*bar dor grol*)
2. **Body and speech signs present** (*lus dang ngag gnyis...yod pa*): liberation in Nirmanakaya realm (*sprul pa'i zhing du grol*)
3. **Mind sign complete** (*sems rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo in three instants (*bar do la skad cig gsum gyis grol*)
4. **All three complete** (*gsum ka rdzogs na*): engaging in other-benefit compassion (*snying rje gzhan don byed*)

[11188-11191] [CONCEPT] Fruitional Dimensions
**Analysis:** When all three signs are complete:
- Knowledge of certain self-attainment (*rang don thob nges su shes pas*)
- Blessing for measureless lives (*tshe grangs med par byin gyis brlabs*)
- Benefit accomplished for beings
- Liberation as light into the very basis
- With body and mind signs: swift self-attainment and liberation

[11192-11194] [CONCEPT] Specific Timeframes
**Analysis:**
- Speech and mind signs combined (*ngag dang sems kyi rtags 'dzom pa*): light-body attained in ten years (*lo bcu na 'od lus thob*)
- All three signs combined (*lus ngag yid gsum gyi rtags 'dzom pa*): even those without other-benefit capacity liberated in two years (*lo gnyis na grol*)

[11195-11231] [CONTEXT] Extensive Citation on Sign Combinations
**Analysis:** This long citation from *De nyid* (Thatness) tantra elaborates:
- Lines 11197-11199: Body sign complete leads to seeing reality in bardo and awakening
- Lines 11200-11202: Body and speech signs lead to one-birth awakening in Nirmanakaya realm
- Lines 11203-11209: Mind sign complete enables three-instant liberation like a shooting star
- Lines 11210-11218: All three signs combined leads to great bodhicitta, benefiting beings for eons with one human body
- Lines 11219-11224: Body and mind signs combined leads to liberation in ten years, elements dissolving into pure reality
- Lines 11225-11231: All three signs combined for fortunate being leads to liberation in two years without doubt

[11195] [PHILOLOGY] Citation Formula: *De nyid las*
**Analysis:** Marks transition to extended tantric citation.

[11232] [STRUCTURE] Critical Distinction: Incomplete Signs
**Analysis:** Line 11232 introduces a crucial caveat: without distinctive outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags khyad par can*), merely possessing some signs (*rtags 'ga' tsam*) creates uncertain signs (*ma nges pa'i rtags*), not liberation.

[11232] [PHILOLOGY] Negative Particle Chain
**Analysis:** The construction *med par...yod kyang...ma nges pa* establishes the contrast between presence and certainty.
