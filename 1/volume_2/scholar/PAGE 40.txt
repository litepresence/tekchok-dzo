[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2051-2074]
Page 40 presents the detailed exposition of conduct-progressive-yogin (spyod pa la rgyun du byed pa'i rnal 'byor), the first of the four categories established in the previous page. The structural organization follows a fourfold division (lines 2051-2055):

1. Appearance-power-transform conduct (snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa)
2. Instruction: appearance direct-placement method (de'i man ngag snang ba cer bzhag gi thabs)
3. Ground-rise intention of appearance-existence (de las snang srid gzhi bzhengs kyi dgongs pa)
4. Fruit of affliction-ground-transformation (nyon mongs pa gnas bsgyur gyi 'bras bu)

This tetrad reflects the standard Tibetan Buddhist pedagogical structure: ground (gzhi), path (lam), and fruit ('bras bu), with the "instruction" (man ngag) serving as the essential method connecting ground and fruit.

The page opens with an extensive citation from the Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud (Jewel-Heap Tantra; lines 2029-2050), comprising twenty-two verses that establish the theoretical foundation for conduct practice. This is followed by the threefold subdivision of the first topic (lines 2056-2064).

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: snang ba] - Wylie: snang ba. Primary Dzogchen technical term denoting "appearance" or "manifestation." In contrast to the Sarma schools' emphasis on emptiness (stong pa nyid), Nyingma Dzogchen privileges appearance as the self-display of awareness (rig pa). The term appears in compound forms: snang srid (appearance-existence), snang ba dbang bsgyur (appearance power-transform).

[TERM: cer bzhag] - Wylie: cer bzhag. Critical Dzogchen technical term variously translated as "direct placement," "naked placement," or "immediate resting." The first syllable cer (naked, direct, immediate) emphasizes non-artificiality. The second syllable bzhag (to place, set, establish) denotes the method of allowing awareness to rest in its natural state without modification. This term distinguishes Dzogchen meditation from structured tantric visualization practices.

[TERM: gzhi bzhengs] - Wylie: gzhi bzhengs. Compound meaning "ground-rise" or "basis-establishment." Technical term in Dzogchen cosmology and epistemology denoting how the ground (gzhi) manifests as the various appearances of samsara and nirvana. The verb bzhengs (to rise, to emerge) implies spontaneous emergence rather than causal production.

[TERM: gnas bsgyur] - Wylie: gnas bsgyur. Compound technical term meaning "ground-transformation" or "basis-transformation." In Dzogchen, this refers to the alchemical process whereby the basis (gnas; Skt. ashraya) of delusion—afflictions and conceptual mind—is transformed into wisdom. Distinct from the Sarma concept of "path purification," Dzogchen emphasizes the transformation of the basis itself.

[TERM: khrigs chags] - Wylie: khrigs chags. Compound meaning "orderly arrangement" or "systematic structure." In the citation from the Jewel-Heap Tantra (line 2031), this refers to the systematic approach to experience-taking. The term carries connotations of proper ordering and methodical progression.

[TERM: spyod pa spyi'i ngo bo] - Wylie: spyod pa spyi'i ngo bo. "General essence of conduct." Technical doxographical phrase indicating the presentation of conduct from the perspective of all vehicles (theg pa), establishing common features before differentiating specific approaches. This reflects the standard Tibetan hermeneutical method of moving from the general (spyi) to the specific (bye brag).

[TERM: gsang chen] - Wylie: gsang chen. "Great Secret." Standard designation for the Vajrayana, particularly the higher tantras. In Nyingma classification, this refers specifically to Mahayoga and Anuyoga, as distinct from Atiyoga (Dzogchen).

[PARTICLE ANALYSIS: gi/gyi] - The instrumental/genitive particle appears in various forms: gyi (after final -g), gyis (instrumental), kyi (after final -g, -ng). In line 2052: snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa—here gyi functions as a genitive linking "appearance-power-transform" to "conduct."

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud] - The Jewel-Heap Tantra citation (lines 2029-2050) presents a comprehensive outline of the conduct system:
- Progressive distinction (de rim bye brag)
- Four owners' manner (bdag po bzhi yi tshul)
- Four meaning essences (don gyi ngo bo bzhi)
- Four domain knowledges (yul rig rnam bzhi)
- Cutting the birth-continuum of appearances (snang ba'i skye rgyun gcod)
- Four placement methods (bzhag thabs man ngag rnam bzhi)
- Self-release of appearance-existence dharmas (snang srid chos rnams rang phyen bya)
- Four pure manner liberation piths (dag lugs grol ba'i gnad bzhi)
- Self-power transformation of afflictions (nyon mongs rnams la rang dbang bsgyur)

This elaborate structure demonstrates the systematic nature of Nyingma conduct theory. The twenty enumerated meanings (don nyi shu) mentioned in line 2028 receive detailed treatment in subsequent pages.

[CITATION: Rang shar] - "From Self-Arisen" (rang shar las)—the citation in lines 2067-2072 references a Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The quoted passage distinguishes characteristic vehicle conduct from the conduct of the Great Perfection: "Not-attach hold conduct is characteristic vehicle conduct, great attach meaning bind, method not liberate how become." This establishes the critique of sutra-based gradualism from the Dzogchen perspective.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Three Vehicle Classification] - The page presents a tri-level doxographical hierarchy:
1. Characteristic Vehicle (mtshan nyid kyi theg pa) - Sutra-based gradual conduct
2. Mantra General (gsang sngags spyi'i spyod pa) - Outer/inner tantric conduct
3. Great Perfection Spontaneous Accomplishment (rdzogs pa chen po lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa) - Atiyoga conduct

This threefold structure appears across Nyingma literature as the standard vehicle (theg pa) classification within the outer/inner division of the dharma.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Three Conduct Categories] - Lines 2061-2063 establish the typology of conduct:
1. Ma chags 'dzin pa'i spyod pa - Not-attach hold conduct: conduct without fixation or grasping
2. Dgag sgrub med pa'i spyod pa - Negate-affirm not conduct: conduct without rejection or acceptance
3. Chags la zhen med kyi spyod pa - Attach not-cling conduct: conduct with engagement but without attachment

This tripartite classification reflects the Dzogchen integration of engagement (not withdrawal) with non-attachment. The first category represents basic non-fixation; the second represents transcending the duality of acceptance/rejection; the third represents the highest level of engaged non-attachment.

[ANALYSIS: Progressive Conduct Framework] - The page establishes a comprehensive framework linking conduct (spyod pa), instruction (man ngag), intention (dgongs pa), and fruit ('bras bu). This represents the Nyingma understanding that conduct is not merely behavioral ethics but a complete transformative system:

Conduct establishes the behavioral foundation → Instruction provides the method → Intention reveals the aim → Fruit actualizes the transformation

This framework distinguishes Nyingma conduct theory from both sutra-based ethics (which lacks tantric method) and Sarma tantra (which emphasizes deity yoga over appearance transformation).

[ANALYSIS: The Four Owners] - The Jewel-Heap citation references "four owners" (bdag po bzhi). In Nyingma doxography, these typically correspond to:
1. The deity (lha) or yidam as the owner of enlightened appearance
2. The guru (bla ma) as the owner of transmission
3. The dakini (mkha' 'gro ma) as the owner of activity
4. The dharma protector (chos skyong) as the owner of obstacles

However, the specific identification of the four owners in this context requires examination of the full Jewel-Heap commentary tradition.

[ANALYSIS: Self-Power Transformation] - The phrase rang dbang bsgyur (self-power transform) in line 2039 indicates that the transformation of afflictions occurs through the yogin's own capacity rather than through external intervention. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on self-liberation (rang grol) as opposed to liberation dependent on external conditions.

The page establishes that authentic conduct in the Great Perfection requires: (1) suitable ground (gnas), (2) proper method (thabs), (3) continuous practice (rgyun du byed pa), and (4) recognition of the fourfold result ('bras bu). This systematic presentation provides the foundation for the detailed conduct instructions that follow.
