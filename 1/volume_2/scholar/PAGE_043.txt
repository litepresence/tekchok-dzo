[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2169-2214]
Page 43 provides the detailed technical exposition of vajra song and dance actual (glu gar dngos), organized according to the threefold structure of body (lus), mind (sems), and speech (ngag; lines 2178-2180). This follows the standard tantric tripartite analysis of all practice activities. The body ritual subdivision (lus kyi cho ga) further bifurcates into attire (chas) and dance (bro gar; line 2181-2182), demonstrating the systematic organization of ritual performance theory.

The page presents two primary ritual contexts:
1. Accumulation-mandala-enter samadhi spread time (tshogs dang dkyil 'khor la 'jug pa dang ting nge 'dzin spel dus; lines 2182-2183)
2. Samsara-nirvana boundary divide time ('khor 'das ru shan 'byed pa'i tshe; line 2195)

The first context involves formal peaceful-wrathful deity practice; the second involves the transgressive naked conduct at the boundary between cyclic existence and liberation. This dual presentation reflects the integration of conventional tantric ritual with the advanced Dzogchen conduct of boundary-transcendence.

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: cho ga] - Wylie: cho ga. "Ritual" or "ceremony." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit vidhi. In tantric contexts, cho ga denotes the formal procedural structure of ritual activities. The phrase lus kyi cho ga (body ritual) indicates the somatic dimension of vajra song practice.

[TERM: chas] - Wylie: chas. "Attire," "costume," or "ornamentation." Technical term for ritual dress and adornment. Distinguished from ordinary clothing (gos), chas indicates the transformative symbolic garment that supports deity yoga practice. The peaceful attire (zhi ba'i chas) and wrathful attire (khro bo'i chas) represent the two primary soteriological modalities in tantric Buddhism.

[TERM: bro gar] - Wylie: bro gar. "Dance." The performative dimension of vajra song. The term bro indicates dance as movement, while gar (Skt. nata) suggests artistic performance. Combined, these denote the choreographed movement accompanying tantric vocalization.

[TERM: lhab lhub] - Wylie: lhab lhub. Onomatopoetic term describing the fluttering movement of silk garments. This vivid descriptive term indicates the flowing quality of peaceful deity attire.

[TERM: dbu rgyan] - Wylie: dbu rgyan. "Crown ornament." The specific head adornment worn by peaceful deities, distinct from the wrathful bone ornaments. The crown represents the five buddha families and the transmutation of the five poisons.

[TERM: rus pa'i rgyan drug] - Wylie: rus pa'i rgyan drug. "Six bone ornaments." The standard set of wrathful attire: crown, earrings, necklace, bracelets, girdle, and ash-application. These represent the six paramitas and the transcendence of ordinary aesthetics.

[TERM: thal chen] - Wylie: thal chen. "Great ash." The sacred ash applied to the body in wrathful deity practice, symbolizing the burning of defilements and the transcendence of purity/impurity dichotomies.

[TERM: bhan+d+ha] - Wylie: bhan+d+ha. Sanskrit loanword (bandha) meaning "bond" or "seal." In wrathful attire, this refers to specific binding ornaments or markings.

[TERM: phur pa] - Wylie: phur pa. "Peg" or "dagger." The ritual phurba used in wrathful practice to subvert obstacles. Holding the phurpa (phur pa 'dzin pa) indicates the activation of wrathful power.

[TERM: phyag rgya] - Wylie: phyag rgya. "Mudra" or "seal." The standard Tibetan translation of Sanskrit mudra. In the context of deity dance (bro gar gyi lha'i phyag rgya), this refers to the ritual hand gestures that accompany and seal the practice.

[TERM: sngags dang snying po] - Wylie: sngags dang snying po. "Mantra and essence." The dual object of speech practice—mantra (sngags; Skt. mantra) and essence/syllable (snying po; Skt. hrdaya). This represents the outer mantra recitation and inner essential practice.

[TERM: gcer bu tha mal du gnas pa] - Wylie: gcer bu tha mal du gnas pa. "Dwell naked ordinary." Technical phrase describing the advanced conduct of transcending all conventions, including clothing. The term gcer bu (naked) indicates complete vulnerability and openness; tha mal (ordinary) indicates non-contrivance.

[TERM: DA ma ru] - Wylie: DA ma ru. "Damaru." The skull-drum used in tantric practice, typically made from two skull caps joined together. The damaru represents the union of method and wisdom and the sound of emptiness.

[TERM: gling bu] - Wylie: gling bu. "Flute." The thigh-bone trumpet used in wrathful practice. The gling bu produces a piercing sound that summons dakinis and dispels obstacles.

[CONTEXT]
[RITUAL CONTEXT: Peaceful-Wrathful Attire] - The page presents detailed specifications for peaceful (zhi ba) and wrathful (khro bo) attire. This dual classification reflects the fundamental tantric doctrine that enlightenment manifests through both peaceful and wrathful modalities. The peaceful attire (lines 2184-2186) includes:
- Silk garments (dar)
- Jewel ornaments (rin po che'i rgyan chas)
- Fluttering cloth (gos kyi lhab lhub)
- Peaceful crown ornament (zhi ba'i dbu rgyan)
- Vajra and bell (rdo rje dril bu)

The wrathful attire (lines 2187-2191) includes:
- Six bone ornaments (rus pa'i rgyan drug)
- Great ash application (thal chen gyi byug pa)
- Corpse paint (zhag gi zo ris)
- Bandha (bhan+d+ha)
- Phurpa (phur pa)

This detailed presentation indicates the page's function as practical ritual instruction rather than mere theoretical exposition.

[RITUAL CONTEXT: Forest-Lake-Island Enhancement] - Lines 2199-2206 describe enhanced practice in natural settings (nags dang mtsho gling la sogs par). The yogin employs:
- Damaru, bell, flute (DA ma ru, dril bu, gling bu)
- Flower head ornaments (me tog gi mgo rgyan)
- Deity body meditation (lha'i sku bsgom pa)
- Rigpa introduction training (rig pa'i ngo sprod thog tu sbyang ba)
- Three-fold samadhi spread (gsum spel)

This integration of musical performance, deity yoga, and Dzogchen pointing-out instructions exemplifies the Nyingma synthetic approach to practice.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Body-Speech-Mind Integration] - The page demonstrates the Nyingma integration of the three vajras (rdo rje gsum): body (lus) through dance and attire, speech (ngag) through mantra and melody, mind (sems) through deity meditation and rigpa training. This tripartite structure appears across Buddhist tantra but receives distinctive Dzogchen elaboration in Nyingma sources.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Vajra Song as Skillful Means] - The page presents vajra song as a comprehensive skillful means (thabs) integrating:
1. SOMATIC: Body posture, movement, and attire
2. VOCAL: Mantra recitation, melodic expression, instrumental accompaniment
3. COGNITIVE: Deity visualization, rigpa recognition

This multifaceted approach addresses practitioners at multiple levels of capacity, providing entry points through physical, vocal, or contemplative engagement.

[ANALYSIS: Naked Conduct Significance] - The gcer bu (naked) conduct (line 2196) represents the apex of transgressive practice. By transcending the fundamental human convention of clothing, the practitioner symbolically transcends all dualistic fixations. However, the modifier tha mal (ordinary) is crucial—this is not exhibitionism or shock value, but ordinary, uncontrived naturalness. The naked body is the "ordinary" body, stripped of social signification.

[ANALYSIS: Dance Choreography] - The page describes specific dance movements:
- Right-extend left-raise (g.yas brkyang g.yon bskul)
- Left-extend right-bend (g.yon brkyang g.yas bskum)

These paired oppositional movements represent the integration of dualistic extremes. The choreography is not arbitrary but encodes the tantric principle of non-dual wisdom through physical enactment.

[ANALYSIS: Vocal Technique] - The speech practice (lines 2209-2214) involves:
1. Long and short vowels (dbyangs... ring po dang thung ngu)
2. Consonant letters (gsal byed kyi yi ge)
3. Curved pleasant melodies ('khyog por gdangs snyan po)
4. Nasal pronunciation of seed syllables (sa sna drangs): om, e, hum, he, lye, shag
5. Supreme vajra words (rdo rje'i tshig): e ma ki ri ki ri, mashta ba li ba li

This technical presentation indicates that vajra song is not spontaneous expression but a trained vocal discipline involving precise phonetic, melodic, and energetic elements.
