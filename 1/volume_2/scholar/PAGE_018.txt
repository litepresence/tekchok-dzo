[934-937] [STRUCTURE] Summary of Sambhogakaya's Fivefold Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa synthesizes the preceding fivefold enumerations: "Some are the field, some are the method, some are the appearance, some are wisdom itself—thus Sambhogakaya is explained as one unified essence" (*la la yul / la la thabs / la la snang ba / la la shes rab yin pas longs sku zhes chun gcig tu bshad pa yin*). This indicates that the multiple fivefold categories (fields, bases, paths, etc.) are not separate ontological entities but different aspects of the single sambhogakaya dimension.

[938-943] [PHILOLOGY] Etymology of Sambhogakaya (*longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku*)
**Analysis:** The term is etymologized through five aspects (*lnga'i sgras*):
1. "Complete with qualities" (*yon tan du longs pa*) - possessing all enlightened attributes
2. "Engaging in pure light-clarity" (*'od gsal dag pa la spyod pa*) - activity in the dimension of clear light
3. "Both benefits spontaneously complete" (*don gnyis lhun gyis rdzogs pa*) - benefit for self and other
4. "Wisdom arrived at its full measure" (*ye shes tshad du phyin pa*) - wisdom fully manifest
5. "With marks, signs, and body of radiating light rays" (*mtshan dpe 'od zer snang ba'i sku*) - the major and minor marks

The phrase "the term 'five' denotes" (*lnga'i sgras...brjod*) indicates that the *longs* (complete) in sambhogakaya encompasses these five dimensions.

[944-949] [CONTEXT] Citation on "Complete" (*longs*) - Part 1
**Analysis:** From *rang shar*, the first five aspects of completeness:
1. "Abiding in the state of empty dharmata—complete" (*chos nyid stong pa'i ngang du gnas pas longs*) - the ground of emptiness
2. "Clear, unmixed, pervading all—complete" (*gsal la ma 'dres kun la khyab pas longs*) - luminous unobstructed pervasion
3. "In the five wisdoms, gathering and separating not—complete" (*ye shes lnga la 'du 'bral med par nags pas longs*) - non-dual wisdom
4. "Unequal to all, endowed with individual marks—complete" (*kun dang mi mnyam so so'i mtshan dang ldan pas longs*) - unique characteristics
5. "Method and wisdom, gathering and separating not, abiding—complete" (*thabs dang shes rab 'du 'bral med par gnas pas longs*) - union of upaya and prajna

[950-959] [CONTEXT] Citation on "Engage" (*spyod*) - Part 2
**Analysis:** The "engagement" (*spyod pa*) aspect of sambhogakaya includes ten dimensions (lines 950-959):

**First Set (950-954):**
- Five appearances without marks (*snang ba lnga nyid mtshan ma med par*)
- Without grasping, self-clear, playing in all
- Crystal-clear (*sang nge*), lucid (*sal le*), equally abiding
- Vivid (*lhang nge*), soft (*lhan ne*), distributing emanations
- Intent upon the two kayas

**Second Set (955-959):** [Repeated with variations]
- Intent upon the benefit of the two kayas
- Abiding in ground free of grasping, emanations in ten directions
- All arising, producing, and engaging arrived at completion

The repetition (*sang nge sal le...* appears twice) suggests either textual transmission variation or deliberate emphasis.

[960-964] [CONTEXT] Citation on "Complete" (*rdzogs*) - Part 3
**Analysis:** Five aspects of completion:
1. Outer, inner, secret actions transcended (*phyi nang gsang ba'i bya ba kun las 'das pas*)
2. Suddenly appearing in reference-free benefit (*dmigs med don la cig car snang bas*)
3. Not fallen toward any direction, without coming or going
4. Arisen from state, not made
5. All actions transcended

[965-969] [PHILOLOGY] Five Endowments (*chas pa lnga*)
**Analysis:** Five qualities "endowed" (*chas pa*):
1. Emptiness-wisdom endowed in itself (*stong pa'i ye shes rang la chas pa*)
2. Emptiness unceased, individually clear
3. Wisdom unceased, playing in method
4. Clear without thought, grasping not existent
5. Ornaments, forms, marks, characteristics held

[970-976] [CONTEXT] Citation on "Kaya" (*sku*) - Part 4
**Analysis:** Seven dimensions of the "body" aspect:
1. Grasping-free, self-clear, abiding as essence
2. Individual colors, marks and characteristics held
3. Vajra-meaning itself, endowed with benefit
4. Meaning-signs themselves, endowed with marks
5. Without outer or inner, clear in all
6. Essence unchanging, color clear
7. Nature compassion, arising in the ten directions

The structure progresses from internal essence (lines 970-972) through appearance (973-974) to manifestation (975-976).

[978] [STRUCTURE] Transition to Characteristics
**Analysis:** "Third, the characteristics" (*gsum pa mtshan nyid ni*)—transitioning from etymology/definition to the specific characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) of sambhogakaya.
