[STRUCTURE] This page presents critical philosophical analysis addressing potential misinterpretations of emptiness in Dzogchen result-phase [5516-5523], followed by boundary-marker analysis [5524-5539]. The structure employs dialectical reasoning (gal ba/contradiction), teleological analysis, and phenomenological description of the transition point (sa mtshams) between measure-completion and exhaustion.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5516-5518]: 'bras bu'i ka dag (result pure-from-beginning): term for fruition-phase primordial purity. snying tig pa: follower of Snying thig tradition (possibly pejorative in this context). shel 'od (crystal light): metaphor for transparent luminosity. dgongs pa ma lon pa (intent not realized): failure to understand implicit meaning.

Line [5519-5523]: lhun grub (spontaneous completion): one of two aspects of ground (gzhi) along with ka dag. 'dus ma byas (uncompounded): asaṃskṛta, unconditioned. gtan brlag (annihilation): nihilistic destruction, denied as implication. 'char gzhi (manifestation ground): basis from which appearance arises for others' benefit.

Line [5524-5539]: sa mtshams (boundary/limit): transition between phases. rkang lag bzhi'i sor mo (four limbs' digits): fingers-toes as somatic markers. 'od lnga (five lights): elemental colors. 'khyil ba (coiled/withdrawn): description of awareness absorbed into dharmakāya.

[CONTEXT] This passage represents Longchenpa's philosophical defense of Dzogchen against nihilistic interpretation. The critique targets those who, understanding emptiness (stong pa nyid) literally, deny all manifestation in the result-phase. Longchenpa argues this contradicts: (1) spontaneous completion (lhun grub), (2) uncompounded nature (not annihilation), (3) compassionate activity for beings, and (4) Samantabhadra's own display. This reflects Nyingma internal debates and broader Tibetan Buddhist concerns about Hva-shang-style "emptiness of everything" misinterpretations. The boundary-marker description provides concrete phenomenological criteria for transition between third and fourth visions.

[CONCEPT]
• Philosophical errors critiqued:
  - Denying form-kāya and wisdom in result
  - Confusing uncompounded with annihilation
  - Negating manifestation ground for others' benefit
  - Undermining compassionate activity

• Boundary markers (sa mtshams):
  - Five lights visible in digits
  - Transition to inner expanse
  - Outer vision return-turning point
  - Form-kāya's capacity for others' welfare

• Coiled absorption ('khyil ba):
  - Awareness enters dharmakāya
  - Like crystal light withdrawing inward
  - Body and vision's self-resonance reverses
  - Inner-clear spontaneous-completion jewel treasury
