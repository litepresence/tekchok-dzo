[STRUCTURE] This page concludes the bhūmi analysis with thirteenth through sixteenth grounds [5907-5934], establishing that bhūmis are not external but recognized within single truth-seeing. The structure employs enumeration markers, causal reasoning, and philosophical synthesis, culminating in the assertion of Dzogchen's direct approach.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5907-5909]: rig pa rang shar (awareness self-arisen): ground of all attainment. sa gud na yod pa ma yin (bhūmis do not exist elsewhere): critique of reification. bden pa mthong ba'i gang zag (truth-seeing person): single individual in whom all bhūmis complete.

Line [5910-5929]: Detailed enumeration: sa dang po (first bhūmi), sa gnyis pa (second), sa gsum pa (third), sa bzhi pa (fourth), sa lnga pa (fifth), sa drug pa (sixth), sa bdun pa (seventh), sa brgyad pa (eighth), sa dgu pa (ninth), sa bcu pa (tenth).

Line [5930-5934]: sbubs bor ba (abandoned retreat center): different progression. 'khrul snang 'gags (delusory appearance ceases): prerequisite for higher bhūmis. tshom bu'i snang ba (sphere vision): concentrated luminosity.

[CONTEXT] This passage represents Longchenpa's definitive statement on the relationship between Dzogchen and the bodhisattva path. The assertion that bhūmis are not external locations but stages recognized within a single individual's truth-seeing encapsulates Dzogchen's "sudden" approach. The enumeration of ten bhūmis with specific phenomenological markers (joy, self-display recognition, light vision, etc.) demonstrates how classical Mahāyāna categories are reinterpreted through Dzogchen's lens of direct recognition. The distinction between those maintaining and abandoning retreat reflects practical considerations while affirming that all bhūmis complete in original recognition.

[CONCEPT]
• Bhūmis as recognition stages:
  - Not external locations
  - Not sequential lifetimes
  - All present in single truth-seeing
  - Completion in original recognition

• Ten bhūmi phenomenology:
  1. Joy arises at truth-seeing
  2. Self-display recognized
  3. Light familiarization
  4. Wisdom vision
  5. Afflictions naturally purified
  6. Body from light ashes
  7. Afflictions distanced
  8. Non-moving stability
  9. Qualities complete
  10. Cloud-like dharmas

• Dzogchen direct approach:
  - All stages in single recognition
  - No gradual cultivation required
  - Original purity as basis
  - Spontaneous completion as result
