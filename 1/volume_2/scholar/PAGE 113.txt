[4954-4983] [STRUCTURE] Threefold Enumeration of "Three"
**Analysis:** The section presents a complex numerological analysis establishing why "three" is the determinate number for direct perception. The structure:
1. Outer: Three piths establish base (*gzhis gsum gyis gzhis bchas pa*)
2. Inner: Three paths clear obstacles (*lam gsum gyis geegs bsal ba*)
3. Secret: Three measures deliver to measure (*tshad gsum gyis tshad la phab pa*)
4. Result: Three fruits deliver to exhaustion point (*'bras bu gsum gyis zad sar bskyal ba*)

Each level uses *gsum* (three) with different referents, creating a hermeneutical spiral that reinforces the triadic structure.

[4954-4971] [PHILOLOGY] Enumerative Logic and Negative Determination
**Analysis:** The section uses *rtags* (sign/reason) logic to establish determinations:
- Base: Three piths → no difference in entity (*dngos po la tha dad med pa*)
- Path: Three paths → no near-far in going path (*'gro lam la nye ring med pa*)
- Measure: Three measures → no similar-different-random (*'dra min dang chal chol med pa*)
- Result: Three fruits → no yes-no-doubt (*yin min dang the tshom med pa*)

The negative determinations (*med pa*) establish the *apophatic* (via negativa) character of Dzogchen realization. The term *gsum tshig* (three group) at 4963 indicates the grammatical structure: three items grouped as four determinations.

[4954-4983] [CONTEXT] Integration of Practice and Result
**Analysis:** The text presents the correspondence between ordinary and yogic experience:
| Ordinary | Yogic |
|----------|-------|
| Pleasant (*dga'*) | Dharmata direct (*chos nyid mngon sum*) |
| Unpleasant (*mi dga'*) | Awareness measure-arriving (*rig pa tshad phebs*) |
| Equanimity (*btang snyoms*) | Dharmata exhausting (*chos nyid zad pa*) |

The threefold structure appears in:
- Guru's instruction: Dhatu, awareness, dharmas (*dbyings rig chos gsum*)
- Dharmata direct: Pith without intellect-word addition
- Habituation: Three bodies' light-point, self-ceasing delusion
- Measure-arriving: Clear-empty-pleasure (*gsal stong bde gsum*)

The definition of vision at 4979-4981 uses threefold structure:
- Whatever dawns, dharmata dawns
- Whatever field, dhatu dawns  
- Whatever manner, light-light-house-awareness hanging-cord dawns

[4974-4983] [CONCEPT] Dharmata Self-Exhaustion
**Analysis:** The section presents the *chos nyid zad pa* (dharmata exhausting) as the culmination:
1. Pith without intellect-word addition (*yid dpyod tshig gi sgro 'dogs su med pa*)
2. Habituation: Three bodies' light-point, delusion self-ceases
3. Measure-arriving: Direct seeing of clear-empty-pleasure three
4. Result: Dharmata self-exhausts (*chos nyid rang zad pa*)

The phrase *gsum zhes grangs kyi gnas gzhan la brten nas* (4978) indicates that "three" is a conventional enumeration relying on other bases, but the fruit liberates simultaneously (*cig car*). This reflects the *ekaksana* (one-instant) liberation teaching of the *Prajnaparamita*.
