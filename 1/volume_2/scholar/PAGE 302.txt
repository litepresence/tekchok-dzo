[13004-13015] [STRUCTURE] ## Bardo Ritual Timeline and Certainty
**Analysis:** This section establishes precise temporal parameters for the bardo rituals: 21 days maximum, with critical intervention points on the 7th and 49th days (*bdun phrag*). This numerology reflects the *bar do thos grol* system's seven-week bardo duration.

[13004-13007] [CONCEPT] The Forty-Nine Day Period
**Analysis:** The specification of "twenty-one until-even" and "seven-times seven" refers to the traditional 49-day bardo period. The seventh day ritual is particularly crucial as it marks the completion of the first weekly cycle when the consciousness is most receptive to guidance.

[13016-13030] [CONTEXT] Self-Arisen Teachings and Mandala Ritual
**Analysis:** The reference to *rang byung* (self-arisen) teachings connects to the *Rang shar* tantra tradition. The elaborate ritual structure—mandala preparation (*dkyil 'khor*), deity generation (*lha bskyed*), wisdom-being invitation (*ye shes spyan 'dren*), and offerings—derives from standard Nyingma *srid zhi* (samsara-nirvana) sadhana structures.

[13021-13024] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *dman pa*, 'bring, mchog
**Analysis:** The threefold hierarchy—*dman pa* (inferior), 'bring (middle), *mchog* (superior)—structures the ritual intensity. The instrumental *kyis* marks the agent performing the six-classes realm drawing ritual (*rigs drug gi zhing 'dren*).

[13031-13035] [CONTEXT] Vairochana Abhisambodhi Citation
**Analysis:** The citation from the *Vairochana Abhisambodhi* (a key *Yoga Tantra* text) establishes scriptural authority. The udumvara flower (*utpala*) metaphor indicates the rarity of encountering such teachings: even in a hundred kalpas, such opportunity rarely arises.

[13040-13048] [STRUCTURE] ## Five Path Presentation
**Analysis:** Longchenpa integrates the standard *lam lnga* (five paths) structure—accumulation (*tshogs*), preparation (*sbyor*), seeing (*mthong*), meditation (*sgom*), and no-more-learning (*mi slob*)—within the bardo context. The "supreme not-exist special path" refers to the fifth path transcending ordinary categories.
