[STRUCTURE]
This page transitions from tantric citations to sutra references, demonstrating the unity of the Great Vehicle's ultimate teaching. The structure presents: (1) citations from the *Dkon mchog ta la'i mdo* (Ratnagotravibhāga), (2) the *Ting nge 'dzin rgyal po'i mdo* (Samādhirāja Sūtra), (3) the *'Phags pa dkon mchog brtsegs pa* (Ārya Ratnakūṭa), (4) the *Gsang 'dus* (Guhyasamāja), followed by Longchenpa's transition to the second major section of "pointing out essence." This second section (*gnyis pa*) addresses the "non-duality of bondage and liberation" (*'ching grol gnyis su med pa*), subdivided into (a) general presentation through analysis of source, location, and destination (*byung gnas 'gro gsum*), and (b) specific determination through analysis of one and many (*gcig dang tha dad*). The structure then introduces the threefold analysis: source-ariser (*byung sa byung mkhan*), location-abider (*gnas sa gnas mkhan*), and destination-goer (*'gro sa 'gro mkhan*).

[PHILOLOGY]
The term *de bzhin gshegs pa* (tathāgata) appears in the *Ratnagotra* citation with the radical claim that tathāgatas are "always arising" (*rtag tu skye*) - an apparent contradiction to the doctrine of non-arising resolved through Dzogchen's perspective. The compound *bde bar gshegs pa* (sugatā/buddha) equates all phenomena with buddhahood. The term *byis pa'i blo can* (childish intelligence) refers to those who grasp at characteristics (*mtshan mar 'dzin*). The *Samādhirāja* citation uses the temporal formula *sngon bzhin* (as before) and *phyis kyang de bzhin* (later also thus) to establish the eternal sameness of dharmas. The phrase *ma rig nam mkha'* (ignorance like space) appears in the *Ratnakūṭa* citation, equating fundamental ignorance with space - not a defilement but the very condition of display. The term *sgyu 'dra* (like illusion) indicates the *māyā-like* nature of phenomena.

[CONTEXT]
The *Ratnagotravibhāga* (Uttaratantra) is the major Indian śāstra on buddha-nature (*tathāgatagarbha*), providing doctrinal foundation for Nyingma interpretations of universal enlightenment. The *Samādhirāja Sūtra* is a key *prajñāpāramitā* text emphasizing the sameness of all phenomena in their emptiness. The *Ratnakūṭa* is a vast collection of Mahāyāna sūtras, the citation here from its section on emptiness. The *Guhyasamāja* citation bridges sutra and tantra, as it is a major *father tantra* of the Sarma schools but cited here by Nyingma as supporting the dzogchen view. The transition to "analysis of source, location, and destination" (*byung gnas 'gro gsum gyis brtags pa*) reflects the standard Buddhist analytical meditation on the arising, abiding, and passing of phenomena, here applied to the mind itself.

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *de bzhin nyid* (suchness/tathatā) as the equivalence of all phenomena with buddhahood (*sangs rgyas dang 'dra*) is the foundation of "buddha-nature" thought. Longchenpa's citation of these sutras demonstrates Nyingma's claim to represent the authentic Great Vehicle, not merely a tantric innovation. The phrase *ma rig nam mkha' ji bzhin te* (ignorance is like space) is crucial: ignorance is not a defilement to be removed but the very "space" in which wisdom manifests. This distinguishes Dzogchen's "primordial purity" (*ka dag*) from gradualist approaches that view ignorance as adventitious. The threefold analysis (*byung gnas 'gro gsum*) of mind represents the "analytical wisdom" (*so sor rtog pa'i shes rab*) required to cut through (*thag bcad*) the root of dualistic perception. The term *gshis mtha' grol* (essence free from extremes) indicates that awareness is not merely empty of extremes but spontaneously free from their possibility.
