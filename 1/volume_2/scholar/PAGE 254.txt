[10968-10978] [CONTEXT] Relic Tantra Citation: Miraculous Powers
**Analysis:** Citation continues from Sku gdung 'bar ba describing siddhis resulting from kaya practice: flying in sky, penetrating mountains, entering earth, not drowning in water. Line 10976 marks the critical transition point: "dbyings rig gdeng du ma tshud na" (if expanse-awareness is not entered as confidence) — indicating these powers alone do not constitute realization.

[10977-10981] [CONCEPT] Element Dissolution at Death
**Analysis:** If confidence is not achieved, elements self-dissolve ('byung ba nyid ni rang dengs su) and at death, transferring to the bardo of reality (chos nyid kyi bar do), liberation occurs in five instants (skad cig lnga la grol bar 'gyur). This describes the "automatic liberation" characteristic of Dzogchen at death.

[10982-11025] [CONTEXT] Extended Verses on Nirmanakaya Signs
**Analysis:** Comprehensive enumeration of signs indicating nirmanakaya familiarity: (1) previously heard dharma meanings arising instantly in continuum, (2) spontaneously speaking unheard dharmas, (3) clear recitation of other tantras, (4) answering questions according to beings' dispositions, (5) lion-like speech, (6) enhanced physical powers, (7) reversal of aging, (8) rejuvenation, (9) arising of unprecedented compassion, (10) ability to give body/limbs, (11) touching nirmanakaya.

[10990-10991] [PHILOLOGY] Cig car du 'char ba
**Analysis:** "Simultaneously arising" — a key Dzogchen technical term distinguishing instantaneous recognition from gradual cultivation. The dharma meanings arise not sequentially but all-at-once (cig car).

[11003] [PHILOLOGY] Smra ba'i seng ge
**Analysis:** "Speech lion" (smra ba'i seng ge) — epithet indicating fearlessness and power in teaching. Derives from standard Mahayana epithets for the Buddha's speech.

[11014-11016] [CONCEPT] Arising of Spontaneous Compassion
**Analysis:** "sngon na med pa'i snying rje yang / 'di la gting nas skye ba dang / de rjes sems can don la 'jug" — unprecedented compassion arising from depth, followed by engaging in beings' benefit. This indicates compassion not as cultivated quality but as spontaneous expression of realization.

[11020-11023] [CONCEPT] Bodily Self-Sacrifice
**Analysis:** Ability to give body and limbs (lus dang yan lag gtong bar nus) and even to guru — represents the complete transcendence of self-grasping that characterizes advanced realization in Mahayana and Vajrayana frameworks.
