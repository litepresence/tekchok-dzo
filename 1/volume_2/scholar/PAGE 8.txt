[390-392] [CONTEXT] Citation Conclusion
**Analysis:** The Mutik Trengwa citation concludes, affirming that all dharmas indicating transcendence (*myang 'das mtshon pa'i chos*)—the practices and attainments listed on page 7—abide completely in body and mind.

[393-425] [STRUCTURE] Third Division: Completeness in Awareness
**Analysis:** The third of three completeness divisions addresses *rig pa* (awareness/pristine cognition) rather than body or mind. This is the Dzogchen perspective where all phenomena are complete in the nature of awareness itself.

[395-397] [CONCEPT] Self-Appearing Awareness
**Analysis:** *Rang snang rig pa* (self-appearing awareness) is a key Dzogchen term indicating that phenomena do not appear to an external perceiver but are self-manifestations of awareness. The verse asserts that all dharmas, however they appear (*ji ltar snang ba*), are complete in whatever "face" (*ngo*) of awareness they manifest.

[398-425] [CONCEPT] Awareness Correspondences
**Analysis:** The verse presents awareness-based correspondences (as distinguished from body-based on pages 6-7):

**Celestial:**
- Sun-Moon → Method and wisdom
- Male → Base (*gzhi*), Female → Path (*lam*)
- Planet → Measure of realization (*rtogs tshad*)
- Star → Dharma
- Cloud → Compassion pervading all

**Botanical (Philosophical):**
- Tree → Path of expanding dharma-nature
- Mountain → View without change
- Rock → Dharmakaya, free from birth/destruction
- Root → One cause of all dharmas
- Branch → Branch of awakening itself
- Trunk → One taste (*ro gcig*) in emptiness
- Leaf → Pervading dharma-dimension
- Flower → Lamp of wisdom
- Fruit → Three kayas self-complete

**Sensory (As Qualities):**
- Sound → Sound of dharma-nature field
- Smell → Fame of Buddha's speech
- Taste → Taste of bliss of experience
- Touch → Great concentration

**Ritual (As Protections/Insights):**
- Music → Complete mandala of five
- Canopy → Potential of clear color
- Parasol → Wisdom that protects
- Upper-canopy → Great essential point of instruction
- Banner → Manifest realization/buddhahood

[400] [PHILOLOGY] Gender Symbolism
**Analysis:** The correlation *skyes pa gzhi la bud med lam* (male as base, female as path) reflects the tantric symbolic system where:
- Male (*pho*) = space/ground/emptiness (*gzhi*)
- Female (*mo*) = appearance/path/compassion (*lam*)

[404] [CONCEPT] Mountain as Unchanging View
**Analysis:** *Ri ni lta ba 'gyur ba med* (mountain is view without change) evokes the metaphor of the mountain as unshakeable meditative stability and the view of primordial purity that cannot be altered.

[406-407] [CONTEXT] Bodhi Branch System
**Analysis:** The terms *byang chub yan lag* (branch of awakening) reference the classical *bodhyaṅga* system from Abhidharma (seven factors of enlightenment), here applied to botanical correspondences.

[408] [CONCEPT] One Taste
**Analysis:** *Ro gcig* (one taste) is a seminal Dzogchen term indicating that all phenomena have the same fundamental nature—whatever appears is of one taste in emptiness. This is the "taste" of non-duality.

[421-424] [CONCEPT] Mere Imputation
**Analysis:** The closing lines establish the *Madhyamaka* ontology underlying Dzogchen:
- All dharmas in the face of mind itself (*sems nyid ngo la*) abide primordially spontaneously complete
- Therefore, dharmas of mind (*blo*) and entity (*dngos po*) are merely imputed/labelled (*btags pa tsam*)

This echoes the *Cittamatra* and *Madhyamaka* doctrine that phenomena are nominal designations without inherent existence.

[426] [STRUCTURE] Major Transition: Inner Arising
**Analysis:** *Don gnyis pa* (second meaning) marks the transition to the second major topic: *nang 'byung* (inner arising). This is divided into:
1. Common divisions (*thun mong gi bar tu dbye ba*)
2. Nature of individual divisions (*dbye ba so so'i rang bzhin*)

[430-435] [CONCEPT] Coarse and Subtle Elements
**Analysis:** The distinction between:
- *Lus kyi 'byung lnga rags pa* (coarse five arising of body) = the physical elements
- *Dngas ma'i 'byung lnga* (essence five arising) = the subtle energetic elements

The subtle relies upon (*brten*) the coarse, thus "inner arising" (*nang 'byung*).

[435] [PHILOLOGY] Enumeration: Twenty-Five Limbs
**Analysis:** Each of five elements (wind, fire, earth, water, space) abides as five-fold, yielding 25 limbs (*yan lag nyi shu rtsa lnga*). This is the subtle body system of channels and energies.

[436] [PHILOLOGY] Definite Suitability
**Analysis:** *Nges pa'i 'thad pa* (definite suitability) is established by depending (*ltos nas*) on five different functions (*byed las mi 'dra ba lnga*). This is the logical justification for the five-fold division based on functional diversity.

[438-443] [CONTEXT] Rang Shar Citation on Inner Elements
**Analysis:** The Self-Arisen tantra affirms that the five great arising are complete (*tshang*) in one's own body. Then enumerates the wisdom-functions of each set of five:

**Five Winds** → Make wisdom potential (*ye shes kyi gdangs*)
**Five Fires** → Make wisdom potency (*rtsal*)
**Five Earths** → Make wisdom essence (*ngo bo*)
**Five Waters** → Make wisdom object (*yul*)
**Five Spaces** → Make wisdom abode (*gnas*)

[439] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Gdangs*
**Analysis:** *Gdangs* (potential/radiance/resonance) is a key Dzogchen term indicating the luminous, manifesting capacity of awareness—often translated as "sound-potential" or "luminous resonance."

[440] [PHILOLOGY] Terminology: *Rtsal*
**Analysis:** *Rtsal* (potency/power/expression) indicates the dynamic, creative expression of wisdom—the active manifestation of realization.
