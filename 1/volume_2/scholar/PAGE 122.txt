[STRUCTURE] This page presents the inner body measure (nang lus kyi tshad) through poetic citation [5285-5300] followed by phenomenological description [5301-5315]. The structure moves from external signs (visionary appearances) to internal physiology (channels, winds, drops), concluding with teleological implications. Enumerative markers (gnyis pa...gsum pa) organize the progression.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5285-5300]: Thal 'gyur citation enumerating ten signs: thad ka'i dngos snang 'gags pa (direct objects cease), sa rdo'i snang ba bzhu ba (earth-stone vision dissolve), rang shes ci la'ang tshud pa (self-knowing enters everything), de btsud bems po 'gul ba (inserted inert moves), rlung gi 'gyu ba'i tshad zin (wind movement measure grasped), lus kyi rdul phran mthong ba 'byung (body's subtle atoms seen appear), cir snang gzugs kur rdzogs pa (whatever appears as form-kāya completes), de las yab yum 'khril ba (from that father-mother embrace), lnga lnga yab dang yum sbyor (five-five father-mother union), kun kyang mu khyud zlum po la (all in round rim encirclement).

Line [5301-5306]: 'A dkar po (white A): seed syllable at heart center. 'od zer lnga (five light-rays): corresponding to five elements/wisdoms. thor tshugs (topknot/crown): cranial fontanelle as visionary aperture. rdul phran (subtle atoms): paramāṇu-level perception. lhun grub kyi sgo brgyad (eight doors of spontaneous completion): visionary apertures of the body.

[CONTEXT] The ten signs derive from classical Dzogchen visionary literature, particularly the Thod rgal sections of Snying thig ya bzhi. The physiology described operates within subtle body (phra ba'i lus) theory—central channel (rtsa dbu ma), heart cakra (snying ga), crown aperture (thor tshugs). The eight doors (sgo brgyad) correspond to sensory and cognitive apertures through which spontaneous vision manifests. This represents the interfacing of tantric subtle body theory with Dzogchen's direct vision approach.

[CONCEPT]
• Ten signs of body measure completion:
  - External: vision dissolution, earth-stone melting
  - Internal: self-knowing permeation, inert matter animation
  - Physiological: wind control, atomic vision, form-kāya completion
  - Visionary: yab-yum union, mandala encirclement

• Eight doors of spontaneous completion (lhun grub kyi sgo brgyad):
  - Eyes, ears, nose, tongue (four sensory)
  - Navel, heart, throat, crown (four cakra)
  - All visions as self-display (rang snang la snang ba)

• Crown aperture physiology:
  - Thor tshugs as wind-abode (rlung gnas)
  - Self-elevating wind (rang bzhin gyis 'deg pa)
  - Five-colored lights ('od zer lnga)
