[STRUCTURE]
This page concludes the analysis of mind's source-location-destination and transitions to the second aspect under "non-duality of bondage and liberation": analysis of one and many (*gcig dang tha dad la brtags pa*). The structure continues the threefold examination, applying it now to the philosophical problem of whether mind is singular (*gcig*) or multiple (*tha dad*). The opening summary (*snang sems 'brel med zang thal chen por mthong ba*) establishes the vision of appearances-mind as unconnected direct penetration. The page then cites the *'Phags pa dkon mchog brtsegs pa* (Ārya Ratnakūṭa) on the search for mind (*sems yongs su tshol ba*), presenting the standard Mahāyāna analysis: mind is not found externally, internally, or in-between; it has no color or form. This sutra citation serves as scriptural authority for the subsequent logical analysis.

[PHILOLOGY]
The compound *snang sems* (appearances-mind) indicates the nondual vision where external appearances and internal mind are not separate. The term *'brel med* (unconnected) suggests the non-causal, non-sequential nature of this vision. The phrase *chos zad kyi dgongs pa blo zad la shar ba* (the intention of exhausted phenomena dawning as intellect-exhausted) encapsulates the Dzogchen view: when conceptual exhaustion (*blo zad*) meets phenomenal exhaustion (*chos zad*), recognition occurs. The term *sems kyi khang bu* (mind's house/cell) is a metaphor for the enclosed nature of conceptual mind. The compound *'du byed* (conditioned factors) in *'du byas mi rtag* (conditioned things are impermanent) references the second seal of the dharma. The particle *pas* marks logical consequence: *rgyu yod na 'dus byas mi rtag pas* (if there is a cause, conditioned things are impermanent, therefore...).

[CONTEXT]
The *Ratnakūṭa* citation on searching for mind references the extensive literature on *cittamātra* (mind-only) analysis, particularly the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* and *Prajñāpāramitā* discussions of mind's unfindability. The assertion that mind is not blue (*sngon po*), not yellow (*ser po*), etc., follows the standard negation of perceptual attributes applied to the mind. The analysis of one and many (*gcig dang tha dad*) is the classic Buddhist and Indian philosophical dilemma: is the self/mind singular (like the ātman of Vedānta) or multiple (like the momentary cittas of Abhidharma)? Dzogchen's answer transcends both: neither singular nor plural, nor both, nor neither - the tetralemma (*catuṣkoṭi*) applied to mind itself. The *sems kyi khang bu bshig pa* (destroying mind's house) indicates the dismantling of the conceptual construction of self.

[CONCEPT]
The concept of *snang sems 'brel med* (appearances-mind unconnected) is paradoxical: appearances and mind are not connected by causation, yet they are not separate. This is the Dzogchen resolution of idealism vs. realism: appearances are mind, but mind is not the "cause" of appearances - both arise simultaneously as spontaneous display (*rtsal*). The phrase *chos zad blo zad* (exhaustion of phenomena, exhaustion of intellect) describes the meeting point of analysis and recognition: when conceptual elaboration is exhausted, the natural state appears. The analysis of one and many demonstrates that mind cannot be a singular entity (because it appears differently in different beings) nor multiple (because it has no parts). This is the *anekānta* (non-one-sided) logic of Madhyamaka applied to destroy the reified concept of mind, leaving only the "baseless awareness" (*gzhis med rig pa*) as the residuum of analysis. The term *lam gyi gnad tha dad pa'i 'jug sgo* (entry doors of different path vitals) refers to the various Buddhist vehicles, all transcended in Dzogchen's direct recognition.
