[STRUCTURE] This page extends the three-experience typology with detailed phenomenological analysis. The structural progression moves from distinguishing authentic vs. fabricated meditation [5092-5101] to cataloging eight visionary signs of the "end-change experience" [5102-5124], concluding with their diagnostic significance [5125-5130]. The passage employs enumerative logic (eight like-similes) and causal explanations (cause is.../phyir ro).

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5092]: rlung nyams (wind experience): technical term for energetic/visionary instability in subtle body practice. snang cha (vision part/aspect): indicates these are components of larger visionary taxonomy.

Lines [5093-5100]: Eight similes for visionary progression: firefly (srin bu me khyer), cloud (sprin), smoke (du ba), haze (smug zil), moon-dawn (zla ba shar ba), star-dawn (skar ma shar ba), sky-brightening (nam sros pa), sun-dawn (nyi ma shar ba). These follow classical Tögal visionary sequence from dim to clear appearances.

Line [5102]: mi brtan (not firm) + tshugs mi thub (cannot stand): diagnostic language for unstable visionary states requiring purification. 'gyur 'gro (change-go): continuous transformation indicating wind-agitation.

Line [5105-5111]: rig pa'i rang gdangs (awareness self-resonance): key Dzogchen term for natural luminosity not dependent on conditions. 'od gsal chen po (great luminous-clear): refers to dharmakāya luminosity. gnas skabs (occasion/state): technical term for practice stage.

[CONTEXT] The eight visionary signs catalogued here derive from the Thod rgal bar do'i ngo sprod and similar visionary tantras of the Atiyoga class. The progression from firefly to sun-dawn represents the standard four-stage schema of Tögal vision: (1) dharmatā (chos nyid snang ba), (2) increased experience (nyams gong 'phel), (3) awareness reaching full measure (rig pa tshad phebs), and (4) exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad). The physiological basis in wind (rlung) purification reflects the Completion Stage (rdzogs rim) physiology of the subtle body (lus).

[CONCEPT]
• Eight visionary signs taxonomy:
  - Firefly: initial flickering awareness
  - Cloud: diffused luminosity
  - Smoke: obscured clarity
  - Haze: dim manifestation
  - Moon-dawn: increasing clarity
  - Star-dawn: multiple points of light
  - Sky-brightening: expansive blue vision
  - Sun-dawn: unobstructed inner-outer clarity

• Diagnostic criteria:
  - Arising-ceasing ('char nub): impermanence marking wind-based phenomena
  - Clear-dim (gsal 'grib): variability indicating instability
  - Requires wind-mind purification (rlung sems dag dgos)

• Vision experience as chief (gtso bo):
  - Self-resonance returns to base (rang gdangs gzhi thim)
  - Reverses to inner (nang du bzlog pa)
  - Dissolves into spontaneous-completion pure dhatu (lhun grub ka dag gi dbyings)
