[6489-6490] [STRUCTURE] Conclusion of Causal Analysis
**Analysis:** The section concludes with citation from the All-Creating King establishing the "path without cause and condition" (*rgyu dang rkyen med zhi ba mchog gi lam*). This marks a transition from deconstructive analysis to the positive assertion of Dzogchen view—primordial peace (*zhi ba*) as the supreme path without dependence on causal conditions.

[6489] [PHILOLOGY] *Rgyu dang rkyen med zhi ba mchog gi lam*
**Analysis:** The phrase employs:
- *Rgyu dang rkyen med* (without cause and condition): ablative construction indicating freedom from
- *Zhi ba* (peace/cessation): the primordial state, not achieved through effort
- *Mchog gi lam* (supreme path): superlative indicating this transcends all lower vehicles

This is the *niṣprapañca* (non-conceptual) path distinguished from causal vehicles.

[6491-6493] [STRUCTURE] Ontological Status of Mind
**Analysis:** The text shifts to direct ontological inquiry: *sems yod na* (if mind exists), is it:
1. Material/formed (*dngos po gzugs can du yod dam*)
2. Formless (*gzugs med du yod*)

This binary presents the standard options for mind's substantial existence, both of which the text will negate.

[6494] [CONCEPT] Refutation of Material Mind
**Analysis:** The argument against material mind:
- If material: would be perceptible to sense-faculties (*dbang po'i mngon sum*)
- Would be visible/observable (*bltar rung ba*)
- But no such observable mind is perceived (*dmigs pa'i mngon sum*)

This follows standard Buddhist critique of materialism (*bhautika*), distinguishing mind from physical form (*rupa*).

[6495-6501] [PHILOLOGY] Movement Analysis
**Analysis:** The analysis of movement (*'gyu ba*) employs the standard Buddhist causal triad:
- *'Das ma 'ongs da lta gsum* (past, future, present three)
- *Phrad pa* (contact/meeting): the necessary condition for causation

The argument: if past and present movement meet (*'gyu ba sna ma dang da lta'i 'gyu ba phrad na*), then past memory would still exist unceased (*ma 'gags par yod dgos*). But this contradicts pastness (*sna ma yin par 'gal*). If they don't meet (*ma phrad na*), present cognition would arise without cause (*rgyu med 'gyur*).

[6495-6501] [CONTEXT] Classical Buddhist Kinematic Analysis
**Analysis:** This analysis of motion references:
- The *Kālakārīya* analysis of time and motion
- Nāgārjuna's critique of motion in *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* Chapter II
- The broader Buddhist project of deconstructing temporal processes

The conclusion *khegs so* (refuted/defeated) marks the successful negation of movement as a substantial entity.

[6502-6504] [STRUCTURE] One or Many Movement
**Analysis:** Applying the one/many dilemma to movement itself:
1. If one (*gcig*): variety (*sna tshogs par*) would be lost—movement could not appear in diverse forms
2. If different/plural (*tha dad*): mover (*'gyu byed*) being one would be lost—the unity of the moving subject collapses

Both options lead to *nyams* (loss/deficiency), demonstrating the untenability of substantialized movement.

[6505-6521] [CONCEPT] Fourfold Direct Introduction (*ngo sprod*)
**Analysis:** The text presents four methods of direct introduction to mind's nature:

1. **Space-Without (*nam med*)** [6508]:
   - Without space, memory-thought cannot be introduced (*ngo sprad*)
   - Therefore mind has no ground (*sems la gzhi med*)
   - Knowing this: no reversal place (*ldog sa med*)

2. **Appearance-Awareness (*snang shes*)** [6512-6516]:
   - Introduction between former and later appearances
   - Mind not established as cause or characteristic (*rgyu dang mtshan nyid du ma grub*)
   - Thought (*dran bsam*) adventitious (*glo bur gyi rtog pa*)

3. **Mind Former-Later (*blo sna phyis*)** [6518-6521]:
   - Introduction between former and later mind
   - Mind has no root (*rts ba med*)
   - Mind itself is one wheel of display (*sems nyid gcig gi 'khor lo*)

Each method progressively refines the recognition of mind's nature through direct introduction rather than conceptual analysis.

[6505] [PHILOLOGY] *Sems yod par ma grub*
**Analysis:** The phrase *sems yod par ma grub* (mind is not established as existing) employs the negative perfective *ma grub* (not established/proven) to indicate that mind cannot be substantiated through either existence or non-existence. This is the Madhyamaka *niḥsvabhāva* (without own-nature) applied specifically to mind.

[6506] [CONCEPT] Rootless as Space
**Analysis:** The simile *rtsa bral nam mkha' 'dra* (like space without root) establishes:
- No birth (*skye ba med*)
- No birthplace (*skye gzhi med*)
- Therefore no reversal place (*ldog pa'i sa med*)

Space (*nam mkha'*) serves as the quintessential example of uncaused, unconditioned, non-substantial existence.

[6510] [PHILOLOGY] *Khams gsum ming med chen po*
**Analysis:** The phrase *khams gsum ming med chen po* (three realms, great namelessness) employs:
- *Ming med* (nameless): beyond all designation and conceptual imputation
- *Chen po* (great): superlative indicating the vastness of this realization

This marks the transcendence of the entire samsaric structure through recognition of mind's nature.

[6511] [CONCEPT] Beyond Karma
**Analysis:** The realization that *las dge sdig gi phan gnon med* (no benefit or harm from virtuous or non-virtuous karma) does not constitute antinomianism but rather the transcendence of karma's operation from the perspective of realized mind. The phrase *blo bde ba* (mind at ease/peace) indicates the soteriological fruit of this recognition.
