[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes characteristics, confidence, and non-confusion (mtshan nyid yid ches 'khrul med) through fivefold definitional schema [5896-5920], scriptural citation [5921-5930], and concluding synthesis. The structure employs enumeration (five aspects), etymological analysis, and phenomenological description.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5896-5920]: mtshan nyid (characteristics): defining marks. yid ches (confidence): epistemic trust. 'khrul med (non-confusion): error-free recognition. nges shes (certain knowledge): definite understanding. blo yi yul (mind's object): cognitive domain.

Line [5921-5930]: Verse citation on snang stong dbyer med (appearance-emptiness inseparable), 'od gsal (luminous-clear), rang byung ye shes (self-arisen wisdom), stong gsum (three thousand worlds), bdud rtsi (nectar), sems kyi dri ma (mind's stain), rdzogs pa'i sangs rgyas (perfect buddha).

[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the epistemological foundations of Dzogchen practice—certain knowledge (nges shes) of appearance-emptiness inseparability. The five aspects provide a comprehensive framework: (1) characteristics—knowing what to recognize, (2) confidence—trust in the path, (3) non-confusion—freedom from error, (4) certain knowledge—definite understanding, (5) mind's object—cognitive domain. The verse citation grounds the presentation in canonical authority, emphasizing luminous-clear self-arisen wisdom as the nature of mind.

[CONCEPT]
• Five aspects of recognition:
  - Characteristics: defining marks of stages
  - Confidence: epistemic trust in path
  - Non-confusion: error-free discrimination
  - Certain knowledge: definite understanding
  - Mind's object: cognitive domain mastery

• Appearance-emptiness inseparability:
  - Not first appearance then emptiness
  - Simultaneous co-emergence
  - Naturally pure from beginning
  - Self-arisen wisdom as basis

• Teleological implications:
  - Three thousand worlds as domain
  - Nectar of immortality
  - Mind's stains purified
  - Perfect buddhahood attained
