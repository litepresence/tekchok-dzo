[STRUCTURE]
[SA BCAD: 2335-2386]
Page 47 presents the detailed instruction for appearance direct-placement (snang ba cer bzhag), forming the technical core of the conduct section. The structural organization follows an analogical exposition:

1. Snow-on-rock-salt simile (lines 2335-2336)
2. Appearance training in various phenomena (lines 2337-2346)
3. Dharmata training in unborn nature (lines 2347)
4. Six Vastnesses citation (lines 2348-2369)
5. Ground-rise intention emergence (lines 2370-2385)
6. Transition to fruit section (line 2386)

The page integrates practice instruction with philosophical exposition, using the Six Vastnesses (Klong drug pa) as the primary scriptural source for understanding the relationship between mind and appearance.

[PHILOLOGY]
[TERM: rdo tshan] - Wylie: rdo tshan. "Rock salt." Technical term in the simile describing how appearances self-liberate like snow falling on rock salt. Rock salt (sodium chloride in crystalline form) absorbs moisture immediately, serving as a metaphor for instant self-liberation.

[TERM: lhan gyis 'gro] - Wylie: lhan gyis 'gro. "Goes spontaneously" or "self-proceeds." Technical phrase indicating natural, effortless movement without deliberate direction. This describes the self-liberating quality of awareness.

[TERM: rang zhig] - Wylie: rang zhig. "Self-liberation" or "natural liberation." The most fundamental technical term in Dzogchen practice theory. The rang (self) indicates that liberation is intrinsic, not achieved through external intervention.

[TERM: 'dzin zhen] - Wylie: 'dzin zhen. "Grasping-clinging" or "fixation-attachment." Compound technical term for the dualistic mind that apprehends phenomena as inherently existent. The phrase 'dzin zhen grol nas indicates liberation from this fixation.

[TERM: bden pas stong pa] - Wylie: bden pas stong pa. "Empty of truth" or "devoid of inherent existence." Standard Madhyamika formulation indicating the lack of svabhava (inherent nature) in phenomena.

[TERM: chos can] - Wylie: chos can. "Phenomena-possessor" or "qualified subject." Technical term from Buddhist logic (hetuvidya) indicating the subject of a philosophical proposition. Here used to categorize various types of appearances.

[TERM: dum bu pa] - Wylie: dum bu pa. "Piece-like" or "fragmentary." Technical term describing the appearance of phenomena as distinct, separate entities. Training in dum bu pa means seeing through the apparent fragmentation of experience.

[TERM: chos spyi'i rnam pa] - Wylie: chos spyi'i rnam pa. "General form of dharmas." Technical epistemological term indicating the universal aspect of phenomena, distinguished from individual particulars (rang gi mtshan nyid).

[TERM: gdod ma nas zhi ba] - Wylie: gdod ma nas zhi ba. "Peaceful from the primordial." Technical Dzogchen phrase indicating that the nature of phenomena has never been disturbed, that peace is not achieved but original.

[TERM: skye ba yod pa'i sems nyid] - Wylie: skye ba yod pa'i sems nyid. "Mind-itself where arising exists." Technical phrase identifying the ground of appearance as the mind's nature. The phrase does not assert that mind arises, but that in the nature where arising appears, that itself is mind.

[TERM: 'gro drug] - Wylie: 'gro drug. "Six types" or "six realms." Standard enumeration of samsaric existence: gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings. The six realms appear through the self-dawning of mind.

[TERM: rang sar dag] - Wylie: rang sar dag. "Self-place pure." Technical phrase indicating that phenomena are pure in their own location without needing transformation. This is the Dzogchen doctrine of rang dag (self-purification).

[CONTEXT]
[CITATION: Klong drug pa] - Lines 2348-2369 present an extensive citation from the Six Vastnesses (Klong drug pa), a major Nyingma tantra of the Atiyoga class. The passage presents six modes of appearance arising from mind-itself:

1. Arising (skye ba yod pa): six-realm appearances self-dawn as different forms
2. Ceasing ('gag pa yod pa): impermanence self-dawns as natureless appearance
3. Elaboration (spros pa yod pa): various appearances self-dawn as individual perceptions
4. Showing (bstan du yod pa): sounds/words/names self-dawn as pure concepts
5. Visible (mthong du yod pa): conditions self-dawn as unmixed self-clarity
6. Existence-nonexistence (yod dang med pa): extremes self-dawn as self-place pure

This sixfold structure encompasses all possible phenomena within mind's self-display.

[DOXOGRAPHICAL NOTE: Self-Dawning Doctrine] - The citation's repeated use of rang shar (self-dawn, self-arise) reflects the central Dzogchen doctrine that phenomena are not created by mind but are the spontaneous display (rang snang) of mind's nature. This distinguishes Dzogchen from Cittamatra (mind-only) positions that assert mind creates phenomena.

[CONCEPT]
[ANALYSIS: Eight Metaphors for Appearance] - Lines 2339-2346 present eight similes for the nature of appearance:
1. Reflections (gzugs brnyan)
2. Water-moon (chu zla) - moon reflected in water
3. Sound-echo (sgra brnyan)
4. Emanations (sprul pa)
5. Illusions (sgyu ma)
6. Mirages (smig rgyu)
7. Optical illusions (mig yor)
8. Dream horse (rmi lam rta)

These eight similes function as contemplative supports—practitioners train in seeing all appearances through these analogies to recognize their illusory, insubstantial nature.

[ANALYSIS: Snow-on-Rock-Salt Simile] - The opening simile (lines 2335-2336) presents instant self-liberation: like snow falling on rock salt, appearances dissolve immediately upon arising without trace. This represents the highest level of Dzogchen practice—self-liberation at the moment of appearance (char grol) rather than through subsequent analysis.

[ANALYSIS: Phenomena as Different Pieces Training] - The phrase chos can tha dad dum bu pa la bslabs pas (lines 2339) indicates training in seeing phenomena as different pieces or fragments. This does not mean accepting fragmentation but training to see through the apparent separateness of phenomena to recognize their unified nature.

[ANALYSIS: Six Vastnesses Structure] - The Six Vastnesses citation presents a complete phenomenology:
- ARISING: Forms appear as the six realms
- CEASING: Impermanence appears as natureless
- ELABORATION: Variety appears as individual perceptions
- SHOWING: Language appears as pure concept
- VISIBLE: Conditions appear as unmixed clarity
- EXISTENCE/NONEXISTENCE: Extremes appear as self-pure

Each mode demonstrates how a different type of phenomenon is the self-dawning of mind, complete in its own place.

[ANALYSIS: Ground-Rise Intention] - Lines 2370-2385 present the dgongs pa (intention, aim) of snang srid gzhi bzhengs (appearance-existence ground-rise). Key passages:

- "Although not trained in samsara-nirvana dharmas, all self-dawn in mind, without obstacle to anything" (lines 2370-2371)
- "In mind-itself where there is no hope or fear, appearance without hope-fear is called 'directly-placed confidence intention'" (lines 2373-2375)
- "In mind-itself without appearance aspect, the sole subtle appearance is called 'great freedom from elaboration intention'" (lines 2377-2379)
- "By thus settling mind in intention, the yogin obtains power over mind and is liberated from stain-binding" (lines 2381-2384)

This establishes that the ground of appearance is itself the intention of Samantabhadra—spontaneous wisdom-display without deliberate aim.

[ANALYSIS: Two Types of Intention] - The citation distinguishes:
1. YE BZHAG GDENG LDAN DGONGS PA - Directly-placed confidence intention: appearance without hope or fear
2. SPROS BRAL CHEN PO'I DGONGS PA - Great freedom from elaboration intention: the subtle appearance in the absence of coarse manifestation

These represent two aspects of the same reality: the apparent and the subtle, both equally the display of mind's nature.
