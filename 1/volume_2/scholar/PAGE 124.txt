[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the fourth vision—exhaustion of dharmatā (chos nyid zad pa)—through phenomenological description [5358-5382] and scriptural citation [5364-5382]. The structure moves from causal explanation (las/byung) to teleological conclusion (don gyi 'bras bu), using comparative metaphors (skar mda', me stag). The passage employs technical terms for body-mind separation (lus sems 'brel chod).

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5358-5363]: rlung phir 'phangs (wind outward projected): energetic release from internal circulation. nang du ma bzung (not held internally): absence of reabsorption. rtog pa skad cig gnyis par mi sdod (thought not abide two moments): instantaneous thought-flow. lus sems 'brel chod (body-mind connection severed): somatic liberation marker.

Line [5361]: rnam shes kun gzhi'i cha (all-base consciousness aspect): residual cognitive structure. rtog med yul rig pa (non-conceptual object awareness): non-dual perception. me stag 'phro ba (sparks shooting): metaphor for energetic display.

Line [5370-5382]: mthong byed (seer/witness): subject pole. mthong bya (seen/objects): object pole. zag bcas (with outflows): conditioned phenomena. zag med (without outflows): unconditioned liberation. 'pho ba chen mo (great transference): highest attainment.

[CONTEXT] This material presents the culmination of Tögal practice—exhaustion of phenomena into dharmatā. The body-mind separation represents a key Dzogchen concept distinct from ordinary death; here the body becomes translucent (zang thal) while awareness expands limitlessly. The "great transference" ('pho ba chen mo) refers to the Vimalamitra tradition of leaving the body as light without remainder. The three realms (khams gsum) non-return (phyir mi ldog) marks irreversible liberation.

[CONCEPT]
• Fourth vision characteristics:
  - Dharmatā exhaustion (chos nyid zad pa)
  - Body-mind separation (lus sems 'brel chod)
  - Three realms non-return (khams gsum phyir mi ldog)
  - Great transference attainment ('pho ba chen mo)

• Cognitive transformation:
  - All-base consciousness as sparks (kun gzhi skar mda')
  - Awareness compassion wisdom (rig pa thugs rje shes rab)
  - Seer-seen duality dissolved (mthong byed gnyis)

• Somatic markers:
  - Unimpeded body (lus zang thal)
  - Light body completion ('od gsal sku)
  - Beyond death and birth ('chi skye dang bral)
