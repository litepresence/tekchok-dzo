[6454-6459] [STRUCTURE] Causal Implications: No Increase, No Birth
**Analysis:** This section traces the logical implications of mind having no cause (*rgyu med*). The structure follows a chain: no increase → no birth → no death → no agent/receiver (*las po*). Each negation builds upon the previous, culminating in scriptural citation from the *Samādhirāja-sūtra* (*Ting nge 'dzin rgyal po mdo*).

[6454-6455] [PHILOLOGY] *'Phel ba med pas skye ba med*
**Analysis:** The causal chain uses the ablative particle *pas* (because of/from) to indicate logical consequence:
- *'phel ba med pas* (from no increase)
- *skye ba med par shes* (know no birth)
- *skye ba med pas 'chi ba med par shes* (from no birth, know no death)

This demonstrates the Madhyamaka method of deconstructing temporal processes applied to mind.

[6456] [CONCEPT] Agent Without Object
**Analysis:** The phrase *las la po'ang ngan med par shes te* (and one knows there is also no bad/harm for the agent) indicates that without birth and death, the entire structure of karma—agent, action, and recipient—collapses. The term *las po* (agent/doer) finds no referent.

[6457-6459] [CONTEXT] *Samādhirāja-sūtra* Citation
**Analysis:** The citation *yod dang med pa 'di gnyis med pa'i chos yin te* (existence and non-existence, these two are dharmas of non-existence) from the King of Samādhi Sūtra establishes the transcendence of binary conceptual extremes. This situates the text within the *Prajñāpāramitā* tradition of non-dual wisdom.

[6460-6462] [PHILOLOGY] *Ye gdod ma nas rang gdod med*
**Analysis:** The phrase *ye gdod ma nas rang gdod med pa* (primordially, from the beginning, without self-establishment) employs *gdod ma nas* (from the primordial) and *rang gdod med* (without self-establishment) to indicate that mind has never arisen as a substantial entity. The rhetorical question *sems can skye bar ga la 'gyur* (how could beings arise?) underscores the impossibility of samsaric emergence.

[6463-6471] [STRUCTURE] Critique of Conditions Applied to Mind
**Analysis:** The text shifts to analyze conditions (*rkyen*) applied to mind, presenting another trilemma:
1. If conditions exist: mind would become various (*sna tshogs su 'gyur*), preventing unified memory-thought streams
2. If conditions exist: mind would necessarily be impermanent (*g tan 'jig par 'gyur*)
3. Without conditions: present memory-thought would be impossible

The resolution maintains *sgyu ma ltar gnas pa tsam* (merely existing like illusion) as the Middle Way.

[6463-6465] [CONCEPT] Condition Analysis
**Analysis:** The argument *sems la rkyen med pa* (mind has no conditions) parallels the earlier causal analysis:
- If conditions exist: colors/appearances would vary (*kha dog sogs pa sna tshogs su 'gyur*)
- This would make unified consciousness impossible (*dran bsam gcig tu mi rigs*)
- The body-color and sense-faculties (*lus kyi kha dog dang skye mched*) would all differ even while occupying a body

[6466-6471] [PHILOLOGY] Terminological Precision
**Analysis:** Key terms in the condition critique:
- *Rkyen* (condition): distinguished from *rgyu* (cause)—conditions are external supporting factors
- *Gtan 'jig pa* (certain destruction/impermanence): marks the necessary consequence of conditioned existence
- *Sgyu ma ltar gnas pa tsam* (merely existing like illusion): the *māyā-upamā* (illusion simile) common to both Madhyamaka and Yogācāra, indicating apparent existence without substantial nature

[6472-6488] [CONTEXT] *Rtsa ba shes rab* and *Kun byed rgyal po* Citations
**Analysis:** The page cites two authoritative sources:

1. **Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (lines 6480-6484):**
   - *Sa bon zhing dang ma zhing las/myu gu skye ba ma yin te* (From seed, field, or no-field, sprout is not born)
   - *Khyod kyis chos rnams thams cad ni/sgyu ma 'byung ba bzhin du bstan* (You taught all dharmas arise like illusion)

2. **All-Creating King (lines 6486-6488):**
   - *Rkyen lnga po ni yod ma yin* (Five conditions do not exist)

These establish the intertextual continuity with both Indian Madhyamaka and Tibetan Nyingma tantric sources.

[6472-6476] [CONCEPT] Dream and Illusion Analogies
**Analysis:** The text employs the *svapnopamā* (dream simile):
- Present memory-thought (*da lta'i dran bsam*) is compared to joy at finding jewels in last night's dream (*mdang gi rmi lam gyi nor bu rnyed pa la dga' ba*)
- Upon waking (*sad du*), nothing exists (*ci yang med pa*)
- Similarly, present fixation (*zhen*) on apparent reality reveals no true existence (*rjes la ci yang med pa*)

This illustrates *gnas skabs kyi bden rdzun* (apparent truth of the temporary state)—appearances without substantial existence.

[6477-6479] [CONCEPT] Cloud and Sky Simile
**Analysis:** The simile of clouds (*sprin*) in space (*nam mkha'*):
- Clouds gather temporarily (*glo bur du 'khrigs pa*) without going anywhere when they dissipate (*gar song cha med glo bur du yal ba*)
- Even while clouds appear (*snang ba*), they do not exist in space (*nam mkha' la med kyang de'i ngang na snang ba*)
- Similarly, appearances arise without cause/condition in mind

This demonstrates the *āgantuka* (adventitious) nature of appearances while mind remains unobscured.
