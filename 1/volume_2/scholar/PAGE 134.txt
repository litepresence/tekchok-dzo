[STRUCTURE] This page presents the definitive meaning of exhaustion (zad pa nges don) through scriptural citation [5811-5825], definitional analysis [5826-5840], and enumerative exposition of four visions arriving at measure [5841-5850]. The structure employs quotative authentication, etymological analysis, and teleological synthesis.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5811-5825]: Verse citation on chos rnams zad pa (dharmas exhausted), blo yi yul (mind's object), nges pa med (no certainty), sprul sku'i snang ba (nirmāṇakāya vision), 'ja' lus (rainbow body), sems kyi dri ma (mind's stain), dbang po (sense faculty), dngos su (actually), zad pa'i lus (exhausted body), rdo rje sku (vajra body), lhun grub (spontaneous completion).

Line [5826-5840]: zad pa'i nges don (exhaustion's definitive meaning): distinguished from provisional ('khrul snang—delusory appearance) and pure ka dag (pure-from-beginning). chos zad pa'i snang ba (dharmas exhausted vision): phenomena naturally self-liberated.

Line [5841-5850]: snang ba bzhi tshad du phyin pa (four visions arriving at measure): enumerated as chos nyid snang ba (dharmatā vision), nyams gong 'phel (increasing experience), rig pa tshad phebs (awareness arriving at measure), chos zad pa (exhaustion of dharmas).

[CONTEXT] This passage establishes the relationship between exhaustion (zad pa) and spontaneous completion (lhun grub) as result-phase attainments. The rainbow body ('ja' lus) appears as the somatic signature of complete realization—the body dissolves into light leaving only hair and nails, or nothing at all. The distinction between delusory appearance ('khrul snang) and exhaustion-vision (chos zad pa'i snang ba) clarifies that exhaustion is not mere cessation but recognition of primordial purity. The four visions as definitive criteria provide measurable indicators of progress on the path.

[CONCEPT]
• Definitive meaning of exhaustion:
  - Not mere cessation but recognition
  - Natural self-liberation of phenomena
  - Spontaneous completion as result
  - Rainbow body as somatic proof

• Four visions as criteria:
  - Dharmatā vision: initial recognition
  - Increasing experience: maturation
  - Awareness at measure: completion
  - Exhaustion: final liberation

• Somatic transformation:
  - Body's karmic outflows exhausted
  - Sense faculties transformed
  - Vajra body attained
  - Spontaneously complete without practice
