[STRUCTURE] This page analyzes the sixteenth topic's concluding section on three immovabilities (mi 'gul ba gsum) through enumeration [5931-5945], scriptural citation [5946-5960], and final synthesis. The structure employs tripartite division, comparative analysis, and teleological conclusion.

[PHILOLOGY] Line [5931-5945]: sems kyi mi 'gul ba gsum (mind's three immovabilities): distinct from body and wind immovabilities. rtog pa med pa (without thought): non-conceptuality. yengs pa med pa (without distraction): continuous presence. gco gcod med pa (without alteration): spontaneous stability.

Line [5946-5960]: Verse citation on sems nyid (mind itself), chos sku (dharmakāya), 'od gsal (luminous-clear), stong pa (empty), ye shes (wisdom), rig pa (awareness), zung 'jug (union).

Line [5961-5975]: gzhi (ground), lam (path), 'bras bu (result): classical Buddhist triad. sems nyid chos sku (mind itself dharmakāya): mind's nature is dharmakāya—not transformation but recognition.

[CONTEXT] This passage concludes the detailed analysis of Tögal practice with the mind's three immovabilities. The progression from body (physical) to wind (energetic) to mind (cognitive) represents the standard subtle-body hierarchy in tantric Buddhism. The verse citation emphasizes mind-itself (sems nyid) as dharmakāya—a key Dzogchen formulation distinguishing between ordinary mind (sems) and mind-nature (sems nyid). The integration of ground-path-result (gzhi-lam-'bras bu) provides the overarching framework for understanding Dzogchen as both transcendence of and completion within Buddhist soteriology.

[CONCEPT]
• Mind's three immovabilities:
  - Without thought: non-conceptual presence
  - Without distraction: continuous awareness
  - Without alteration: spontaneous stability
  - Culmination of body-wind-mind progression

• Mind-itself as dharmakāya:
  - Not transformation of mind into dharmakāya
  - Recognition of mind's nature as always dharmakāya
  - Luminous-clear emptiness
  - Wisdom-awareness union

• Ground-path-result integration:
  - Ground: original purity
  - Path: recognition and stabilization
  - Result: spontaneous perfection
  - Three times equality
