The death-manner of a yogin who has reached the end of practice is like, for example, when firewood is exhausted, the fire-mass also self-exhausts and dies. When the cause, the elements, are exhausted, without the condition of the body's dust-heap remaining—this is the sign of afflictions self-liberating in their own place! Like the two holy ones in Tsari, Dampa and Jomo, blazing as light-masses in the cave and going into space! When the dust-particles of the body, the vase, break at the place of primordial purity without before or after, mixing as one—this is the death-manner like space!

[13215-13223]
The visible body's in-between space, like space separately divided from substance; the realization of primordial purity abiding in the heart's clear light inside the body; like when a pot is broken, outer space and the pot's space mix inseparably—the body's dust-particles departing: "This is the body, and this is the rigpa inside"—knowing not, you become a buddha! This is the sign of liberation as a direct crossing-over at the place of primordial purity! The space and dakini death-manners both are death-manners of liberation through primordial purity trekcho. The fire-mass and vidyadhara both are death-manners of spontaneous liberation through thogal!

[13224-13229]
Where do such death-manners come from? As signs of confidence in Self-Perfected Dzogchen, not entering common philosophical tenets; as signs of understanding that meaning, not engaging words through mental analysis by seeing the meaning directly; through understanding the realization of primordial purity, knowing where your future destination is; without difficulty or fear of death, not doing any rituals of life-achievement or death-cheating!

Emaho! To die like space—without a trace!
