[636-639] Five waters continue—together with all your bones, all your blood, all your lymph. They abide in your two eyes, moistening everything without holding to any fixed essence. This is the nature of water wisdom—not grasping, just flowing, just nourishing. Feel that moisture in your eyes right now? That's not just biology, friend—that's wisdom displaying!

[640-653] Five spaces, from Self-Arising Tantra:
- Space pervading all in common
- Space of clear tone without object  
- Pure unmixed space
- Space indicating meaning
- Space liberating into pure field

These aren't five different spaces somewhere in the clouds! They're connected with actual awareness, five lights, the lamp of pure expanse, wisdom of signs, and the twenty-one pointing-out instructions. Certain confidence in example and meaning—this is what points you to what's already here!

[654-657] So all these five elements' awareness attributes summarized—they're the great elements. Their basis is the small elements. This completes the fifteenth division from the Treasury: Showing the Place of the Elements. Don't think you're done learning, though—this was just the foundation!

[658-663] Now that we've established elements as basis, we move to the fourfold purity of what's supported—the expanse and wisdom:
- Basis: the kayas
- Tone: the light  
- Supported: the wisdom
- Activities: enlightened actions

See the structure? Foundation first, then what rests upon it. Don't try to understand kayas without understanding what they rest upon!

[664-676] First, the kayas—two aspects:
1. General presentation of three kayas' expanse
2. Particular explanation of five kayas

Three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects, though essence is one. From Self-Arising: "Three kayas, wisdom-appearance, without obstruction to anything, perceived objects being one, essence appearing individually." Not three separate things—one awareness, three ways of shining!

[677-684] This is how awareness itself appears:
- Awareness without thought = dharmakaya essence
- Awareness uncensored and clear = sambhogakaya  
- Awareness appearing as whatever = nirmanakaya

Complete. Awakened. Right here, right now—not somewhere else, not later!

Emaho!
