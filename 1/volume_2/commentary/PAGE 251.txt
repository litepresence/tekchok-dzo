Listen here, you fortunate one! The text speaks of the signs that arise when you are close to complete liberation—like a traveler seeing the smoke of their destination village rising in the distance [1-5]. When you no longer wish to mingle with ordinary folk, when you feel you could soar through space, when the dissolution of appearances brings joy rather than fear—these are not ordinary experiences, you understand?

The root text says [10810-10814]: "Not wishing to associate with people"—this means you have naturally turned your mind away from samsaric chatter. Like a swan separating milk from water, you naturally gravitate toward solitude. Line 10814 speaks of having no attachment to body and life—you are like a beggar who has found a jewel in the rubbish heap; what need have you for the heap anymore?

Then comes the teaching on thigle, the bindus [10825-10845]. The text explains three types: the thigle of the body's channels, the thigle of the path, and the thigle of the final fruition. Think of it like this: the thigle in your channels is like the seed of a medicinal tree already planted in the soil. The path thigle is like the sap rising through the trunk. The fruition thigle is the fully ripened healing fruit!

Line 10832 speaks of the essence of thigle as "separate yet not separate, dwelling as one without duality." You must understand this directly, not merely as intellectual understanding. When you gaze at the sky and sky-gaze gazes back—this is the nature of thigle, beyond one and many.

The path thigle [10850-10853] is moved by the wisdom wind through the channels—like water flowing naturally downhill without being pushed. You don't need to force it! The four lamps shine upon their objects naturally, like the sun illuminating the valley without choosing which flowers to touch.

Line 10843 tells us of the five wisdom thigles dwelling unmoving in the central channel—this is your true nature, always present, like butter already in milk. You don't need to add anything or go anywhere!

Meditate on this, fortunate disciple. These signs and thigles are not fantasies but the natural display of your own rigpa when it matures. Like a lion who has no fear of the snare because he knows his strength, when these signs arise, know that liberation is certain.

Emaho!
