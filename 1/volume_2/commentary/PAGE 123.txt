The body arriving at measure also becomes thus: Free from the dust of individual bodies, the light-star-window of intermediate space appears. Then light-rays in the shape of hooks, subtle and coiling, hold the vision. The body's dust naturally ceasing, the copper-shining stainless light-body. The A mark in the center, and the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure. The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing. From the peaceful body's fingers, light-garlands coil in form. Activity of silent mind, from the skull palace of the head, Herukas manifestly arise. At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—the copper-shining three bodies coil as one.

Third, the secret awareness measure: Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified, there exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind, dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye. From that itself: At this time the mind is clear, together with the six clairvoyances, far and concealed dharmas become known in a moment. Measureless Buddha-realms and likewise bodies appear to mind. Defilements exhaust in empty mind, nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity. Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse, through manifest clarity, not separate from the many, without parts, without elaboration. That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness, at the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections, free from subtle and coarse defilements, the body-mind connection cut, outer visions' objects appear to awareness. The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness, like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.

Emaho! Copper-shining body, three coiled as one—this is your true form!
