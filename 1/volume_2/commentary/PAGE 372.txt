Listen! Lifespan five hundred fifty years complete. In that field, food and drink, merely thinking, satisfied. No exertion, supreme bliss. Even in existence, water with eight qualities, drinking eliminates. Various flowers offering to emanation body, extensively making offering, merely so. Four corners of that measureless palace, pearl stupas. Between four, bell turquoise net threads connected. Wind moves threads, bell sounds pleasant, various arise. Four directions, various silk banners. Wind moves them, various fragrant smells arise. That palace east from here, five hundred yojanas above. Those born bodhisattvas enjoy equally with thirty-three gods. East's emanation body field similarly exists.

South from here, glorious field, emanation body abode, four-cornered golden jewel house with awnings. Four doors with horse-drops. Four corners with stupas. Four sides with banners. Four directions with windows. Seven lakes with birds. Eight qualities water with iron mountains. Throne and Dharma also explained as above. Those bodhisattvas bound by one birth. Emanation body Jewel Source's field has such qualities. West from here, Lotus Piled field, emanation body Infinite Light exists. There too, equal to above qualities. North from here, world's realms...

Emaho! The "four directions" are the four immeasurables. The "thirty-three gods" represent the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment. The "golden house" is the dharmakaya. The "eight qualities of water" are the eightfold path. Every detail encodes profound meaning—don't read it as geography, read it as the architecture of awakening!
