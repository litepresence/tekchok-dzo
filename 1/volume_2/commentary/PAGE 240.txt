Listen well, devoted one! Signs arising, body-speech-mind yogi effort doing, in two lives liberation obtained - otherwise not obtained [10323-10384]! Signs and that nature - like this in beings too, before Buddha body-speech-mind purified, familiar signs like this arise, dakini!

For all Buddhas' body, whoever familiar before - speech word force, cut become not, this itself become suitable possessed! In one day, thousand verses or four hundred verses' meaning mind appears!

Whatever spoken benefits others - this before body familiar, dakini! Before all Buddhas' speech too, whoever familiar - voice like Brahma melody, pleasant to all ears! Thousand verses in one day mind grasped!

Beings all like servant, this by samsara become that! Before Buddha speech too, this familiar, dakini! For Buddhas' minds too, before familiar person, other word one spoken, that meaning that manner!

Like understanding, self spoken words, become not other following grasping! Before familiar dakini - like body-speech-mind, whoever familiar, in two lives Buddha obtained!

Now mind signs mind arise, familiar doing, in three lives mind vastness liberation shown! Signs definitely arise, but practice is essential! Without practice, even with signs, intermediate obstacle may enter, fruit not obtained!

Mind becomes disturbed place, body like form realm god, speech Brahma place! Do not be lazy, dear practitioner! Signs are guidance, but effort brings the fruit!

Emaho!
