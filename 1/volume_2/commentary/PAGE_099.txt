[4462-4466] Listen! From Jewel Garland: "Body's key point three types: lion's manner and elephant manner, sage like abiding!"

[4467-4475] Here three kayas also reversal different, one body also postures different three: First, emanation body posture: like sage crouching, foot soles two pressed—method and prajna connection arising key point! Soles two earth pressed—grasping-holding action wind two pressed key point! Knees navel joined—body's elements compressed key point! Body straight stretched—channels not contracted, wind naturally slow key point! Hands crossed—dharmadhatu and rigpa mixed key point! Chin horizontally stretched—wind field sent, self-luminosity key point!

[4476-4481] From Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body posture: relying on sage crouching, dharmata appearance self-emanated, dharma eye sees!"

Do you see? Posture is practice! Lion, elephant, sage—each posture liberates!

Emaho! Three postures of the three kayas!
