Listen, fortunate disciple! Now we arrive at the section on the kayas—the Buddha bodies [10900-10908]. Like a master jeweler examining precious gems, we must understand the nature of these manifestations.

The root text [10906] says the essence is "the abiding nature as the support of all phenomena beyond sorrow." You must realize: these kayas are not statues in a temple, remote and separate from you! They are your own nature displaying itself. Like fire that is both heat and light inseparable, the kayas are the natural expression of dharmata.

Line 10908 gives the etymology: "stainless self-perfect great zangthal." Zangthal means unobstructed, penetrating everywhere! Think of sunlight streaming through a window—it fills the room completely, leaving no corner dark. So does the stainless nature penetrate all phenomena.

The text distinguishes the three kayas [10910-10912]: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya. But listen carefully! In the Great Perfection, these are not merely results to be attained later—they are the path's own appearances. Like a dreamer who realizes he is dreaming, the dream becomes the path to awakening.

Line 10914 explains: "According to this Great Perfection system, the three kayas are considered as path appearances." This is profound! The very appearances you see right now—if recognized—are the kayas. Your ordinary perception is actually the three kayas in disguise, like a poor man who does not know he wears a jewel in his hair.

Line 10916 clarifies: "Dharmakaya is self-appearance." Whatever dharmas exist, as long as mind exists to perceive them, this is the path. As long as kayas exist, as long as body exists—these are path appearances, not the final ultimate. Do not mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself!

When the essence of practice matures and reaches its measure [10919-10923], we arrive at "the appearance of exhaustion"—approaching dissolution into kadag. Like ice melting back into water, all appearances naturally return to their source.

Line 10926 speaks of Lhungrub's appearances: "From the appearance of spontaneous presence, kayas, pure lands, and teachers appear." This is not creation from nothing! It is like reflections in a mirror—the mirror does not create the reflections, yet they clearly appear.

The signs of having accomplished the kayas are then described [10935-10967]: "Whoever has reached the measure of the kayas—to that fortunate being, these signs appear." When Chokyi Kaya is practiced, others cannot see the body; the yogin plays freely within himself. This is not mere invisibility—it is that the yogin's body has become indivisible from space itself!

Emaho!
