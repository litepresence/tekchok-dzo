[6027-6031] Listen, dear practitioner! Liberation arisen transcending object and thought! Roll into liberation direction-limitless, nameless! Not-look, look not—look-doer not, looked not see!

[6032-6035] Not-meditate, meditated not, transcended meditation, meditated also not liberated!

[6036-6041] Not-analyze, analyzed not, analysis not needed, analyzed also effort meaningless! Accomplishment not needed—already accomplished!

[6042-6048] Spontaneous self-liberation is the view! Effort-free self-established meditation! No-activity conduct! Result without hope! Dharmata's correct view spontaneously establishes all!

[6049-6052] From the Treasury: All these essence meanings are spontaneously presence's meaning! Not-thinking meditation is also meditation! Beyond intellect, spontaneously establish great!

Do you see, practitioner? You are looking for something that was never lost! Not-look, because there is nothing to see. Not-meditate, because you are already awakened. Not-analyze, because analysis is just more mind. Stop all this doing! Rest in what you already are!

Emaho! Spontaneous liberation beyond all meditation!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
