[979-984] Characteristics of sambhogakaya: mandalas of five families, unmixed, clear in tone. From Self-Arising: individual colors unmixed, marks held. Marks and exemplary features excellent, light rays blazing. Father, mother, and kaya form held. Rich display of enlightenment—not abstract, vividly present!

[986-993] Manner of appearance: from single nature of rigpa, from expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates performing benefit. Kaya of rigpa unmoving from expanse, without change—two completions in field of self-appearance light-clarity. Inner and outer appearance. From same nature: in one nature, two essences—this is sambhogakaya's appearance.

[994-1014] Manner of abiding: expanse without acceptance or rejection, space without duality, vast expanse of five complete lights, abiding in great continuity of radiating emanations. From Self-Arising: correctly produced without reference, without mind of entering or liberation. How could grasping exist? Beyond words of attachment. Beyond abandoning object and abandoner. Beyond field, mind, intellect. In reference-free field, self-appearance cuts through words. Grasping-free, liberated in own place, emanations enacted in ten directions. In reference-pure field appearance, wisdom arises in one cut. From that, emanations widely arise. Sambhogakaya's abiding—not stuck anywhere, radiating everywhere!

[1015-1020] Third: Nirmanakaya's ground—five aspects: essence, etymology, characteristic, division, method of examination.

Emaho! Three kayas complete!
