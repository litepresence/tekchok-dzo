Understanding the meaning of these bindings briefly explained, the word-meaning elaboration is enough. The second general meaning—decisive cutting on the spot, binding has three: decisive view as self-arisen wisdom, intention maintained as time-free three times, dharmata rested as nothing exhausted from the start.

First: one's own rigpa, empty-luminous unchanging nature—this is bare wide-open direct nature. Decide definitely! Don't fabricate or mix anything with mind's view-meditation-conduct-result dharma. Practice uncontrived spontaneous great completion view-meditation, vast natural flow.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Secret mantra rigpa resting is the knot of view-meditation-conduct. For outer inner secret wisdom, mind's conceptions unmoved—this is secret mantra's secret view. Bhagavan Lion's dharmakaya abides in non-dual samadhi..."

"From dharmakaya source of all, dissolving into vast objectless expanse. Without acceptance-rejection, it's conduct. Seeing self-appearance, it's view. Not distracted from that, explained as meditation..."

"Without abandoning-placing, obtaining samadhi. Without falling to extremes, reaching own place. Uncontrived, self-arisen, complete from the start."
