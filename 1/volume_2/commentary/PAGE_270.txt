Listen, fortunate one! From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle [11992-12010]: these various signs of the three times are definitively established. Thus the general topics of instructions, effort, and sharp faculties for liberation in this life with signs have been taught.

Now for middling practitioners [12011-12035], extensive establishment of bardo's manifest complete buddhahood is taught. Two aspects: general bardo arrangement and specific natures extensively explained.

Bardo's essence [12036-12050]: external phenomena appearing to internal mind's moment. All appearances from inner dharmadhatu ka-dag elsewhere are bardo's state—ka-dag's display as kayas and wisdoms is pure dharmata bardo; confused appearances of six realms are impure confusion bardo.

Where do pure and impure exist [12051-12070]? Between ka-dag's space and emergence, returning to ka-dag must occur, so between ka-dag's nature. From the beginning in first ka-dag [12071-12085], confusion's basis is inexpressible; non-confusion likewise. This point, if wisdom exists, is the great crucial seal.

Bardo's etymology [12086-12100]: "bar" means between above-below, before-after; "do" means holding extremes together like a connecting cord—like a pillar's middle binding cord.

Emaho!
