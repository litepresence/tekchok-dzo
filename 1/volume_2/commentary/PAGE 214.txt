Attend now to the light-body! [9209-9227] The light-body and samadhi-body have differences: light-body is rigpa's self-light without stain, buddha-eye's object but unseen by sentient beings. Samadhi deity-body is ripened habitual patterns' born, extremely pure four elements' atoms, seen by sentient beings with divine eye. The third point extensively explains the fivefold doctrine's wheel of wisdom in three parts: essence briefly shown, nature extensively explained, and aspects gathering meaning.

[9228-9241] First: from Sengé Tsal Dzogchen, what are the five doctrines? With Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine, view for meditation. With Wisdom Pouring's doctrine, ground to be taken. With Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine, examine display's arising. With Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine, carry meaning to its end. With Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, carry rigpa to the expanse.

[9242-9267] The first's nature is Mah Dzogchen's changeless clear light rigpa, dharma-expanse and wisdom non-dual. When faculties realize this, three individual faculties—excellent, middling, lesser—have view, meditation, conduct, result each fourfold, making twelve aspects. From Tsal Dzog: "When Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine dawns, Dzogchen view complete, excellent middling lesser faculties' views arise threefold. Excellent faculty's view: wisdom display spontaneously arising—own wisdom realizes non-conceptual rigpa with body. Meditation: unmoving in clarity like ocean's planets and stars. Conduct: ceaseless spontaneous like sky's meteor. Result: seeing unborn self-arisen display."

[9268-9304] Middling faculty's view realizes rigpa merely unborn. Meditation: like cloth floating on ocean, free from conceptual aspects. Conduct: unfabricated lunatic conduct, unimpeded in any display. Result: possessing self-abiding meditation through suppressing signs. Lesser faculty's view realizes displays as magical illusions or emanations. Meditation: like a lion cub separated from womb, recognizing own display, wisdom dawns in bardo, seeing enclosed wisdom. Conduct: possessing samsara-nirvana dualistic conduct. Result: leaving body, going to natural emanation body's pure land. Thus twelve aspects from three faculties' fourfold divisions.

Emaho!
