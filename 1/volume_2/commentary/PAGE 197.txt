Third: separation manner brief binding has three: direct self-time separation actual; separation validity placement; other expressions.

First: outer appearance light-luminous seen, without delusion inner self-clear meditation self-place clear time, mind and wisdom instant separated, all-ground eight collections wisdom-covered, samsara dharmas not clear. Past self-nature spontaneously complete.

From Samantabhadra heart mirror—"Rigpa free from mind actual Buddha. Wisdom free from mind actual intention. Rays free from darkness actual pure appearance."

From Self-Arising: "Rigpa free from mind actual Buddha. Vajrasattva free from mind I. Clear-illuminator appearance without thought knows. Thought-free wisdom equality, self's great self-liberation."

[8438-8456]
Second validity: placed unmoving in appearance nature, samsara dharmas self-dissolved gone—like water unmoving muddiness self-dissolved.

Jewel water clear example shows intention depth immeasurable.

From earlier: "Self-arisen nectar drop this, like jewel water clear. With impurity placed, impurity clears. Thus heart-essence instruction this, applied affliction not become stain."

Alone loose appearance companion-dawning. Unborn expanse wisdom light-luminous. All have, all not seeing. Inconceivable like sky expanse. Clear shining like sun light. Unchanging like Mount Meru. Deep immeasurable like ocean depth. Unstained like mud lotus. Unapprehended like water moon. Appearing as anything like sky miracle. Clear complete like rainbow.

Emaho! Separation from all obscurations!
