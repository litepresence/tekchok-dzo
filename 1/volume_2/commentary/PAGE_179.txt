From Tal 'Gyur: "Great Perfection nature's extreme: phenomena placed in own place. Appearance-awareness dharmata unified, primordial liberation just resting. Intention beyond mind; marked placed pure in own place; empty and existence extremes liberated; exhausted change without thought; mind-exhausted beyond thought."

From earlier: "Five elements primordially clear, appearance liberated in luminosity. Five senses naked placed, five grasping objects self-liberated in own place."

Also from Tal 'Gyur: "Self-mind liberation called—gone one to one nowhere. Mind without liberator, complete from ground without coming-going. Not found by examination, no cause. Rootless ground abides empty-luminous. Self-clear abiding mind, liberated by key without partiality. Liberated by time without reference. Liberated without effort without diligence. Liberated by confidence without effort. Explained liberation by confidence. Primordially liberated without returning ground. Self-liberated by itself without antidote. Relaxed release, even seeing place, completely liberated effortless."

Three gates primordially liberated, so from first no need for effort-liberation. Body need not transform mudra, etc.—elements self-liberated by key, not returning to six realms. Speech need not effort heart-essence recitation, etc.—expression clear-pure liberated, speech self-liberated by sound-meaning key. Mind need not effort samadhi meditation, etc.—whatever thought liberated by intention key. Nothing arising from other, self-liberated—impossible to have antidote.

Emaho! Liberation without antidotes or effort!
