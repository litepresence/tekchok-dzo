Like fruit of ali ka (eggplant) ripening from start—now no ripening cause.

Primordial liberation has three: understanding primordial liberation; establishing valid placement; liberation mode.

Understanding: not adventitious, liberated from first, now no liberating—key is rigpa itself never experienced delusion.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning validity; scripture validity; reason validity.

Reasoning: primordially rigpa itself liberated—no ground so no return; no root so no source; no characteristic so not established; unborn so no liberation cause.

Sign of primordial liberation: no characteristic seen by any meditation-accomplishment. Validated by cause-effect traceless reasoning—rigpa no stream, no result, karma and ripening impossible.

Scripture validity: from Meaningful Diligence—"Mind itself primordially liberated—how could outer liberation condition exist?"

Reason validity: established by release-relax-place reason—placing primordially liberated, self-liberated in own place, primordially liberated.

Also knowing primordially liberated by key of no source, no abiding, no going.

Liberation mode: called liberated because mind empty; or unliberated—merely conventional term—sign of primordially liberated.

Emaho! Primordially free, nothing to achieve!
