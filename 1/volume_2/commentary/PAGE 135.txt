Practical instruction! Seven vajras of accomplishing, seven siddhis of maturation.

Accomplishing vajras: body's creative play yoga—creates emanations, obstacles, powers. Mantra accomplishing: spiritual powers from recitation. Dream accomplishing: mastery of dream states, clear light realization. Bardo accomplishing: recognizing bardo appearances, transforming them.

Maturation siddhis: liberation through primordial wisdom—sees ground's emptiness. Manifestation siddhi: displays emanations for benefit. Power siddhi: influence over elements, space, time. Knowledge siddhi: complete knowledge of all vehicles, past future.

Each vajra has protection and accomplishment—like a king with seven eyes: sees everywhere, knows everything.

How they manifest: Body emanates spontaneously when mind dwells in emptiness. Speech comes forth spontaneously when concentration deepens. Mind remains unshaken, all obstacles self-liberate.

Emaho! Seven vajras—seven eyes, perfect wisdom!
