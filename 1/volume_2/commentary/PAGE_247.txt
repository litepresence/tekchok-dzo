Listen to the completion of this chapter! [12306-12330] Thus has been explained the twenty-first chapter on the key points of thod rgal practice. The wisdom of direct transcendence is the swift path to buddhahood in one lifetime.

[12331-12355] Through the practice of lamp-gazing, you see the displays of your own awareness. Through these displays, you recognize your true nature. Through this recognition, you are liberated. This is the extraordinary method of the great perfection.

[12356-12380] The four visions are the measure of your progress: the direct perception of dharmata, the increase of experience, the perfection of rigpa, and the exhaustion of phenomena. When the fourth is reached, buddhahood is attained.

[12381-12405] Do not think this is far away. The nature of your own mind is already perfect. The displays you see are already pure. The liberation you seek is already present. You need only recognize this!

[12406-12430] The lama's introduction is like a spark that ignites the fire of wisdom. Your practice is like adding fuel to that fire. The result is like the blazing inferno that consumes all delusion. Let this fire burn brightly!

[12431-12455] Some wonder whether the displays are external or internal. This very question shows delusion! In the nature of mind, there is no division of inner and outer. All displays are the play of your own awareness.

[12456-12480] When you understand this completely, you are liberated in the very moment of perception. Samsara and nirvana become one display. This is the great equal taste—the ultimate fruit of thod rgal practice.

Emaho!
