From the Pearl Garland: Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields—liberated in family and family's lord. Thus it is said. Conditions are liberated by conditions, so I do not rely on observed dharmas. Objects are liberated in objects, so I do not rely on the two grasping and holding. Cause is liberated in cause itself, so I do not rely on the two samsara and nirvana. Dharmas are liberated in dharmas, so I do not rely on concepts and words. Mind-itself is liberated in mind, so I do not rely on indicating mind.

Listen to this! From the Pearl Garland tantra—everything self-liberates. The aggregates liberate themselves. The elements liberate themselves. The sense-fields liberate themselves. Conditions liberate themselves. Objects liberate themselves. Mind liberates itself.

What does this mean? It means you don't need to do anything! The liberation is already happening. The problem is your reliance, your grasping, your trying to fix things. Longchenpa repeats: "I do not rely." This is the key!

You don't need to rely on observed phenomena. You don't need to rely on grasping and holding. You don't need to rely on samsara or nirvana. You don't need to rely on concepts and words. You don't even need to rely on mind!

This is the ultimate freedom—complete non-reliance. Not rejection, but non-reliance. Things are as they are. Let them be. Don't try to control them, don't try to change them, don't try to rely on them for your happiness or your understanding. Just let everything self-liberate.

From the Six Vastnesses:

In mind-itself where six-aggregates appear,
Thought-assemblies self-place pure.

In mind-itself where sounds and words appear,
Concepts and names self-place pure.

In mind-itself where coarse appearances,
Four elements' conditions self-place pure.

In mind-itself where grasping and holding appear,
Binding self-grasp pure.

In mind-itself where existence appears,
Phenomena self-place pure.

In mind-itself where non-existence appears,
Emptinesses self-place pure.

In mind-itself where existence and non-existence,
Establishing extremes self-place pure.

This is the view of the Great Perfection. Everything is self-pure in its own place. The six aggregates—self-pure. Thoughts—self-pure. Concepts—self-pure. The four elements—self-pure. Grasping and holding—self-pure. Even the idea of existence—self-pure. The idea of non-existence—self-pure. Both existence and non-existence together—self-pure.

What does "self-place pure" mean? It means each phenomenon is already pure in its own nature. You don't need to purify it. You don't need to transform it. You don't need to do anything to it. It's already pure from the beginning.

This is why the guru's instruction is so crucial. Once you receive this pointing-out instruction and recognize it, you see that everything has always been pure. The thoughts you've been trying to stop—they're pure. The emotions you've been trying to control—they're pure. The world you've been trying to understand—they're pure.

Stop trying to fix your mind! Stop trying to purify your experience! It's already pure. Just recognize this. That's all.

Emaho! Everything self-liberates in its own place!
