First moment: recognize! Second moment: liberate upon knowing! Third moment: dissolve into primordial purity from liberation, and after that no appearance whatsoever! These too, if elaborated with scripture, are elegant for the wise. But don't get stuck in the words! The recognition in the first moment is everything—like meeting an old friend in a crowd. The second moment of liberation is like the cloud dissolving into the sky.

Emaho! Three moments—three opportunities for liberation!
