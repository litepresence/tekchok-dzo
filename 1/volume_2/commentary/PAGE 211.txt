Now listen, you who would enter the clear light! [9043-9067] Entering clarity means from the five lights' display first comes smoke-like, then mirage-like, then cloud-like, then fire-sparks, sun, moon, star-forms, mid-space rainbow, clear white light, clear yellow, clear red, clear green, blue, variegated, network designs, radiating spokes, round gatherings, bindus, stupas, deity bodies, various sentient being forms appearing everywhere self-displayed. When entering clarity, immeasurable displays of five winds arise. From the Thalgyur: "From that, wisdom-increasing experiences of color and form pervade clearly outer and inner, increasing progressively upward. At this time, body and speech bliss-signs—match display's measure and sequence."

[9068-9101] The third point concerns how displays arise: first from red-yellow round ones, later surrounded by five lights' rims. Through wind's crucial point of movement, held outward gently—this is crucial. Then through practicing the clear aspect, the lamp becomes like a mirror, light like a shield, bindus like a shield-boss, and from these bodies with features expand. From that: "Thus the gazed display first perfects red pure, complete round self-clear; from two fingers become three. Then again and again pressing, five wisdoms' colors—white, red, green, blue, yellow—appear to senses through effort. Then effortless outer through wind's aspect going-coming, from mirror-like forms alone appear two and three aspects."

[9102-9128] From constant familiarity, from just circles five-colored lights appear cut-off—this is the measure of vision's field. From that familiarity reaching measure, bindus with bodies in bindu essence, half-bodies remaining awhile. Five sets paired with their consorts, extremely clear bindus connecting—father-mother body displays, deluded displays exhausted thus pure lands. These have outer and inner displays—if you practice thus with excellent diligence, three years; middling, five years; lesser, seven years eleven months six days—then seeing dharmata's exhausted display, liberation into light body occurs.

Emaho!
