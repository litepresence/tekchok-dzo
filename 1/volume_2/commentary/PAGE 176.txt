First: general explanation of self-liberation's meaning. Second: particular explanation of self-liberation's dharmata. Third: extensive expression of self-liberation's intention.

First: In the path of Ati Vajra Heart Essence extracting from afflictions, purifying afflictions without abandoning in place—not like Hearers abandoning, not like Bodhisattvas abandoning, not like lower mantra creation stage transforming, not like completion stage self-pacifying, not like general common vehicles taming with antidotes, not like Mind Section placing in own system, not like Space Section making that dharmata.

Why? If afflictions' suchness is not known as never experienced, not abandoned by abandoning. If mind abandons afflictions, abandoned and abandisher being one substance cannot purify. If wisdom abandons, mind doesn't see wisdom. Wisdom not seeing mind, not abiding together—actual contradiction—abandoned-abandisher term doesn't apply.

Not abandoned by before-after. Past-future substance contradiction. One exists, one ceases. If simultaneous, mutually mixed—abandoned becomes antidote, antidote becomes abandoned—for mind-stream one time simultaneous.

Also, afflictions arising from that mind itself—like body and shadow—no time of abandoning by abandoning. Similarly applies to training, etc.

From Sun Moon Union: "If suchness not realized, yogin like body and shadow. From that self-arisen—abandoning doesn't abandon. Training also not. Transforming doesn't transform..."

Emaho! Self-liberated from the very beginning!
