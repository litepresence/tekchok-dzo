You see, in that terrifying place dwells something utterly hair-raising! Don't be afraid—proceed with the garuda's soaring stride through space! Beyond the passed-away one is the Primordial Buddha called Unchanging Light. You will see him! At the time of seeing him, he teaches the Dharma of the inseparability of the three kayas! Since Dharmakaya is shown as free from all arising and ceasing, you will completely pass into parinirvana with body, speech, and mind inseparable!

At that time, son of noble family, make your body firm! Make your speech firm! Make your mind firm! Make your rigpa firm! This means birthlessness! Having spoken thus, teach the path. Then dedicate, make aspirations, and pronounce auspicious words to conclude the ritual activity. This ritual is specially taught for those who belong to the disciples of this Self-Perfected Dzogchen. It is deeper and superior than the seven-day rituals of common secret mantra. Therefore, may those who would be vajra masters of this Dharma take it into their hands as a legacy!

The eighth topic: presentation of the uncommon other locations has two parts: the general presentation of yogins' death-manner and the specific explanation of how the elements dissolve. The first: death-manners of best, medium, and least faculties. The least is like worldly people explained above.

At the time of sickness, calling mothers, doctors, doing various rituals—this is a sign of not seeing the true nature of Dharma. Hoping in divinations, mantras, medicine, and calculations makes you no different than tirthikas! Then at death-time too, dying surrounded by relatives, students, and friends; after death doing virtue, mourning, and lamentation; doing seven-day rituals and cremation—these are the death-manners of worldly beginners.

Emaho! To die like a worldly person—surrounded by weeping!
