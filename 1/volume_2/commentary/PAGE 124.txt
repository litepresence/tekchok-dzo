Listen well, devoted practitioner! Fourth, dharmata exhaust vision has two aspects [5389]: exhaust manner shown briefly [5390], and nature explained extensively [5391]. First: before measure-arrive moon full like vision-from, self-resonance expanse-to dissolve manner [5392-5393]. That-from moon waning like, again body that fade-from bindu-to reach etc. first mind-to certain vision [5394-5396].

That container contents arise abide destroy empty four sequence-through vision four purify manner-to meaning sequence apply [5397]. Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass [5477]. Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain [5478]. All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from [5479].

Path dharma exhaust result by-say [5480]. That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace [5481]. Thalgyur from: "Self-Buddha cease dharmata, element cease-from dust cease, dust and particle end cease-from, part merely also abide not, affliction cease-from delusion and, concept-free attachment not abide-from, latency and all-from arise, dust part merely also not abide, thus subtle coarse cease-from, aggregate five also end gradual subtle, element four body exhaust-from, all wisdom Sambhogakaya, concept-free samadhi self-abide, fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from, dharma by-say word-to not abide" [5482-5498].

Empty dharmata - channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust [5499-5500]. Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from [5501]. Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express [5502].

Again before from: "Cause and result dharmata, conceptuality coarse source cease-from, memory self-pure continuum-from also, dependent-arising wind itself fully-pure, cause-from arise dharmata, primordial-from pure nature-to, one and many number exhaust, body and wisdom not-exist and, dharmas exhaust ground arrive, result dharmata is think" [5503-5513].

Dear practitioner, all dharmas exhaust into the ground - this is the result! Emaho!
