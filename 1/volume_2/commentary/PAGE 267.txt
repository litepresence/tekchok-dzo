Fortunate one, understand this! Earth-shaking signs [11794-11822] indicate the six realms' rebirth when liberation is not achieved. Two paths exist: dharmata bardo and samsara bardo—without these, no path exists. Results: buddha or sentient being—no other destination.

The five paths to buddhahood [11823-11842]: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, completion. Samsara's confused paths [11843-11857]: dream path, habitual path, karma's end path, uncertain illusion path, uncertain cause-result path. Know these well!

Hell-realm signs [11858-11881]: at death, dark clouds gathering like smoke, rain, steam, great wind, hail, falling dust. These indicate the eight hot hells, eight cold hells, neighboring, sentient-being hell, vajra hell—seven destinations of intense suffering.

The Avatamsaka Sutra [11882-11900] teaches: rejecting Dharma leads to Avici hell, lasting an entire kalpa, suffering immeasurable. Even when the great fire kalpa burns, you remain—such is the result of abandoning the holy Dharma!

For tantric practitioners [11901-11913], violating vajra guru samaya leads to Vajra Hell—lasting until the ocean is emptied by hair-strands, kalpas as numerous as ocean drops. Do not take samaya lightly!

Emaho!
