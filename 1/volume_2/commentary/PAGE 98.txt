Here's the secret! Two lights! Two paths! This is pith of ground path's preliminary to nine vehicles.

Two aspects: gradual and maturation path. Gradual: scriptural basis with three components—bodhicitta prayer, meditation, conduct. Maturation: trust in ground is support for two paths—showing which one to enter.

Actual maturation path's seven aspects: yoga-of-knowledge-of-emptiness, yoga-of-conduct, yoga-of-candali, yoga-of-mantra, yoga-of-offering, yoga-of-purification, yoga-of-accomplishment. Each has nature: outer, inner, secret.

Yoga of knowledge emptiness: outer is scriptural view, inner is analytical view, secret is Guru Yoga's unmediated realization.

Yoga of conduct: outer—ten virtues with letters, inner—six confluences without letters, secret—uncontrived discipline abiding in expanse.

Yoga of candali: outer—visualizing recitation, inner—actual mandala offering, secret—guru's expanse mandala.

Yoga of mantra: outer—collection and purification, inner—recitation through channels, secret—mind enters mantra expanse.

Yoga of offering: outer—external offering substances, inner—self-offering through realization, secret—offering realization to bliss.

Yoga of purification: outer—purifying negativities, inner—purifying dualistic grasping, secret—purifying extremes through seeing expanse.

Yoga of accomplishment: outer—bindus to dharmata, inner—wisdom nature binding, secret—bliss binds non-conceptual expanse.

Emaho! Two lamps—bright as sun and moon!
