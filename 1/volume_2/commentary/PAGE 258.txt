Ah, listen! Signs are mere indications, not guarantees [11232-11244]. Having signs does not mean liberation; liberation always has signs. Do not be deceived by ordinary spiritual attainments or gradual paths of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas—these are different grounds without the great pure result.

One with complete body and speech signs [11245-11264] dwells on the great sameness ground, then manifests for others' benefit for countless aeons in a single human body, perfecting enlightenment without intermediate births.

Body and mind signs together [11265-11278] bring swift self-liberation; speech and mind signs bring rainbow body in ten years; all three signs complete bring Buddhahood in two years! Like a mighty river that gathers tributaries, combined signs create a torrent of realization.

But listen [11279-11291]—without distinguished outer and inner signs, mere signs are uncertain. Do not deceive yourself claiming Dzogchen view while lacking genuine confidence in the natural state! A clay pot painted gold is still clay inside.

The text warns [11292-11310]: one who claims confidence without signs is merely intellectualizing. Such a person wanders long in samsara. But for thodgal practitioners who truly mature space and awareness, these signs arise inevitably.

Emaho!
