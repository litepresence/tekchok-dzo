[1303-1326] Listen, friend! These appearances aren't somewhere else—they're the play of your own mind right now. When outer light draws inward, when ground is seized and crystal light gathers within, this is like abiding as the basis of arising without clear form, yet clarity itself is never absent. 

Look here! The Self-Arisen One explains how light, kaya, and primordial wisdom; the consort mother, elements, and aggregates; ground and Buddha family—all these are one taste, not separate things. To all beings this abides in their very own body. Don't seek it elsewhere!

That appearance of great wisdom abides in the center of your tsitta—your own heart center! The path arises from inside like an ocean; the field is the empty sky; the body is kayas and wisdom; the eye is the lamp of wisdom; the essence is the all-clear mirror. See how everything is perfect complete right where you are?

The example is the stainless lapis crystal kaya. The time is the dharmata intermediate state. When you arrive at the extent of the jewel cavity—this is it! If these appearances are seen as they are, this is called 'the manner of appearance of pure one-cutting in this intermediate state.' Recognize it now, don't wait for later!

[1327-1375] When the measure arrives—when the portion liberated from the binding of the five aggregates occurs—inside tone arises outward, and the great appearance of five lights arises in the sky above. From that itself comes the appearance of pure one-cutting.

Listen carefully! In the sky of pure wisdom, five lights unchanging and clear arise. Also five clusters of five arise in the manner of father-mother union. Here are the colors and their meaning:

Blue—Vairocana kaya, dharmadhatu wisdom, Akashadhatvishvari mother, empty sky element, form aggregate, ground of completed action, Thus-Come family.

White—Vajrasattva kaya, mirror wisdom, Mamaki mother, great river element, perception aggregate, ground of relinquished action, vajra family.

Yellow—Ratnasambhava kaya, equality wisdom, Buddha-Lochana mother, great producing ground element, formation aggregate, ground of various arising, jewel family.

Red—Amitabha kaya, discriminating wisdom, Pandaravasini mother, burning fire element, consciousness aggregate, ground showing aspects, lotus family.

Green—Amoghasiddhi kaya, all-accomplishing wisdom, Samayatara mother, supporting wind element, feeling aggregate, ground of finished action, karma family.

Emaho! Five lights, five colors, five kayas, five wisdoms, five mothers, five elements, five aggregates—all complete in your own mind! Don't think this is far away. It's right here, right now, the natural display of your own rigpa! Recognize, recognize, recognize!
