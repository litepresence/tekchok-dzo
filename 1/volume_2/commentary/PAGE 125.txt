Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death—the outer container's arising manner dissolves, and the inner contents' beings' life measure rising and waning downward—the sign of exhaustion. If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms. Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world, support-ground not existing, the vital point of no ground of return. Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut, now awareness itself is separate from death. Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment, difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not," therefore called "dharmata exhaustion"—the meaningful result.

The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable. Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the all-ground consciousness mind exhausted, and purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmata of the three doors of the all-ground part. Depending upon the dharmas of delusion, that luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmata, through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmata exhaustion."

Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going, the primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—not like vision as entity and characteristic. At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmata exhaustion. The dharma-possessor object and the dharmata's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor, the time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with all-ground.

The manner of exhaustion: gradual and instantaneous, from the two. Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure. Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmata manifestly at first.

Emaho! Moon waning, body fading—exhaustion is completion, not loss!
