You fortunate ones who have received the teachings! When all power is not complete at the final time, it is not complete [13817]. Therefore at this stage, your own ground's appearances are the four wisdoms preparation—since you are not liberated, power is incomplete. This is why we accept the four wisdoms preparation [13818-13819].

Then comes seeing the spontaneously accomplished precious jewel appearance. Until the actual result is complete, the four wisdoms appear as qualities, but all-accomplishing wisdom's own face does not appear because only the seed power exists, so the five wisdoms' aspects appear [13820-13823].

Upon the four wisdom cloths are four thigles, upon which are small thigles in mandala arrangement like stacked spheres [13825]. Above them is a round light like a peacock umbrella—this is the five wisdoms' dharmadhatu appearance [13826-13827]. This is the seed of spontaneous accomplishment appearing at this time. This is called "Vajrasattva's path of the heart center" [13829].

The essential instruction for remembering: All these appearances—without altering your awareness, recognize them as your own display and rest evenly in "ce-re" [13831-13832]. Like a golden hook drawing forth the heart-blood, relying on the mother's essential instruction, you become certain of your own display in the bardo and are liberated.

Emaho!
