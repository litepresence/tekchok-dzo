Listen well, you who would traverse the path! [8960-8966] Since these displays have no external existence, the Vajra Rosary Tantra says: "The body beyond conception is unimaginable." This has some meaning you intelligent ones should understand. Since it is easy to understand naturally that body appears, there is no contradiction in speaking of external space where dharma-expanse and lamps appear—this is taught for those deluded ones who need easy understanding.

[8967-8983] The fifth point concerns the special definitive key point: through the crucial point that rigpa never changes, though initially straying from the base and deluded in samsara, rigpa never becomes bad. When the lama introduces it and you lose it, wandering lost, later when decisive certainty arises there is joy. The rigpa when first lost and when deluded have no good or bad difference. Unmeditated rigpa and when meditating have no difference. Rigpa when wandering and when gone have no good or bad, just like rigpa when sleeping and waking, going and staying have no difference.

[8984-9006] Yet there is good and bad in how things appear, like dream happiness and suffering—therefore the path is practiced with reference to that. But do not hope the essence improves, for rigpa never changes or transforms. From Rangshar: "Emaho! This precious jewel nectar—I, the precious jewel, was lost from beginningless time. Then I wandered in suffering's wilderness. This precious jewel nectar is not found by searching. Self-arising from self, realized by self. This precious jewel nectar—lost without knowing, found with knowing. Loss shows things have no characteristics; finding brings joy's radiance. The time of finding and losing understood as one without difference."

Emaho!
