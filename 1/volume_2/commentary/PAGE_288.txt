Ah, precious disciple! Then in river's bed sent [14041-14060]—from death reversal, no doubt, Narag-kan.

Fourth: death-point appearances [14061-14080]—elements each dissolving, channel-wind disturbance signs: earth dissolving into earth sign—body heavy, unable to rise; water dissolving—mouth and nose's water flows out then dries; fire dissolving—body's edges' warmth departs, radiance and vitality withdraw; wind dissolving—layered breath arises, body's strength departs.

Sun-Moon Union [14081-14100]: "Earth into earth dissolving, likewise water, fire, wind, each self-dissolving, thus comes to person's body. Earth self-dissolving, body heavy, food not taken, rising and going strength all gone. Water into water dissolving, mouth-nose's water flows. Likewise fire into fire, mouth-nose very dry, body's edge warmth departs. Likewise wind into wind, breath rough rough, limbs shake, eyes also upward turn."

Fifth: crucial pointing-out instructions [14101-14120]—three: best, familiar space-awareness self-placed; middle, transference training; last, depending on other conditions.

First [14121-14140]: yogin alone dying, if non-separation in clear light's appearance, at that time also not depending on others, self-appearing clarity from that nature unwaveringly placed. Body key posture, three or cross-legged or lion's lying, rigpa space-awareness directed, dying—at that instant upward zangthal liberation, no dharmata bardo.

Sun-Moon Union [14141-14160]: "Then that fortunate person's appearance self-clear, non-dwelling awareness self-place." Lion-posture aggregates: rigpa directed at eyes, mind slightly sky-path made; if space-awareness not changing, that person without bardo becomes Buddha without doubt. Dying breath also becomes slow.

Emaho!
