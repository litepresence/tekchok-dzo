Listen! You want to meditate? Then know the pitfalls! If your shamatha becomes one-sided—just blank calmness—that's an error. If you scatter and spread out endlessly, that's an error. If you don't find the depth-clear self-essence, that's an error. If you hold one-pointed like a peg stuck in wood, that's an error. In brief, anything other than meditation where awareness is self-clear, vastly liberated, grasping-free, self-dwelling—that's all error. Know this!

[3479-3486]
Thalgyur tantra says: "Meditation dwelling in the head—sense doors clear, mind-thought unmoved, consciousness itself practicing mind, outwardly practicing mind, not losing outward." See the subtle point? Your consciousness practices itself, not going outward, not sinking inward. Like a lamp in a windless room—steady, clear, self-illuminating.

[3487-3497]
This means consciousness isn't stained by appearance, appearance isn't manipulated by consciousness. Nature clear and lucid, not holding one-pointed like a peg—vast, clear, pervading, self-liberating, great pervasion. This is self-arisen wisdom meditation. From that: "Meditation's characteristic, appearance-manner—is characteristic empty-clear awareness. Nature nowhere mixed, grasping extremes ceased, dharmata's self-face pure."

[3498-3516]
Incidentally, the fault of not meditating: from that same source, "The fault of not meditating is samsara's characteristics manifestly appearing. Self and other, object and consciousness, words with view, focus with objects—afflictions bind to self. Buddha's path is lost, result's nature not known, dharmas-all-equal ground not existent, self-aware bound to three realms, with thought becomes downfall." Therefore, make effort in meditation!

Third, that intention: appearance-existence ground-relaxation dharmata arising. Before, whatever appears was made path through investigation of establishing ground. Here, elaboration having reached its limit, liberated into self-relaxation—able to dwell unmoving from the actual ground's dwelling manner. As Klongchenpa says...

Emaho! Don't fall into the four errors!
