Ah, you who seek truth! Sound's nature [11669-11682]—what the ear faculty hears. Distinctions: unpleasant, pleasant, and middling, but here the peaceful dharma-sound (long, slow, continuous) and wrathful thunder-sound (short, fierce)—called ur and thug.

Causes [11678-11682]: general cause is elemental; here arising from stability attainment. Result: sambhogakaya and emanating nirmanakaya. The peaceful sound [11683-11693] brings stability in seven samadhi days from peaceful kaya; wrathful sound brings liberation to wrathful kaya.

The five families [11694-11715] determine direction: from the east Vajra family, south Ratna, west Padma, north Karma, above Tathagata. Listen for the sound's direction when the yogin passes—it reveals the family of buddhahood!

The text quotes [11716-11719]: "From ur arises in seven days, from thug in fourteen days manifest buddhahood." Duration indicates intensity of recognition—fierce recognition, swift result!

Sound is not mere vibration [11720-11735]—it is the dharmata's voice, your own nature declaring itself. Like an echo that reveals the presence of a canyon, sound reveals the depth of realization. Those who hear with recognition are liberated upon hearing; those who hear without recognition merely accumulate causes.

Emaho!
