Listen here! You think posture is just sitting straight like a stick? Wrong! These three postures—hunched like a beggar, elephant-like, lion-like—are not about looking good for others. They're physical keys that unlock what you already possess. The nirmanakaya posture bends you toward asceticism, the sambhogakaya posture opens you to spontaneous completion, the dharmakaya posture makes you fearless as a lion. Don't just read this—sit! Feel your body shift as you try each one. Your body knows what your mind forgets.

[4548-4555]
The three bodies aren't somewhere else. They dwell in your heart right now, luminous and clear. When you make the gaze, you manifest what's already there. See? You're not building something new—you're uncovering what obscures. The cold body harmonizes with nirmanakaya, the hot with dharmakaya, the balanced with sambhogakaya. Feel your own temperature right now. Which one are you today?

[4556-4562]
Pay attention to this! If you don't bend the body, the channels stay blocked. If you don't raise the gaze, wisdom won't dawn in the sky of your mind. This isn't theory—it's mechanics. Like a snake's limbs that only appear when it coils, your wisdom only appears when you arrange the conditions. The ordinary way of sitting won't work. Dawn comes only when posture is precious to you.

[4563-4565]
So you ask—why only three postures? Why not one, two, a hundred? Because three afflictions bind you to three realms, and three liberate you. Body, speech, mind—three doors out of prison. More than three? You get lost. Less than three? Incomplete. Three is the number of completion, the way things actually are.

Emaho! These three postures are your body remembering what it never forgot.
