Listen carefully! Present happiness-suffering and all appearances [12801-12820] arise from previous karma; this life's karma produces future's appearance. Those who did bad karma before have incomplete faculties, crippled limbs, ugly form, dependent on others here.

Those who accumulated good karma [12821-12850] have clear faculties, beautiful form, pleasing to see, wealth, enjoyments, always self-controlled and powerful. Future birth too depends on present's good-bad conduct.

Those gathering collections, practicing generosity, ethics, etc. [12851-12880], are born in happy realms' higher worlds with high status. Those patient, faithful dwell beautiful, heroic, central lands, honored by all, unharmed by others.

Previously respectful to gurus [12881-12900]—now meeting true gurus, practicing Dharma, born in good lands with all desires. Previously respectful to Three Jewels [12901-12920]—now well-ordained, celibate life complete, practicing sublime vehicle Dharma.

Previously trained in hearing, contemplating, meditating [12921-12950]—now great wisdom, Dharma topics immeasurable, hearing-contemplating-meditating accomplishing self and others' benefit. Those who did evil—born in lower realms, even higher realms have incomplete faculties, little merit, suffering.

Emaho!
