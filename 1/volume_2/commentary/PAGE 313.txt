[13368-13393]
All elements dissolving into the jewel-ground of Ratnasambhava's sign—unable to rise from declining strength. Appearance dissolving into the ground of infinite light-display—power of complete perfection lost, intent unclear. Dissolving into the ground of completed practice—lamp-appearance ceases! Inner water dissolving into outer water's sign—cannot hold water, like this!

Emaho! Each element knows its way home!
