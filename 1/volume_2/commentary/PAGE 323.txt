**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [13727-13754]

Now the text explains how rigpa enters into the light. You rest naturally in non-conceptual meditation [13727], and all appearances become radiant and clear. From the heart's light rays, countless subtle spheres (thigles) arise [13730]. Then from your heart center, light rays thin as a horse's tail appear, coiled like thread, and you perceive all these deities dissolving into your own body [13731-13732]. This is called "awareness entering back into light" [13733].

Listen well! At this time, practitioners must remember the supreme method—like a mother embracing her child [13734].

The third topic concerns the appearances of the four wisdoms preparation dissolving into union wisdom. There are two aspects: how the appearances arise, and how to remember the essential instructions [13735-13736].

From the heart, about four finger-widths above, appears a subtle light of four colors—blue, white, yellow, and red—intertwined like a thin thread, thin as a horse's tail, shooting up into the sky [13737-13738]. With the eye of wisdom you gaze at it, and from that subtle appearance it expands greatly, becoming distinct and separate—a blue cloth large or small, within the range of your sense faculty, not mixed with other colors, appearing before you [13742-13743]. This is the appearance of dharmadhatu wisdom [13744].

Emaho!
