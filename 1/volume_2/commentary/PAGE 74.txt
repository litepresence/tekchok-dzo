Listen closely! Daytime and nighttime—do you think they're different? In this practice, you don't distinguish them. Your meditation experience isn't clearer in daytime, nor more obscure at night. Gradually, the difference dissolves like mist in morning sun. This is the sign that day and night are uniting in your experience.

[3435-3439]
Now Longchenpa gives you the second meaning: the instruction of the ocean-relaxation method. Think of the eye's clear fluid—call it an ocean. When you place awareness there without moving, that's the ocean-relaxation. Don't meditate, don't meditate—beyond the act of meditating, just gaze without blinking. That's the crucial point! Like a fisherman watching the water—alert but not tense.

[3440-3445]
Here's the example: in the ocean, reflections of planets and stars appear—spread out, relaxed. They appear as objects but can't be grasped as objects. The ocean isn't stained by them. For the yogi, outer appearances arise in the eye's path. They appear in the face of appearance, but at the moment of appearing, consciousness doesn't lose itself. Not stained by outer appearances, consciousness doesn't grasp inner appearances. Appearance and consciousness relate but are cut free—grasping and grasper liberated into non-existence. This is called spontaneous meditation of the six aggregates.

[3446-3453]
The actual meditation has two aspects: gathering wind-mind at the point, placing consciousness in its own place. As Thalgyur says: "Meditation is mind settling upon; moving cuts outer-inner; grasping and grasper cease." See? When mind rests in its nature, the division between inside and outside dissolves like salt in water.

[3454-3464]
From the Tantra Without Letters: "Primordially unmodified, self-arisen relaxation. Appearance not changed, mind not modified. In dharmata sky dwells the intention. Dharmakaya wisdom abandons all thought. Without doing movement, that's meditation's intention. Not holding focus directions, like planets arising in ocean—grasping-free clarity doesn't cease. That's how the intention dwells."

[3465-3471]
At that time, the intention of dharmata relaxation is complete. As Klongchenpa says in the Six Expanses: "Upon the pure-existing mind itself, the five door-objects are self-pure, like undefiled clear water—all appearances complete in their own place."

[3472-3473]
Second, cutting the place of error: If the six aggregates cease and you become without memory—that's also a pitfall. Don't get stuck in blankness!

Emaho! The ocean reflects all but holds none!
