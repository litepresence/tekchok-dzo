Listen closely, diligent practitioner! [9103-9116] The display of perfected wisdom, the display of pure dharmata with rigpa, the matured bindus' display of bodies mandala reaching measure—then again acting upon dharmata's exhausted display. From the Thalgyur: "From wisdom-perfected display and dharmata's pure display, three displays perfected then exhausted." At this time body, speech, and mind's measures, each self-display when seen, self-matured signs complete, exhausted measures clearly appear.

[9117-9128] Thus practiced, through diligence excellent ones in three years, middling in five, lesser in seven years eleven months six days—seeing dharmata's exhausted display, liberation into light body occurs. From that very text: "Through great or small diligence, by days, months, and years, each reaches completion at their time, from unchanging time reaching each measure." This is the extremely crucial secret key point of practice.

[9129-9142] The third point concerning definite day-night rotation has four aspects: closing the gate of memory by gathering faculties at the crucial point of the channel, wisdom arriving at the vase through gathering the object of knowledge, morning wisdom clearly showing, daytime pressing down displays suppressing signs. Though explained before, here as thod rgal's support summarized—practice and there's slight difference from before. Daytime with elephant gaze look directly at manifestation, deluded displays self-liberated thus signs suppressed. Nighttime place awareness upon the lamp of empty bindus, when bindus expand awareness' clarity also expands, when they diminish awareness becomes finer, finally becoming aimless, rest evenly without mental fixation or recitation.

Emaho!
