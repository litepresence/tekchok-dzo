Three bodies familiarized samadhi experience, not arising simultaneously—all these gradually mind-object. First samadhi obtains nirmanakaya. That time to own knowing, previously unseen dharmas, without thinking mind dawns. Own instruction conventional words, without holding mind spread. For person with fortune, dharma taste mind satisfied, body six seven days, existence not felt, above ground risen, mid-space going experience, own object arises. Rigpa uncontrived placed, thus obtains own nirmanakaya."

"That passed rigpa unmoved, sambhogakaya also, own knowing stream, self-appearance effort all free, experience thus arises. Previously unseen light appearance also, gradually who sees, this too sambhogakaya trained. Fortunate yogin with family, knowing self-clear experience clear, self-clear mind familiarized, inner clear change mind not mixed, follows things' trace mind not following, worldly activities mind not appearing, by this sambhogakaya obtained."
