Ah, precious disciple! Who god signs arisen [14961-14980], tam syllable's connection, breath with number also; eleven with awareness trained; crown tam syllable contemplated; awareness outflowless eyes drawn; likewise vase crown's upper, wisdom water-stream purified, god's places emptied, that obtains human birth-place.

Asura signs possessed [14981-15000], kem syllable's connection, breath with twenty number; right armpit itself right also, kem syllable expert placed; awareness that gathers, breath with thrown; likewise vase armpit's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, asura places emptied, that proceeds likewise.

Who human signs [15001-15020], a syllable's connection, breath with gathered number; mouth's upper a syllable; awareness crown drawn, twenty-one; likewise vase mouth's upper, wisdom water-stream purified, human birth higher proceeds.

Third: subsequent purification [15021-15040]—explained before as consciousness transference, here similar. These rituals, though extensively taught in other tantras, here the great perfection's crucial points condensed—recognize thus.

All these bardo instructions [15041-15060] are the vital heart-essence of the path. Like a mother bird teaching her chicks to fly, these instructions guide the dying through the in-between. Do not take them lightly, fortunate one!

Practice these while alive [15061-15080]—then at death, recognition will arise spontaneously. Like a warrior who has trained with his weapon, when battle comes he acts without hesitation. Train now, liberate then!

Emaho!
