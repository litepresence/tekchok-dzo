View accumulation! Ten perfections become view and support.

Outer five: giving, ethics, patience, diligence, concentration, wisdom—these accumulate merit through cause-effect. Inner five: aspirations, power, prayer, skillful means, primordial wisdom—these accumulate wisdom through hearing teachings.

Merit accumulation: outer practices create positive karma for future happiness—like planting seeds that grow into trees. Wisdom accumulation: inner study creates understanding for liberation—like cleaning a dusty mirror.

View accumulation: both types of perfections together create inseparable merit and wisdom—this is perfection.

Support accumulation: mantras, prayers, conduct, aspirations become supporting conditions that ripen faculties—like sunlight nurturing plants.

Then, all perfections as view: When emptiness is seen, all ten perfections become natural display of awareness, no longer separate practices.

Emaho! Practice and view become one taste!
