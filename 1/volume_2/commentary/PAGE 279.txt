Ah, precious one! In short [12951-12970]: previous life's actions, present life's body-mind patterns know; future birth where, present's conduct depends. Samadhiraja Sutra: "Previous actions—look at present body; future where—look at present mind."

Thus thinking [12971-12990], abandon non-virtue, practice virtue, always rest mind in sublime Dharma—nothing else can help! Daughter Jewel Sutra: "Here father, mother, relatives, friends, dependents cannot be refuge; sons, daughters not saviors. Without virtues, no other world-protector exists."

Advice to King [12991-13010]: "Time comes, king must go; enjoyments, friends, relatives won't accompany. Wherever beings go, karma follows like shadow."

Second [13011-13030]: contemplating certain death causes, always produce renunciation and weariness. Though impermanent, grasping permanence, attached to this life—confused beings! Fall into birth-death's river without knowing liberation; experience various sufferings without ceasing.

Separated from true spiritual friends [13031-13050], no path-showing protector, Dharma-eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness. Thinking thus, this difficult-to-obtain leisure, joyfully produce eager mind or practice Dharma.

Emaho!
