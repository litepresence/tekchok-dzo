Look here, fortunate one! [8925-8931] When this turns inward and self-liberates, there is no diminishing. The teachings speak of these displays existing in the external sky, but understand this is provisional—like looking into a mirror and seeing a reflection. Though others cannot see your empty-forms because obscured by your body, your own seeing through the pure light-channel of the eye reveals what shines within, just as one sees the sun shining inside a house through a window.

[8932-8940] Even with eyes closed you see these empty-forms—this proves they exist within. Therefore, though the bodies and displays do not exist in external objects, they appear as if they do. Like seeing your face in a mirror, so too the heart's awareness displays its radiance in the inner mirror of pure light-channel. Even though not in the external object, you see them internally—this is the quality of pure perception's light-channel. If you understand this intermingling of inner and outer as mere display, you are a person of wisdom born from the expanse of Dzogchen, a yogin of spontaneous liberation like myself.

[8941-8959] Join this understanding with scriptures worthy of confidence. From the Sengé Tsal Dzogchen Tantra: "All these bodily displays are not external objects' display. Like a young woman seeing her own face in a clear mirror, so too does awareness' display arise as bodies in the dharmadhatu sky. Seeing your own natural state is not something existing externally—it appears manifest through pure perception." The five wisdoms' colors display to the senses through effort, then effortless outer displays move through wind's power. From the mirror-like displays come two and threefold aspects. Through constant familiarity, five-colored lights from mere circles appear cut-off—this is the measure of vision.

Emaho!
