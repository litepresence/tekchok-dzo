Listen carefully, earnest practitioner! You may ask: Is example introduction blocked? [10173-10210] Not at all! Some use sky as example, some use different elements, some use light, some use divine bodies!

The common vehicles generalize, some portions consider only impure-pure nature. But here, in this Secret Heart Essence meaning, no matter how many examples are shown, there is no place to deviate, no place to grasp!

For those who see awareness directly, examples are merely helpers. Then through essence, expansion, and dissolution manner - like a primordially pure crystal, great openness, pure like a crystal above - this is suitable and complete!

Vajrasattva's indicative example: white color, moon's color - through example, sign, and meaning three, awareness is demonstrated! Birthless, ceaseless, open expanse is shown!

This introduction suitable to sense-powers is experience-taking with hand guidance! Without deviation place, without stagnation place! Ear lineage and hand gesture together, confidence and superimposition cut, word and meaning connected!

This is called supreme introduction, the Buddha's Dharma lineage place! From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, relying on difficult introduction of vajra place!

Now the yogin's signs determining sequence: past life purification signs, how body-speech-mind abide; present path-entering signs, how the three doors appear!

Emaho!
