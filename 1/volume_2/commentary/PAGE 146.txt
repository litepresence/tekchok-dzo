From Rangshar: In Dzogchen Ati Yoga, no view, no meditation, no conduct! Yet well-taught, keep in mind!

Without accomplishment, power-display, without aspiration—unmade, spontaneously complete, that very meaning! Doer and doing—where are they?

Conduct-less dharmata self-arisen this—falling nowhere, like space! Not existing, emptiness alone. Not non-existing, true bliss body. Not made, self-arisen, thought-free!

In Dzogchen Ati Yoga—what meditation dharmata exists? Without releasing or placing dharmas! Without meditating or meditated, freed from extremes!

Grasping-free mind's stain what? True awareness stainless! Stainless pure dharmakaya—in it, nothing to meditate, nothing meditated!

See? You're trying to polish a mirror that's already clean! Just recognize it's clean!

Emaho! Spontaneously complete—nothing to do!
