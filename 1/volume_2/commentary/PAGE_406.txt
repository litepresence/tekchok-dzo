Listen carefully! Sentient beings, wandering in confusion through samsara, are cut off from the lower realms. From the unsuitability of tamer and tamed, from the wisdom abiding in the basis, they appear as external manifestation. Arising as beings' benefit throughout samsara's duration—this comes from the natural force of compassion, clear depth of knowing awareness perfect and complete.

From the Thalgyur:

"From dharmakaya emptiness' nature,
Wisdom knowing perfectly complete,
By force appears to sentient beings.
Without this, samsara-nirvana cut off—
Knowing awareness clear.

From self-knowing clear self-nature,
Natural force of compassion itself,
Not ceasing, without cessation."

This is the profound mystery! Compassion isn't something the Buddha creates or generates. It's the natural radiance, the spontaneous expression of the wisdom mind. Like light radiating from the sun without the sun "trying" to shine. The wisdom basis naturally appears as benefit for beings.

Without this force of compassion, samsara and nirvana would be cut off—there would be no connection between the ultimate nature and relative appearance. But because this wisdom-compassion is spontaneously present, the benefit of beings appears naturally, effortlessly!

Second, the five wisdoms of sambhogakaya: possessing their own individual characteristics. For Vairochana, dharmadhatu wisdom is primary, the other four as retinue. For Akshobhya, mirror wisdom is primary. For Ratnasambhava, sameness. For Amitabha, discriminating. For Amoghasiddhi, all-accomplishing wisdom is primary—the remaining four as retinue for each. Thus twenty-five wisdoms, and from dividing those, immeasurable. Gathered, they condense into five.

From the Self-Arisen:

"Wisdom divisions thus:
From twenty-five essences,
Gathered, condense into five aspects."

How do they condense? From the Thalgyur:

"Sambhogakaya wisdoms possess characteristics,
Mirror—because pure actual objects,
Clear reflections of samsara-nirvana.
Sameness—because without direction/border.
Discriminating—shows sense-fields' objects.
All-accomplishing—not by effort.
Dharmadhatu—because without difference."

This is the mandala of wisdom! Each Buddha family has its primary wisdom and four supporting wisdoms. Five times five equals twenty-five. But it doesn't stop there—these can be subdivided infinitely, or gathered back into the five.

The key insight: these aren't separate things. Mirror wisdom reflects everything clearly without judgment. Sameness wisdom sees the equality of all phenomena. Discriminating wisdom knows the details. All-accomplishing wisdom acts without effort. Dharmadhatu wisdom is the space in which all appear.

They're all aspects of your own awareness! Stop thinking wisdom is something distant or difficult. It's the nature of your own mind.

Third, the two wisdoms of nirmanakaya: entering to pervade all knowables. Knowing however many are included in appearance. Knowing however things are included in emptiness. Knowing all relative phenomena distinctly, without mixing, teaching according to the faculties, elements, and latent tendencies of immeasurable gatherings of trainees.

This is how the Buddha works in the world—not with one method, but with infinite skillful means. Knowing what each being needs, how they understand, what their capacity is, and teaching accordingly. This isn't effortful; it's the natural display of wisdom-compassion.

Emaho! The three kayas, the wisdoms, the compassion—all complete!
