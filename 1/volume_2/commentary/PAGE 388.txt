Listen carefully! Some say at the time of perfectly manifest Buddhahood, that primordial purity is nowhere established as anything, so there's no body and pristine awareness dharma either, and no ground-appearance. Some others say: Body and pristine awareness actually abide, and without that, it would follow that result Dharmakaya and pristine awareness were not obtained, or obtained then lost.

Refuting these has two parts: Reasoning: According to the first position, it would follow that Buddha lacks pristine awareness, so own-benefit and other-benefit don't arise—because no difference from empty space without anything. According to the second position, it would follow that Dharmakaya exists like substantial entities with marks, coarse material, like some substantialist proponents—because form self-characteristics are established, and aspect pristine awareness actually established, so no difference from conceptions.

Emaho! Longchenpa is destroying two extremes! Some say Buddha is just emptiness—nothing at all. Others say Buddha is a solid, permanent thing. Both are wrong! Buddha is beyond existence and non-existence, beyond permanence and annihilation. Like trying to describe space—can't say it's a thing, can't say it's nothing!

Scriptural refutation: From Six Expanses: "Without two knowable pristine awareness, what difference from material things? Or else, completely empty, this itself only changes." Thus. From Illuminating Lamp: "Thus without pristine awareness aspect, difference from external empty space exists. Therefore from ground pristine awareness pervades. Without pristine awareness, empty and different, nothing becomes. If coarse pristine awareness exists, equal to conceptions." Thus.

These scriptures show: without the clear aspect of awareness, Buddhahood is just nihilism. But if you make it a coarse, graspable thing, it's no different from ordinary thoughts. The middle way is recognition—luminous, clear, yet ungraspable!

Third, correct system: In primordially pure own-face, nowhere established as anything, transcending existence-nonexistence extremes, body and pristine awareness established like crystal. In that state or expanse or aspect, extremely subtle pristine awareness ground-appearance aspect abides triply stacked, like light inside crystal—though not directly visible object, abides as ground-appearance. Those three pristine awarenesses exist, becoming source of all body and pristine awareness. Dharmakaya unmoving, yet form body and activity appearing to trainees capable of appearing—this capability arises from that crucial point. If not thus, Buddha would be one taste with...

This is the key! Your nature is like a crystal—clear, empty, yet containing the potential for all light. The three wisdoms are always present, just not always manifest. Recognition doesn't create them—it reveals what's always been there!
