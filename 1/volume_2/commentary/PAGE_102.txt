Listen here, you who wander in samsara! Longchenpa reveals something crucial: the three poisons and three realms are not separate things - they're the same energy appearing differently! When you're driven by desire, you take birth as a bird in the desire realm. When aversion rules your mind, you manifest as a snake in the hell realms. When ignorance clouds your awareness, you become a pig in the animal realm.

Don't think these are literal reincarnations! This is happening right now, in this very moment. When desire dominates your mind, you're creating the desire realm through your own attachments. The "bird form" isn't something you become after death - it's how your experience shapes itself when desire is chief!

Look at the details: "action and doer, speech chief" - when desire runs the show, everything becomes about doing and having. "Body ripening time, speech delight" - your physical existence matures through enjoyment, your speech revels in expressing what you want. This is the first samsaric wheel - the pattern of wanting and grasping.

[4576–4590]
Now the poison of aversion - the snake realm! "Latency producing, mind chief form" - anger comes from latent tendencies, but it takes over as the ruler of your mind. "Ripening time, mind changes many" - when aversion dominates, your mental state becomes unstable, jumping from one irritation to another. "Intellect change conceptuality great" - oh, how aversion loves to analyze and judge! It creates elaborate theories about why everyone else is wrong.

"Speech not-delight, sleep delight comes" - anger doesn't enjoy expressing itself positively. It finds pleasure in withdrawal, in dullness, in the stubborn refusal to engage. This is the hell realm - the contraction of awareness!

[4591–4596]
And ignorance - the pig form! "Moving-desire, body strength great, body coarse" - ignorance is characterized by crude, unrefined grasping. "Grooming delight" - the pig finds pleasure in wallowing in filth. Isn't this exactly how ignorance behaves? It delights in remaining stuck, in not knowing, in the comfortable mire of concepts.

But here's the master's teaching: each poison has its liberation posture! When you're caught in desire, the Sambhogakaya posture - the enjoyment body - shows you how all desires are pure displays of wisdom. When aversion burns, the Dharmakaya posture - the abiding nature - reveals that anger has never moved from emptiness. When ignorance wallows, the Nirmanakaya posture - the activity body - demonstrates how even pig-like delusion can express buddha-nature!

Emaho! The three poisons are the three kayas in disguise!
