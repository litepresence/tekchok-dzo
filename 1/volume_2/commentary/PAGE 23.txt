[1158-1173] Fifth, method of examining emanation-kaya: Teaching Dharma with benefit and happiness to common beings through Buddha's emanation, the two benefits appear somewhat similar. From Self-Arisen: know the method of examining emanation—even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere. In crown ushnisha, one cluster of hair curling to the right; in heart center, form of vajra; birth in royal caste or high caste. Conducting conduct suitable to whatever, following whatever is spoken, not establishing one's own preferred desires. Deed, effort, and grasping naturally nonexistent, clearing doubt of whatever beings desire. Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya.

[1174-1176] Although these marks exist showing that as emanation, whether others are suitable emanations or not is uncertain. With pure mind produced, one should strive to tame one's own continuum.

[1177-1187] Second: individually explained, enumeration of five kayas—essence, etymology, appearance, division, meaning application. First, essence: blazing glory of complete marks and exemplary features. From Self-Arisen: essence possessing marks and exemplary features, nature holding individual marks.

[1188-1204] Second, etymology: called 'kaya of five families' because appearing as kayas of five different families. Third, appearance: appearing as father-mother kayas and wisdom. From Self-Arisen: appearing in manner of father-mother two—aspect holding father is kaya of method, aspect holding mother is kaya of wisdom. Method without cessation, wisdom without change.

Emaho! Five kayas complete!
