Delusion was never real. From the very beginning, dharmakaya is like sky—vast, open, uncreated. But clouds of beings suddenly appear and obscure it. Clouds aren't separate from sky. They arise from sky, dissolve back into sky. You're like that—appearing suddenly, thinking you're real, but you were always sky.

The five afflictions—desire, anger, ignorance, pride, jealousy. They seem real when they blow through. But like clouds, they have no solidity. They arise conditioned, dissolve conditioned. Knowing this, how could you be bound? You're watching the weather. The weather can't trap the sky.

The ancient text keeps exclaiming: great wonder! This mind has no dwelling place, no going place. Six doors of perception all enter, yet nowhere to enter. All-gathering ground, yet nowhere to gather. Circling ignorance has no power to change anything. Afflictions have no root, no basis. Everything appearing is like clouds, like echoes.

How does an echo work? Sound against rock, bouncing back. The singer sings, the sound arises. But the tone itself never moved. Sound just appears, conditioned by conditions. Dharmas are like that. All of them.

Great wonder at the basisless! The path isn't adding something—it's recognizing that nothing was ever stuck. Primordial wisdom doesn't need an antidote because there's nothing to cure. Going and coming awareness, end without end, dwelling without dwelling—all great wonders when you stop trying to pin them down.

Rest in that wonder. The wondering is the rest.
