[1376-1404] Now listen, dear one! The third topic: the manner of appearance in the intermediate state. In the dharmata-bardo, five wisdom lights dawn; from the final of the twenty-one sense-powers, the dharmata-bardo sets. But in the existence-bardo, beings rely upon impure light within themselves. There too, resonance dawns as six individual types.

From the Self-Arising Tantra: six impure delusion lights—at the final of the final sense-power, white dawns and yellow dawns, red dawns and green, likewise dark-blue dawns, flickering in a smoky manner. This is that impure delusion light. Thus when lights are summarized: delusion-light for unrealized beings and wisdom-light for realized ones—these two gather.

From that itself: light distinction is beyond thought! Pure wisdom light and impure delusion light are to be regarded. The expanse possesses light, thus body-wisdom-appearance is clear. Even in this delusion-time now, the appearance of five elements as five colors has not gone beyond—all beings dwell in that very nature! The Buddhas' exhaustion-meditations, rays, measureless bodies emanate, and also arise from that.

[1405-1419] The third meaning: dependent wisdom distinction in three aspects—essence, distinction, and distinction of certain terms explanation. First, essence: primordially uncompounded awareness. From expanse-rigpa, primordially-pure dharmata-emptiness nature dawns. From the Rigpa Rang-shar Great Tantra: Kye-ma! Secret-lord, certainly retain—non-dharma wisdom is self-arisen, all dharmas within become born, from that wisdom arising.

Second, distinction: the five wisdoms, when with defilement time, included by being-mindstream, are called naturally-spontaneously-accomplished wisdom.

Emaho! Wisdom lights in bardo are none other than your own mind's display! Recognize the pure, don't follow the impure. The difference is only recognition or non-recognition!
