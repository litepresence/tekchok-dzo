Hear the final words of encouragement! [12656-12680] You who have read this far, you have great merit. These teachings are the secret essence of the great perfection, precious beyond measure. Cherish them!

[12681-12705] In degenerate times, when beings are caught in distraction and delusion, this practice of thod rgal is like a lightning path. Swift, direct, and powerful—it can carry you to awakening in one lifetime.

[12706-12730] Do not delay your practice. Life is short and uncertain. The time to practice is now, while you have the favorable conditions of a human body and the precious teachings.

[12731-12755] Every moment of recognition is a moment of liberation. Every moment of delusion is a moment of samsara. Choose recognition! Rest in your true nature!

[12756-12780] The displays of light are beautiful, the pure lands are magnificent, but do not be seduced by them. They are merely the path, not the destination. The destination is beyond all display—the primordial purity of your own awareness.

[12781-12805] When you rest in that primordial purity, there is nothing more to do, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve. You are already complete, already perfect, already awakened. This is the great secret.

[12806-12830] May all beings who encounter these teachings recognize their own nature and achieve liberation. May the light of wisdom dawn in all hearts. May the benefits of this practice spread throughout the ten directions.

Emaho!
