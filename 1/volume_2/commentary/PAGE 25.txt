[1250-1265] Listen here, dear practitioner! You wander through six realms chasing phantoms, yet the lamp of self-light has never stopped radiating within you! Look—though it abides in your very heart, you do not know your own face. Like a blind man sitting before a mirror, you see nothing!

Consider how this light manifests: In humans, it appears as example and sign. In gods, clearly visible. In demigods, subtle and refined. In animals, merely dwelling in their own abode. In hungry ghosts, flickering like a dying flame. In hell beings, small as a sesame seed—yet still present! Six lights abide thus, though beings do not recognize them.

[1266-1269] Mark this well! That light within the heart is merely resonance itself. Do not confuse it with the light of karmic ripening that gods see from afar—that is contaminated virtue-result, not the self-light of heart-essence! One is like the moon's reflection in water; the other is the moon itself.

[1270-1302] Now, for those trained in the path, appearance manifests in nine aspects—hear them! Abode: Five self-lights spontaneously accomplished in the heart, five colors' thigles, five kayas as father-mother mandalas. Path: arising from distant visibility. Field: empty as sky. Body: upward appearance of five kayas and four wisdoms. Eye: self-arisen wisdom lamp knowing its own face. Essence: all-clear wisdom without ceasing. Example: like crystal. Time: appears in this life if experienced; naturally arises in bardo. Liberation place: original primordially-pure jewel secret cavity.

Understand this, fortunate one! What you seek outside has never been apart from you—not for a single instant! The nine aspects are complete in your own heart-mandala right now. Stop searching!

Emaho! The self-light of original purity!
