[1250-1265] Second: individually explained, appearance manner—three aspects: to those not trained, to those trained, in intermediate state. First: although light radiantly abides in oneself, to six realms not knowing their own face, self-light of lamp exists in subtle portions. From that itself—in humans, exists as example; in gods, visible; in demigods, exists subtly; in animals, merely in own abode; in hungry ghosts, flickers; in hell realms, like sesame grain—thus six lights abide.

[1266-1269] That light is merely tone existing inside heart. By nature, light of ripening-result latencies exists in gods as distant visibility; it is light of contaminated ripening-result virtue, not self-light of heart essence.

[1270-1302] Second: manner of appearance to those trained—nine aspects: light abode, path, field, body, eye, essence, example and simile, time, liberation place. Abode: in heart, thigle of five spontaneously accomplished lights, in center of five colors, five kayas abiding as father-mother cluster mandala, five elements, five aggregates, five kayas, five families, five wisdoms, abiding in purity of five grounds; from four appearances, seen when measure arrives. Path: arising from distant visibility. Field: empty sky. Body of light: upward appearances of five kayas and four wisdoms. Eye: through self-arisen lamp of wisdom, knowing one's own face and moving to expanse. Essence: all-clear, non-ceasing wisdom. Example: like crystal. Time: if experientially taken, can appear in this life; time when intermediate state naturally arises. Liberation place: to first primordially pure jewel secret cavity.

Emaho! Nine aspects of light appearance!
