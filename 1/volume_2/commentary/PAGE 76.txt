Hear Samantabhadra himself speaking! "Upon mind without thought, ungrasped, unceasing, self-appearing—know the object-face of self-clear awareness. This is called the intention of great ground-relaxation. I, Samantabhadra, teach this. Upon mind without thought, self-dwelling, spontaneous, appearing—this is called the intention of the four sounds returning to their source. I, Samantabhadra, teach this. Upon mind without memory, self-pure, appearing—this is called meditation of pure grasping. I, Samantabhadra, teach this."

See? The primordial buddha isn't somewhere else—he's your own mind when you stop messing with it!

Fourth, the result: afflictions self-liberated without needing to apply antidotes. The aspect of affliction's self-purity dawns as wisdom. All various appearing dharmas of seeming-reality self-clearly liberate into dharmakaya's nature. As Klongchenpa says in the Six Expanses...

Emaho! Samantabhadra speaks from your own heart!
