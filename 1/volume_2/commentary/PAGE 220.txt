Attend to the crystal's teaching! [9555-9571] Relying on outer-clear light, know emanation body's light arising. From crystal base supporting, know base-abiding wisdom essence. Holding inner-clear characteristic, know characteristic-holding wisdom. Outer-clear all aspects knowing wisdom. Inner dissolving know all-knowing wisdom. Crystal's variegated display shows display-mode. Crystal's own essence shows natural state alone. Crystal with self-light shows rigpa's wisdom. Thus summarized certain symbol aspects: From Lamp Array Tantra—"From doctrine signs and whispered transmission, secret mantra meaning's measure arises. Through example know meaning, through signs gain certainty. Through meaning's essence decisive, three wisdoms abiding in base as seed. Through condition-arisen wisdom, seed's way ripens, ignorance's darkness dawns, knowable obscurations self-purify, unsought result self-seen."

[9572-9598] Understand these meanings in sequence thus: first, original universal base self-arisen essence body should be introduced. There essence, nature, compassion three abide—empty rigpa heart essence possessing thigle alone. Lama holds clear mirror, shows student, speaks thus: "Kuntuzangpo's clear light mirror this, similar examples establish nature. Realized meaning clear light introduction is. First Kuntuzang natural state introduction. Rigpa zangthal abiding like crystal. Rigpa non-conceptual clear like crystal. Rigpa lhungrub abiding like crystal. Rigpa unceasing directionless like crystal."

[9599-9616] Thus though five lights outer eye clear, inner clear nature, self-nature—white light too self-abiding inseparable, showing compassion. Crystal essence shows kadag three yet inseparable, showing thigle alone's meaning, understand how it abides. Then showing delusion base: crystal sun-rays held outward, inner light two shown outward, from base base-display arising time cause, itself one ignorance cause-condition, five-colored object, seeking all white subtle mind shown, first moving that light together arising.

Emaho!
