Look here! Volume Two begins, and don't think this is just more of the same words. Longchenpa is shifting gears entirely. Volume One established the ground—*kun gzhi* and *chos sku*—but now he's bringing you face-to-face with how everything actually manifests. This is where the rubber meets the road.

[5-8]
He's laid out the distinctions of alaya-ground and dharmakaya for you. Now he's turning to *rten 'byung*—dependent arising. But notice: he's not starting with some abstract philosophy about causes and conditions. He's starting with what's right in front of your nose—the elements themselves. There's the common way of understanding this, and then there's the deep individual nature of each element. Don't skip past this thinking you already know about earth, water, fire, wind, and space. You don't know them. Not yet.

[10-14]
Two types of arising, he says. Outer and inner. Right there, stop! Don't immediately think "oh, outer means mountains, inner means my body." That's the trap. Longchenpa is pointing at how the very same five elements appear both as the world out there and as the channels, winds, and essences in your own vajra body. They arise from *rang shar*—self-arisen. You didn't create them. They didn't come from somewhere else. They're the spontaneous display of your own nature. Feel that?

[15-20]
Listen closely now. The outer elements—earth, water, and so on—exist as the basis for the inner elements. They're connected, intertwined, inseparable. You can't have inner without outer, and here's the crucial point: neither samsara nor nirvana exist without depending on these two. 

Emaho! What does this mean? It means your confusion and your enlightenment both depend on these very same five elements. Beings wander in the confused expanse of the five elements, yes, but they possess the *self-nature* of the great arising. That self-nature isn't dirty or broken—it's the same nature that Buddhas realize as pure. The only difference? Buddhas dwell in the five pure elements without the solidity of fixation, without the stains. The elements themselves don't change—you do!

[21-31]
Pay attention to this distinction between great and small arising. The five great elements are luminosity-wisdom with five colors—the enlightened dimension of the elements. The five small elements are what you usually think of: solid earth, flowing water, and so on. But the pure elements? They're clear, warm, bright, cool, spacious, moving. These aren't poetic descriptions—they're the actual felt qualities when you recognize the elements as they truly are.

From the confused five elements, the five luminosities arrive in the expanse. This is key! The confused elements don't go anywhere. The luminosity arrives *within* them, meets them, transforms the meeting itself. Like the purity of spontaneously arisen appearance—it's not that you get rid of the appearance and replace it with purity. The appearance itself becomes recognized as pure.

[32-37]
Now he's breaking down the small arising further: arising-form and actual arising. Arising-form is what appears outside—yes, the ordinary earth, water, fire, wind, space you see out your window. Actual arising refers to the five qualities within your body—the thin, and so forth, that become the basis for the inner arising. Your very body is composed of the same five elements, arranged differently. Pure realms have their own five dharma-elements, each distinct. This isn't just cosmology—it's a map of your own experience.

[38-43]
Therefore—mark this word, "therefore"—all samsara and nirvana don't move from the expanse of the five elements. They never left. Before the five elements, there was no samsara, no nirvana. The elements are primordial. From the Self-Arisen tantra, he quotes: "Kye ho, Secret Lord, listen! The characteristics of the five arising—I show, you must understand."

Do you hear the urgency? This isn't academic. The tantra itself is saying: understand this! Not intellectually—directly. The five elements are not obstacles to enlightenment. They *are* enlightenment's display when recognized.

[44-55]
The great arising, the Bhagavan, exists as the nature of all beings. All beings of the three realms move in the expanse of the five arising. Before the five arising existed, no Buddhas, no beings—not even names. The five arising themselves are the mother-expanse. Not established from the five arising—not even one being exists.

Read this carefully! "Not established from the five arising"—does this contradict what he just said? No! It completes it. Beings don't exist *from* or *apart from* the five elements. They are the five elements, and the five elements are empty of inherent existence. The two types of five arising of beings dwelling therein—this twofold nature is what you must recognize.
