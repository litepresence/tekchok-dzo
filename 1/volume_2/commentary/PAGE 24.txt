[1205-1221] Fourth, divisions—two aspects. Division into five families: from that itself—family of Thus-Come, vajra family, jewel family, lotus family, karma family. Division into five kayas: Vairocana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.

[1222-1237] Fifth, meaning application—two aspects. First, meaning application of five families: from Self-Arisen—in meaning of rigpa, Thus-Come family; in meaning of reason, vajra family because without birth and death; in meaning of rigpa, jewel family because various arise; in meaning of rigpa, lotus family because faultless and pure; in nature of rigpa, karma family because actions complete.

Second, meaning application of kayas: Vairocana because rigpa-appearance without cessation; Vajrasattva because rigpa realizes two benefits; Ratnasambhava because knowing through simultaneous rigpa; Amitabha because seeing one's own appearance; Amoghasiddhi because realizing rigpa without birth.

[1238-1249] Second benefit: detailed division of tone and light—two aspects: showing general abiding manner, individually explaining appearance manner. First: five lights of great chief, abiding as great spontaneous accomplishment primordially. Inside jewel-heart like risen crest, in center of clear light channels, in tone of five lights, wisdom of rigpa abides. From Self-Arisen: that appearance of great wisdom abides in center of tsitta.

Emaho! Five families and kayas!
