[16614-16629]
Five families' pure realm appearances: pure by nature, self-clear appearance of five lights, engaging in great enjoyment as aspects of five wisdoms, free from all afflictions' pain.

These also, from the Ratnakuta:

"By self-clear pure sambhogakaya,
In five lights pure palace,
By speech of non-elaboration great bliss,
To five kaya families' retinues,
Non-entity pure dharmas,
From gathered five wisdoms mind, emerged,
Spread on tongue as pure light rays,
Also self-arisen six syllables,
Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen."

This is describing sambhogakaya—the enjoyment body of the Buddha. Not physical like nirmanakaya, not formless like dharmakaya, but appearing as light, as wisdom, in pure realms. The five lights are the five wisdoms. The teaching happens without words—through light, through wisdom, through spontaneous presence.

[16630-16639]
Sambhogakaya: because essence shows Dharma as symbols, without words, thus "unspoken." Trainees hearing the six syllables' self-sound is appearing as speech, like dream words. From the Longchenpa's Six Spaces:

"From his own mouth unspoken,
Like dream characteristic,
To retinue's bodhisattvas,
Appears in wisdom analytic mind."

This is profound! Sambhogakaya teaching isn't verbal—it's direct transmission through symbols, through light, through wisdom. The "six syllables" are the essence of all mantras, appearing spontaneously.

[16640-16663]
Fourth, extensive explanation of enumerations—from five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity.

Sambhogakaya's kaya: like empty-luminous rainbow.

Speech: like dream, trainees' self-appearance.

Mind: wisdom possessing characteristics, without interruption.

Qualities: complete in marks, signs, light rays' heaps; speech appearing as self-arisen syllables' appearance; mind become treasure of clairvoyance and oceanic samadhi.

Enlightened activity: turning measureless Dharma wheels without interruption.

From the Thalgyur:

"Sambhogakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects.

Kaya: appearance without nature,
Clear and clear-maker, awareness pervading.

Speech: self-arisen self-appearance,
Emanation-gathering aspects' wheel.

Mind: without stream, seeing,
Knowing potency and intention.

Qualities: perfect marks and signs,
Intention-clear clairvoyance perfect."

This completes the picture of sambhogakaya—not a physical body, but a body of light, teaching through symbols, benefiting advanced bodhisattvas continuously.

Emaho! Enjoyment body of wisdom light!
