From Great Dynamic Display Qualities Scripture: "Liberated by being free from extremes."

Reason: validated by one-known all-liberated reason. Knowing one free from extreme, thus appearance-concepts all liberated—no reference applicable anywhere.

Liberation mode: not abiding in existence extreme, liberated from nonexistence extreme. Not abiding in nonexistence extreme, liberated from existence extreme. Not abiding in both, liberated from both. Neither, liberated from neither.

Fifth: one liberation depending on peerless key, showing method and wisdom not dependent. One is Great Perfection single thigle free from elaborations. Liberated in that nature, all multiplicities' extremes empty.

One liberation peerless key has four: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode; example.

Understanding: one liberation not invalid—nothing unrecognized from one liberated as one. Therefore rigpa beyond primordially liberated or not terminology.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: all liberations not different—called liberation from one, nothing other. One itself is rigpa. Nothing other than self-knowing alone.

Scripture: from Golden Essence—"One alone liberated dharmata—multiplicity one taste."

Reasons: validated by one-known all-liberated. Knowing one as rigpa, all samsara-nirvana liberated.

Liberation mode: all appearance-awareness liberated by recognizing dharmata.

Emaho! One taste liberates all!
