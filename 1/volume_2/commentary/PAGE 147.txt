[6261–6313]
Listen here! From Six Spaces: "Extreme-free center objective-reference not, thought not objects not! Deity not mantra also existing not! Dharma not tagged all transcended! Enemy not friend also existing not! Body not sense-power vision not! Dharmas thought not vision! What not where holding not! Self not self's retinue also not!"

This is the ultimate! Nothing to hold, nothing to reject. Like space, it accommodates all yet remains unchanged. Your attempts to grasp this are like trying to catch the wind—futile!

[6271–6313]
Appearance mind, mind awareness, awareness dharmata—self-nature not-established! Thus exhaustion's meaning complete! Dharmata exhausted, all exhausted, appearance exhausted, mind exhausted, dharmata exhausted, spontaneously exhausted, meaning complete!

Emaho! Complete exhaustion into dharmata!
