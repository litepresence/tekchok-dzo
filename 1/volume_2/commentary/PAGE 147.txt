From Klongchenpa's Six: Without extreme, middle, no focus. Without thought, no objects! No deity, no mantra exists! No dharma, beyond all labels!

No enemy, no friend exists! No body, no sense appearance! Dharmas not seen by thinking! Where nothing, nothing to grasp!

No self, no my retinue! No expanse, no awareness body! No virtue, no karma ripening! No life, no cut focus! No accumulation, no accumulation object!

No buddha, no sentient being! No ground, no emptiness! From Samantabhadra's Mind Mirror: In bodhicitta heart, without error-obstacle—where error and obstacle to grasp?

See? All these things you worry about—they don't exist in the nature of mind! Like worrying about horns on a rabbit!

Emaho! Beyond all—spacious freedom!
