Listen well! Death-point bardo's appearance [12221-12240]: body's elements disturbed, experiencing outer body's suffering; mental events' path lost, experiencing inner mind's suffering; habitual grasping's dam burst, experiencing this life's appearance's separation though attached; remembering non-virtuous deeds, fearing fall into lower realms.

Grasping-fixation's attachment [12241-12260] remembers cherished supported body, fearing the collapse of the aggregates' fortress—who experiences this? One parted from bempo rig, dwelling in the suffering of fearing death.

Dharmata bardo's appearance [12261-12280]: aggregates' self-grasping support abandoned, kaya and wisdom's dharmata appears directly; karma and habitual patterns' connection severed, nature's samadhi dharmata is enjoyed; faculties' grasping objects emptied, self-appearing clear light dharmata is practiced.

Samsara bardo's appearance [12281-12295]: outer body's samsara, mental body with complete faculties moving without obstruction; inner mind's samsara, various thoughts moving and engaging; body-mind gathered samsara, moving without obstruction to all except two supports.

Two supports [12296-12310]: vajra seat accomplished through blessing, and mother's womb. Scholars generally identify the vajra seat as India, but here it is ka-dag's unchanging inner space, excellent place where all buddhas awaken, pure nirvana's door. Mother's womb is impure samsara's door, any of six realms' birth-places—not literal words.

Emaho!
