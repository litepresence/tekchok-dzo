From Tal 'Gyur: "This object key like this: cloud-free outer object empty, yogin sky bird path abides. Not separate from this dharmata."

Also: "Object appearing characteristic: sky blue limitless, light and color shape, five wisdoms self-appearing showing. Pure expanse lamp, thigle body and deluded appearance, nature itself and own-nature, nondual meeting-free appearing."

At this time, channels-inside wind moves, subtle thoughts sha-ra-ra arise, but no harm to direct meaning. Thoughts themselves cannot stand by themselves, liberated going along—like falcon catching prey flying. Scattered objects disperse, but unlike before chain link continuing, no distraction.

Karma and latencies not accumulated. Light meditation not destroyed. Dynamic display entered, wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.

Gaze posture restrained, thick thoughts self-ceased; thin subtle thoughts all self-liberated.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Intention unmoved from one. Appearance appearance's immediate clear, like face and mirror. Liberation that and that itself liberated. Knowing movement empty-release. Seeing-knowing-rigpa not different. That itself self-liberated. One known all-liberated, two three number extreme exhausted..."

Emaho! Self-liberation in direct seeing!
