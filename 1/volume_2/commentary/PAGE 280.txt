Listen, fortunate disciple! Though impermanent, grasping permanence [13051-13080], attached to this life's appearances—confused beings! Fall into birth-death's river without liberation; experience sufferings without weariness. Without true friends, no path-showing protector; Dharma-eye closed in ignorance darkness.

Contemplating certain death [13081-13100]: though obtained difficult leisure, this four-element compound aggregate certainly disintegrates—conditioned nature. Like bubble-popping aggregate, when will this destroy? Now on this unbroken support, do I accomplish liberation's sublime Dharma?

This life's dream-illusion appearance [13101-13120]—what does it accomplish? Ratnakuta Tantra: "No seat to remain on conditioned forms; stable life, death-time certainly comes. Six collections' objects appearing—no permanence. Person's memory-thoughts-feelings inexhaustible. Body's arising suffering without clarity."

Thus though impermanent [13121-13140], grasping permanence, attached to this life—I must not be thus! Whatever benefit to others, enemies tamed, lands taken, whatever done—all essenceless and deceptive. Look only at your own mind!

Mar-me-mdzad-ye-shes [13141-13160] stated: "Worldly conduct looking far—all done meaningless, suffering cause. Whatever thought doesn't benefit—accustom to looking at own mind!"

Emaho!
