Listen well, fortunate ones! With supremely pure body, touch the mind mandala of infinite Samantabhadra [14037]. With defilements exhausted body, touch past Buddhas' minds [14038]. With pure, touch present Buddhas [14039]. With extremely pure, touch future Buddhas [14040]. With supremely pure, simultaneously touch the minds of time-three-as-one Buddhas [14041].

Then mind clairvoyance: With ordinary self-purified mind, master the ten samadhis [14043]. With pure, master a hundred [14044]. With extremely pure, master a thousand [14045]. With supremely pure, master ten thousand [14046].

With form-liberated mind, transform the power of the four elements individually [14047]. With pure, shift beings' suitable abodes [14048]. With extremely pure, shift the abodes of the six realms mutually [14049]. With supremely pure, steal the display powers of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas [14050].

Thus for the six sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind—six for eye, three for ear, two each for the remaining four, making seventeen [14051-14059]. Counting four and four, sixty-eight is sense faculty clairvoyance, included in six internal divisions [14060-14061].

The second, mind-made clairvoyance six, are: pure vision purifying previous attachment [14063], pure vision of future delusion being exhausted [14064], pure vision of disciples' knowledge being complete [14065], pure vision of invisible becoming path [14066], pure vision of beings being completely perfected [14067], and pure vision of faculties being liberated from perversion [14068-14069].

Emaho!
