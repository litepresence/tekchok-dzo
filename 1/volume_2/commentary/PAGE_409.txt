[16960-16965]
From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the Tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection:

"The kayas of the Buddhas,
Speech and mind mandala,
Qualities and enlightened activity—
Appear as five."

Thus it is taught.

This is the summary verse. Everything that appears from a Buddha—the forms, the speech, the mind, the qualities, the activities—all five are spontaneously present. Not created, not made, not cultivated. Naturally manifesting.

[16966-16982]
Second, the detailed divisions of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. First, regarding kaya: essence, definitive terminology, division into three.

The essence of kaya: whatever is the Buddha-ground's support, without change or transformation. Definitive terminology: "kaya" because body is complete.

In the Buddha-ground, though there is neither body nor entity, names alone do not contradict. From the Ratnagotravibhaga (Dkon mchog sgron me):

"The dharmakaya is the body of the Victors.
By seeing, purifying views, one will know."

Just as it is said.

Here's the key point: Dharmakaya isn't a physical body, yet it's called "body." Sambhogakaya has no marks, yet it appears with marks. Nirmanakaya has no fixation, yet it appears in various forms. These aren't contradictions—they're the play of emptiness and appearance!

[16983-16995]
Divided: Dharmakaya free from elaborations; Sambhogakaya free from marks; Nirmanakaya free from fixation. From Tsal Dzog:

"Essence of kaya without change,
Definitive terminology of kaya possessing clear radiance,
Shown as divided into various aspects,
Possessing dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya.

Characteristic of dharmakaya free from thought,
Characteristic of sambhogakaya without clear cognition,
Characteristic of nirmanakaya showing various."

This is profound. Each kaya has its own characteristic: dharmakaya is beyond thought, sambhogakaya is beyond ordinary cognition, nirmanakaya shows variety. Yet they're not separate—they're three aspects of the same enlightened nature.

[16996-17007]
Regarding speech also: essence empty of sound, definitive terminology various Dharma heaps appearing in the expanse. Divided: the speech of great enlightened activity, appearing whatever tames whomever; Brahma's speech appearing as sixty branches; six realms' self-appearance and harmonious speech appearing according to each sound; beings' believing speech, sound satisfying the faculties; symbolic speech, making meaning understood through symbols shown; word-speech, afflictions purified through sound reaching trainees' ears.

These also are distinguished through the essential identity of nirmanakaya alone. For sambhogakaya, merely symbols. For dharmakaya, from unexpressible meaning-speech, appearance does not exist. The speech appearing as nirmanakaya is like the aspect of an echo.

Listen! Buddha speech isn't "someone talking." It's empty, yet it appears. It's like an echo—sound without a source. It appears in whatever form is needed to benefit beings. Sometimes as formal teaching, sometimes as ordinary conversation, sometimes as symbols, sometimes just as words. All are Buddha speech when recognized!

Emaho! The kayas, speech, and mind are complete!
