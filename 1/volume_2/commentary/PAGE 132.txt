The maturation connection! How ground path connects with vehicle and vajrayana.

First aspect: cause-effect emptiness and appearance—without grasping at ground's appearance, benefit others becomes easy, like child having wealth. This is highest conduct for ordinary beings.

Second aspect: ten stages from view and conduct: 5 perfections from conduct, 5 from view. Conduct perfections: giving, ethics, patience, diligence, concentration, wisdom. View perfections: skillful means, aspirations, power, primordial wisdom.

Third aspect: maturation's power to complete nine vehicles' paths—because it purifies both obscurations, like mountain spring pure.

Fifth aspect: seven lights—mahamudra's selection! Gradual vehicles with method: one light, one hundred thousand eons. Dzogchen: instantly accomplish, maturation arises.

Then maturation as ground path's preliminary—makes ordinary vehicles' ten stages complete through nine vehicles' maturation. This shows supreme path's incredible efficiency.

Emaho! What takes eons gradually, Dzogchen matures instantly!
