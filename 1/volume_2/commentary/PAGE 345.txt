You who wish to be free, understand! The three crucial points with citations:

From Talgyur: "Furthermore, dharmata essence: established as essence from nature. Since appearance mode is not one certain, entering paths are also different. With face, knowledge, and liberation seeing, entering, seeing, and habituation. From face recognition, own face. Confident heart is the place. Decided, confidence enters. Thus three's certain activity: essence complete, cause ceases" [14317-14328].

"Furthermore, dharmata nature explained: Here not one certain, whatever labeled thus appears. From various name bases, words and phrases' elaboration appears. From uncertain various names, meaning also empty of mere labeling. Since emptiness not established anywhere, nature pure thus appears" [14328-14337].

"Furthermore, dharmata compassion explained: Objects to be tamed various, taming forms also that many. From lineage and faculty displays, samsara-nirvana realization different. That itself placed as individual object is uncorrected meaning's intention" [14338-14344].
