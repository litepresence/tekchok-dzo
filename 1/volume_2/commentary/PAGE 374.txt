Listen! Bodhisattvas abiding there, bound by one birth, merely so. Lifespan five hundred fifty years. In that field, food and drink, merely thinking, satisfied. No phlegm diseases, no wind diseases, no bile diseases, no combined diseases. Various flowers offering to emanation body, extensively making offering, merely so. Those bodhisattvas, green color, merely so. Horses and mounts, green, merely so. Boys and girls' forms appearing, merely so. All without mind's conceptions. In that field, no three types of sentient beings. No six minds. No six afflictions. No ignorance. No four conditions included. No mind associated with ignorance. All free from conceptions, merely so.

Measureless palace retinue's qualities: Four corners of that measureless palace, four crystal jewel stupas nine stories high. Between them, golden bells, turquoise nets connected. Wind moves them, various sweet bell sounds arise. Four stupas, sun shines, connected by five light rays' hooks. Four directions, four peacock banners. Wind moves them, various pleasant and beautiful things arise. Such immeasurable qualities exist. That palace is five hundred yojanas north from here. Those born there bodhisattvas enjoy equally with form realm gods. North's emanation field similarly exists. Before those fields, in intermediate space, emanation body wrathful fields exist.

Emaho! These pure field descriptions aren't fantasy—they're pointing to the nature of your own mind! The "green color" means vitality and growth. No diseases means no suffering of samsara. One birth means immediate recognition without gradual stages. Don't look for these fields in space—they're the space of your own awareness when recognized!
