"Without practicing six perfections, collections complete at one time. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at naked rigpa, great emptiness all-even wisdom—wonder! All activities appear as ornaments. All abandoning and accepting liberated by view. Ha ha!"

"Look at emptiness of emptiness, great primordial emptiness—wonder! All Buddhas abide at home. By activity and meditation—falls, becomes! Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at nonempty emptiness, truly existent—wonder! Vehicle grasping at non-existence as self. Ha ha! Born, obtains unborn. Ha ha!"

[7245-7247]
When you look at your own rigpa nakedly, twelve laughs abide in the nature—effort self-pacified. One should turn to the great beyond-mind, dharma-exhausted.

[7248-7263]
Having explained Great Perfection's natural straightforward speech, one should believe in the mind's depth. Similarly, by the eight great marvelous words, one should turn to the meaning of samsara-nirvana dharma-exhausted objectless, from the Heap of Jewels:

"Emaho! Speech Vajra Heart Essence, you listen! By the key of your own rigpa free from birth and death—even for those who cut the life of billions of beings, and those always practicing ten perfections—no difference even a speck, thus have I, Samantabhadra, taught!"

"Vajra of all Buddhas' speech—by the key of no elaboration in dharmata, between the person always habituating to emptiness and the person not making emptiness mind for even an instant—no difference even a speck in becoming Buddha, thus have I taught!"

"Kye Speech Vajra! By the key of rigpa itself uncompounded, between the faithful one who did immeasurable compounded virtue and the person always delighting in taking life..."

Emaho! In the natural state, all extremes collapse into equality!
