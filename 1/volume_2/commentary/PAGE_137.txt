[5802-5804] Listen! From the pure arising of Dzogchen speech's own face—Dzogchen speech certainly liberated, entered into the resonance of purity, meaning free from elaboration inwardly decided!

[5805-5808] Speech like a small-pot child emerging from between rocks—like gone! From prajna wisdom's empowerment, compassion gathered, arising! Dzogchen, beyond speech and thought, entered as the controller of speech's meaning, extremely elaborate-free word—grasping's extreme cut!

[5809-5811] Speech arising like cliff forms—from channel-abiding letters entered into wind's bindu, arising! Dzogchen inexpressible meaning entered into speech's sound!

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your speech is not ordinary chatter—it is the spontaneous display of wisdom! When you speak from recognition, every word liberates. When you rest in the nature of speech itself, elaboration ceases. Do not try to make your speech special—recognize its natural purity, and it becomes vajra speech!

Emaho! Speech liberation through Dzogchen words!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
