When yogin's realization reaches measure, particles become partless, body stone-enclosed self-dissolves. Even slightly unreached, if surpassing others—even one srang heavy becomes light—rigpa dissolves into primordial purity.

Key point: from wide-open stone-enclosed pure rigpa nature's familiarization. Mind and its deluded appearance nonexistent, clear appearance aspect at that time self-pure in own face, mind and wisdom distinguished. Mind pure sees wisdom truth, mind bliss.

From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Seeing Buddha truth, Victor's child. Understanding thought, always bliss."

From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle: "Again, showing instruction of liberating by excellent realization—nineteenth sequence."

Having definitely established khregs chod meaning, now extensive explanation of thod rgal's key for purifying stone-enclosed into light body has two: how surpassing khregs chod; and explanation of special thod rgal itself.

First: surpassing by seven specialties—appearance light specialty; practice method connection specialty; self-appearance direct seeing specialty; body key channel specialty; appearance-illuminator gate specialty; seeing faculty specialty; experience increase-appearing specialty.

First: khregs chod cannot purify outer deluded appearance's ground stones rocks, making objects, depending on intellectual imputation of illusion groundlessness, depending on mind's consciousness collection dharmas, quickly not liberating.

Thod rgal makes five lights expanse rigpa appearance as object, no need for intellectual imputation of deluded appearance's namelessness, mind's dharma eye consciousness etc. self-ceased, training...

Emaho! Thod rgal's swift path of light!
