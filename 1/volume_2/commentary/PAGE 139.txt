Maturation and path! Four yogas complete all vehicles.

Yogacara's four paths: conduct yoga—accumulating merit and wisdom, like farmer sowing and harvesting. Mantra yoga—mantra recitation, samaya binding, magical powers, like calling a king who responds. Mandala yoga—vast perfection, Buddha-field mandala, magical emanation mandala. Nirvana yoga—direct realization without rebirth, like waking from dream.

Dzogchen's four yogas: primordially pure—ground, path, fruition spontaneously accomplished. Natural—no practice needed, like sun already shining. Single—relying on ground only, one lamp illuminating all. Perfection—ordinary vehicles' ten stages complete naturally, one meditation accomplishes all paths.

Maturation means: All vehicles reach fruition—conduct yoga practitioners become buddhas gradually, mantra yoga practitioners become rainbow bodies, mandala yoga practitioners become mandala deities, nirvana yoga practitioners realize nondual awareness.

Dzogchen's unique advantage: All four yogas complete in a single meditation—like a garden where all plants bloom simultaneously.

Emaho! One meditation, four paths, one fruition!
