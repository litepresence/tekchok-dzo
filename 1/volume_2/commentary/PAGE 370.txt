# Commentary on PAGE 370

**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [15414-15450]

My heart-sons and daughters, this completes the profound instructions on the completion stage of Dzogchen!

The text describes the five Buddha realms and the central wrathful realm where even those with dull faculties can attain liberation. These are not mythological locations but the natural display of enlightened mind. When recognition occurs in the bardo, one naturally abides in these pure fields.

The key point throughout all these teachings is recognition (ngo shes). Whether you are:
- A practitioner with sharp faculties who recognizes instantly in the clear light
- A medium practitioner who works through the four wisdom preparations
- Or a dull faculty practitioner who needs to reach the natural emanation fields

All can attain liberation if they recognize the nature of their own mind!

The "shooting star" analogy appears throughout—the sudden flash of recognition that liberates instantly. Don't think you need eons of practice. An instant of pure recognition is enough.

The twenty-one faculties represent the full spectrum of sentient beings' capacities. Whichever describes you, there is a path. The teachings are exhaustive so that no one is left out.

Remember:
1. All appearances are your own display (rang snang)
2. Recognition liberates (ngo shes grol)
3. No recognition, wandering continues (ma ngo 'khyams)
4. The nature is originally pure (ka dag)
5. The display is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub)

Train now in recognizing the nature of mind in this life. Familiarize yourself with the clear light in meditation and sleep. Then when death comes, you will recognize the clear light of death as your own nature, and liberation is certain.

This completes the commentary on Volume 2, pages 321-370, covering the bardo teachings, the spontaneously accomplished visions, the four wisdom preparations, clairvoyance, and the natural emanation pure fields.

May all beings recognize their own nature and attain liberation!

Emaho!
