Ah, you who seek liberation! The signs of sambhogakaya ripeness [10968-11017] manifest as powers: flying through space, passing through mountains, diving under earth, floating on water without sinking. But listen—if you lack confidence in the inseparability of space and awareness, these become mere sorcery!

The nirmanakaya signs [11018-11025] are even more amazing—spontaneous teachings flowing from your mouth, understanding texts you never studied, speaking words of Dharma that accord with beings' capacities. This is truly the lion's roar of speech!

See the bodily signs [11026-11043]: strength surpassing youth, grey hair turning black, wrinkles smoothing like a field after rain. And compassion [11044-11057]—previously absent, now arising from the depths for beings' welfare, willing to give body and limbs.

When these arise, you have touched the nirmanakaya. This is not mere imagination—it is your own nature manifesting! Like a lamp whose flame naturally rises upward, these signs arise naturally from recognition of your true face.

The text warns [11058-11077]: one who possesses these signs but lacks confidence in dharmadhatu and rigpa—the elements will self-exhaust but this is not true liberation. Do not be like a merchant who displays his goods but has no wealth!

Emaho!
