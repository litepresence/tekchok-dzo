There's not a fraction of Dharma in these—same as worldly people! Examine medium and best ones like this: if you haven't died like this, you're not a true yogin!

[13175-13184]
There are four ways of dying like a deer, lion, dog, or child—these are the medium yogin's death-manners. Those who like to die without conditions go to secluded places to die. For example, like a deer mortally wounded, going to a cave where people don't roam, or an empty valley, or a forest edge, or a hermitage—dying there without anyone seeing is a sign of being free from fear of anything!

[13185-13192]
Dying like a dog means, for example, like a stray dog whose owner is unknown, dying in a ditch, or a marketplace, or a road, or a shop. If the yogin dies like that, it's a sign of cutting attachment to places and abiding in dharmadhatu! Also, dying like a child without knowing whether dying or not dying—if the yogin passes from delusion without needing to calculate, without fear of death-circumstances, death-place, or death, without joy at not dying, just passing ordinarily—this is a sign of deluded appearances subsiding!

[13193-13203]
The best yogins' death-manners are four: like a dakini, vidyadhara, fire-mass, or sky. When the supreme yogin departs without a body, like a dakini whom nobody sees at death, this is the sign of becoming a buddha without bardo! For the benefit of demonstrating to others, when a vidyadhara goes higher and higher, going with body into space with sound and light for all to see—like inconceivable emanations performing inconceivable benefit, like the great yogin Lerab Lingpa!

Emaho! Four ways to die—four gates to liberation!
