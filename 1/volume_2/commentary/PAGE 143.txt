Listen! Beyond focus and thought—liberated and awakened. In the nameless expanse without directions, I rest!

Nothing to look at, no looking. No viewer. Looking doesn't see. Nothing to meditate, no meditation. Beyond meditation. Meditating doesn't liberate.

Nothing to analyze, no analysis. Analysis not needed. Analyzing is pointless effort. Nothing to accomplish, already accomplished. Nothing to do, no doer.

See? You're searching for what's already found! Like looking for your glasses while wearing them. Stop looking, stop meditating, stop analyzing—just rest in what's always been!

Emaho! Beyond all effort—already complete!
