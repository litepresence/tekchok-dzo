Listen! Explanation of two accumulations— merit and wisdom. Two approaches: gradual and direct. First from approach of three new schools: They accumulate merit through benefitting beings, accumulative wisdom through hearing-teaching; through hearingteaching for six hundred million eons they perfect. Two accumulations of merit and wisdom complete then buddhahood.

Direct approach: accumulating merit through benefiting beings and accumulating wisdom through hearing teaching happen simultaneously! Emptiness directly realized and matured—through that benefit others spontaneously accomplish.

Thus gradual path—merit and wisdom separately—takes eons, direct path—both simultaneous—spontaneous maturation possible. Actually both methods lead to fruition, but direct path's benefit greater like child picking up jewel vs. child discovering later.

Then showing dominance of direct path: With faith in supreme vehicle, bodhicitta spontaneously arise in one instant. Three types—kingly, teacherly, ordinary bodhicitta. Kingly bodhicitta—accomplishes six million eons collections in one instant. Teacherly bodhicitta—ten million. Ordinary bodhicitta—million.

From Flower Ornament: "Once bodhicitta arises in a single thought of mind, all collections from beginning purified." So use your time wisely—direct path works if you have confidence!

Emaho! What takes eons gradually happens in an instant!
