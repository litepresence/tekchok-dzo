[4235-4240] Listen! Voice good-bad difference explained. Briefly, six beings' voices. Mind's mindfulness speech expresses. Here purpose two types: supreme and common divisions.

[4241-4249] Thus relying on speech's various expressed, three realms samsara continuity ceases. From Supreme Empowerment Tantra: "Fortune possessing, six families' voices, each suitable expressing, six beings' wheel ceases!" As above explained, moment's effort engaged. Great effort, that itself attachment reverse. Ordinary, that itself and appearance all equal, carefree recognition arises.

Do you see? Six beings' voices! Express suitably! Wheel ceases! Recognition arises!

Emaho! Six voices ceasing the wheel!
