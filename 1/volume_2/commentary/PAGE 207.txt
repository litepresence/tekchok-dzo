Listen, you who seek the nature of mind! [8880-8884] Here lies the method of thod rgal, the path of lamps and light. You gaze upon the bindus of light that arise from the vajra-strings of your own awareness—like a bird swiftly taking wing, they appear in an instant. Do you see? This very self-display is your own rigpa's play.

[8885-8890] If you strike these displays with recognition, they dissolve like deer swift to flee. Rest undistracted upon their meaning, and they circle like bees to nectar. When you truly look at your own display, it stands like a mirage—flickering, yet without substance.

[8891-8898] Do not be distracted by their outer form, and they become but tremors and flickers. Deeper still, undistracted from their meaning, they become like coals half-concealed—neither fully seen nor extinguished. Thus, if you gaze intensely, you perceive neither coming nor going, only light displaying itself.

[8899-8906] When you stabilize upon this meaning, you see the lamp of empty bindus. Looking directly at these, you perceive bindus with bodies. Undistracted from their meaning, deluded displays resolve into sambhogakaya forms. All these bodily displays are but illusion, rainbow, and magical display.

[8907-8924] Resting intensely upon them, day and night become one—like the eyes of a fox, seeing equally in darkness and light. Thus is your own mandala-display. Yet know this: these empty-form rainbow lights and bindus do not exist in the external space, though fools believe they do. They arise from within your body's pure light-channels, seen inwardly through the eye's pure light-channel. The heart's radiance spreads everywhere—now is the time when the base-display dawns. Knowing your own face, rest naturally in your own radiance, and through this you will see what lhun grub luminosity truly is.

Emaho!
