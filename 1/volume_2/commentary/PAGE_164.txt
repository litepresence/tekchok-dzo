Listen here, you who cling to views! Longchenpa is showing you the progressive introduction—face-introduce mind to empty, then appearance to mind, then empty to awareness. Each step completes the previous. When you recognize appearance as mind, mind becomes complete. When you recognize mind as empty, happiness spreads through that emptiness. When you recognize empty as awareness—ah! That's dharmakaya itself, non-dual with space.

But watch out! Some hear "awareness itself and space are non-dual" and they attach to the words, grasping at some self-characteristic. They think they've got it conceptually. Don't be like that! This pointing is not the moon itself.

[6963-6972]
This teaching has three aspects you need to understand: intended basis, purpose, and actual logical problems. Why? Because the words "appearance is mind" are provisional—skilful means, not ultimate truth. They don't approach the heart-essence intention of the Nyingthig teachings.

The intended basis: Longchenpa said these words provisionally, to guide those who grasp outer objects as truly existent. From the Self-Arising Tantra: "Sometimes show appearance to mind." See? Sometimes—not always, not ultimately. This appearance-is-mind view is designated only to stop attachment to outer objects. That's the purpose. Nothing more.

[6973-6981]
Now the actual problems with this view—listen carefully! If appearance truly IS mind, then mind would have color and shape, because eyes see colors and shapes! And if appearance, mind, and empty awareness are all mixed together as one substance, then:
- Awareness would be deluded (ridiculous!)
- Appearance couldn't be seen by eyes (but it is!)
- Mind wouldn't be deluded (but ordinary mind IS deluded!)

Three contradictions from treating them as one thing! This distinction was explained before—don't think you can liberate yourself by just doing "appearance is mind" yoga. It's a step, not the destination.

[6982-6994]
From the Self-Arising Tantra, the Buddha himself said: "Appearance-mind yoga—all arise from my mind. If mind itself is realized, what is there to do? All expressing that word—I said not liberated."

Even the scriptures refute this view! If mind doesn't exist, appearance wouldn't exist either—yet it does. When mind ceases, appearance would cease at that same time—yet it doesn't. And appearance exists even when there's no mind—further proof this view has problems.

There are five occasions when mind doesn't exist, explained in the Middle Extremes...

Emaho! Don't get stuck in the provisional—keep moving toward the ultimate!
