[1944-1963]
Now listen to this! Longchenpa is describing the marks of a suitable vessel for Dzogchen teachings. You might think he's going to list the qualities of some high-born lama from an elite family. But look what he says—man or woman, doesn't matter! Any suitable one. This is the first teaching: Dzogchen doesn't discriminate.

[1944-1958]
He's giving physical characteristics: coarse limbs but good coloring, white conch-like teeth, slightly red pupils in the eyes, great hair that coils to the right and is dark-colored, small body with little need for respect from others, ordinary outer conduct, words that come spontaneous and natural. When such a person speaks, whatever they say is authentic. This person can teach the Great Perfection instructions.

But don't get attached to these marks! These are signs of a natural vessel, not accomplishments to achieve. If you're running around checking your hair in the mirror wondering if it coils right, you've missed the point entirely.

[1959-1973]
Now here's where it gets radical—Longchenpa says when these marks are complete in one person, even if they're from the butcher caste, or prostitute caste, or sweeper caste, any low-caste whatsoever, give them this secret instruction essence! Even if they have no material means, if they prepare what they can and give completely without holding back—this secret essence of three instructions—examine their caste and color and teach them.

After I parinirvana—after I pass into nirvana—this secret instruction, this essence again, thus teach to the definite king. To those persons who can teach, give the instructions above.

Do you hear this? The lowest of the low, the outcasts, the untouchables—they are suitable vessels if they have these marks. Dzogchen is completely egalitarian. Your birth, your caste, your social standing—none of it matters. What matters is whether you're a natural vessel for the teachings.

And what are the real marks? Not the physical ones! The real marks are: ordinary conduct, spontaneous speech, no need for respect or recognition, authentic expression. These are the marks of someone who has recognized their nature.

Emaho! The secret instructions are for everyone.

[1974-1990]
Second, regarding the definite manner of how to practice: there are two methods of conduct—the beggar's manner of practice and the deer-like manner of practice.

First: Abandoning your own country, going to foreign lands, making it so that no one knows your name, your good or bad qualities, what you know or don't know, disguising yourself as ordinary, living by begging for food and clothes, going a little distance from the town or to an isolated place or to inns and so forth, practicing without ostentatious display.

At this time, not boasting of your own qualities and name is the sign of having no pretension. Not making inquiries about others' gurus and teachings and so forth is the sign of having confidence in your own instructions without doubt.

Listen to this carefully! This is the way of the hidden yogi. You leave everything behind—your name, your reputation, your knowledge, your ignorance. You become nobody. You beg for your food. You live simply, not in the middle of town but on the outskirts, or in isolated places. And you don't show off! You don't let people know you're a practitioner. You don't boast about your qualities. You don't go around checking out other teachers and comparing lineages.

Why? Because if you're truly confident in the instructions you've received, you don't need to look elsewhere. And if you haven't realized the nature of your own mind, no amount of pretending will help.

This is the way of the sage—not the scholar, not the famous lama, but the hidden practitioner who has truly given everything up. Can you do this? Can you let go of your identity completely?

This is the path of the beggar—the true poverty of the Dzogchen practitioner. Not material poverty necessarily, but the poverty of ego, the poverty of needing to be someone special.
