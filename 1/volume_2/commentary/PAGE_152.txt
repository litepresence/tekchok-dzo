Stop grasping at both sides. That's the whole path right there.

No increase means no birth. No birth means no death. No death means no evil in actions. What's left when you remove all the edges? Nothing to protect. Nothing to destroy. Just clarity shining through itself.

The text says it plain: the pair of existence and non-existence itself is non-existent. You're arguing about whether the shadow is real while ignoring the light that casts it. Both sides are conceptual traps. The Buddha didn't teach existence. Didn't teach non-existence. Pointed at something beyond your concepts.

How could beings be born if they're pure from the beginning? The question assumes beings exist to be born. But beings are like illusions—appearing without solid basis. You think you're real because you suffer? Dreams feel real too, until you wake.

If mind had conditions, it would be destroyed. But mind isn't destroyed in deep sleep. Isn't born when you wake. It just changes mode—like a lamp turning down low. The flame doesn't die. It just becomes harder to see.

The cloud example is perfect: clouds appear in the sky but aren't in the sky. They gather, dissolve, leave no trace. You see them, point at them, name them—but they were never separate from sky. You are like those clouds. Appearing in awareness, not separate from awareness, leaving no trace when you dissolve.

Your memories aren't real either. You remember yesterday's dream as if it happened—feel happiness finding the jewel, holding it tight. Then you wake and nothing was there. Right now, reading these words, you're doing the same thing. Holding thoughts as real. But after you die, after this life dissolves, what remains?

Nothing to find. Nothing to lose. The search itself was the mistake.

Rest in the sky. The clouds take care of themselves.
