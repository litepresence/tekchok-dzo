Listen, fortunate one! Thus we have journeyed through the signs of the three times [15081-15100]—the path appearances, the maturation signs, the bardo instructions. All these are condensed from the sutras and tantras, the pith instructions of the victorious ones.

The four visions of thodgal [15101-15120]—direct crossing to the spontaneous presence of the dharmakaya. Like a mountain climber who finally sees the peak through the clouds, the practitioner sees the kayas directly. Not through gradual steps but direct perception!

Spontaneous liberation [15121-15140] means just this: without abandoning confusion, it is purified; without blocking thoughts, they cease; without training duality, it is resolved. Your own nature is primordially pure—like a lotus rising unstained from mud.

Dharmata nature [15141-15160] is not somewhere else. It is this very awareness reading these words, hearing these sounds, thinking these thoughts—yet free from grasping. Like the sky that holds all clouds yet is never touched by them.

The thigle expands [15161-15180], pervades, dissolves into itself. This is not annihilation but the great perfection—where ground, path, and result are inseparable. You have never been separate from the buddha-nature; you only forgot, like a rich man who dreams he is poor.

Now remembering [15181-15200], recognize! This is the crucial moment. Do not postpone liberation to some future life—seize it now, in this very breath, this very thought. The door is open; walk through!

Emaho!
