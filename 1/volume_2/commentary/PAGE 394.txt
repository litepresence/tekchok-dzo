Look at these verses from the Sutras! "The Sage's unique qualities, the eighteen explained, and the knowledge of all aspects—this is called Dharmakaya." The thirty-two marks and eighty excellent signs—this body, for the Great Vehicle's enjoyment, the Sage's Sambhogakaya is asserted. "Whatever benefit for beings in samsara equally performed—that body is the Sage's continuous Nirmanakaya." Thus it is said!

Emaho! The Buddha's qualities are not decorations—they're the natural expression of recognition! Like the sun's rays aren't separate from the sun, the kayas aren't separate from awareness. Longchenpa is quoting the Sutras to show the common vehicle's understanding before revealing the uncommon Dzogchen view.

Divided into five bodies: Body of Manifest Perfect Enlightenment, abandonment-realization liberation-perfected peaceful attainment. Body of Unchanging Vajra, unchanging without transformation from primordially pure expanse. Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—five. From Self-Perfected: "Five bodies, five pristine awarenesses." Thus it is said. From Self-Arising: "Five bodies of unchanging meaning abide." Thus. These divisions and others are immeasurable—enough elaboration!

Don't get lost counting bodies! Whether two, three, four, or five—it's all describing aspects of your own nature. Like describing a jewel by its color, clarity, cut, and carat—different aspects, one jewel!

Second, specific explanation of the nature of three kayas: establishing meaningful connection and explaining contextual meaning in two parts. First has three: General presentation of attainment mode. Specifically explained as being result. Removing contradiction with explaining as path-appearance. First: From essence's ground-appearance appearing as three kayas, shown as attained through power of purifying three gates' stains to be purified. From Thal 'gyur: "Furthermore, the result stages: Dharmakaya by mind's activity, Sambhogakaya obtained through speech's form, Nirmanakaya by body." Thus.

These are cause-result of what is to be purified. As spontaneously accomplished by nature, knowing that attainment through causes and conditions is impossible—know this!

See? The purification isn't a manufacturing process—you're not building a Buddha from parts. It's removing obscurations from what's already perfect. Like cleaning a mirror: the reflection is already there, you just remove the dust!

Second: From Mu Tig Phreng Ba (Pearl Garland): "Result three kayas, five pristine awarenesses." Thus. From Vajrasattva Heart Mirror: "Know that all result dharmas are three kayas, irreversible." Thus. Third: If someone says explaining three kayas as path-appearance contradicts...

Longchenpa is about to resolve an apparent contradiction. Some might think: "If the kayas are already perfect as the ground, how can they be a path we traverse?" Watch how he elegantly shows that these aren't contradictory but complementary perspectives!
