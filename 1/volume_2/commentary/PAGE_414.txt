Look at this image Longchenpa paints! Just as in the clear night sky, the moon (*ri bong 'dzin zer can*—the one holding the rabbit, i.e., the moon with its rabbit-shaped mark) radiates light, and the constellations fill the mandala at the center, causing the kunda flower groves to bloom—just so, this text radiates wisdom light!

The hundred rays of the heart essence (*snying po'i 'od brgya pa*) illuminate the sky of intelligence, the hundred-fold array of primordial wisdom's clear radiance. This is what you've been reading—not mere words, but light itself! The excellent path of the vajra heart essence becomes visible, causing the lotus of good fortune's intelligence to bloom.

Don't you see? The Dharma isn't a book you read—it's light that illuminates your mind. When you encounter these teachings, when you really let them in, the lotus of your own wisdom nature opens. That's the point of all of this!

From the grove of lotuses of the supreme vehicle's heart essence, these various self-liberated yogis are born. Having taught the meaning of luminosity-heart essence, the Stainless Light Ray Thousand (*dri med 'od zer stong ldan*)—this is Longchenpa himself speaking through his composition—has gone forth.

All the key points of the secret nature, without exception, he has shown directly and unmistakenly to those with fortune. Klong chen rab 'byams bzang po—Longchenpa's name, "Vast Expanse Good Infinite"—he is the one who taught this. Tshul khrims blo gros bzang po (Longchenpa's full ordination name), in this manner, in this very year—he proclaims it!

This is the master's seal. He's not hiding. He's saying: I, Longchenpa, composed this. I stand behind it. The teachings are authentic, direct, complete.

[17279-17282]
To those dwelling now and those coming in the future, to those fortunate ones who follow in later generations—with these key instructions of ultimate meaning (*mthar thug don gyi gnad*), with these intimate oral instructions (*gdams zin*), strive in practice! Apply yourself with diligence!

This isn't a casual suggestion. Longchenpa is looking through time, speaking directly to YOU, centuries later. He's saying: Don't just read this—practice it! The instructions are here, complete. What are you waiting for?

[17283-17290]
The secret treasury is extremely vast. The tantras, scriptures, and oral instructions are numerous. The vajra treasury is deep and difficult to realize. Therefore, this supreme vehicle treasury, gathering all their meanings, is precious.

Having pleased the glorious protector, the holy guru, these profound treasuries are gathered here without error. The ocean-vast expanse of scripture, reasoning, and oral instruction—this place profound and vast is supreme and exalted.

Longchenpa is telling you: I didn't make this up. This comes from the vast ocean of the Buddha's teachings, the guru's blessings, the profound treasury. This is authentic transmission, not intellectual fabrication.

[17291-17294]
From now on, do not show this to those without fortune. Do not discuss these uncommon philosophical positions in gatherings. Do not alter or change these words!

This is the seal of secrecy—not to hide the Dharma, but to protect it from misunderstanding. The teachings of Dzogchen are powerful. In the wrong hands, they become objects of debate, intellectual games, or worse. Keep them sacred. Preserve them purely.

[17295-17298]
This treasury is entrusted to the glorious consort of mantra (*sngags kyi bdag mo*), to the great lay practitioner of the planets Rahu (*gza' yi dge bsnyen chen po rA hu la*), to the protector Damchen Dorje Legpa. Protect it! Guard it as the command of the Buddha!

These are the protectors of the text. In Tibet, texts are entrusted to dharmapalas—protectors who ensure the teachings remain pure and available to suitable recipients. This is how seriously Longchenpa takes this work.

[17299-17302]
If in this there are errors, omissions, additions, or discrepancies in the source text—let the blood of their heart play as a festival of joy! Let their breath be cut off, their vitality stolen, their eyes and hearts cast on the ground!

Strong words! But this is traditional—protecting the text from corruption. Longchenpa is saying: May anyone who distorts these teachings face the consequences. This ensures the purity of the transmission across generations.

[17303-17306]
By the ocean assembly of the oath-bound guardians of the vidyadharas' command, bless those fortunate ones who practice this! Having completed all wishes and desires, may they awaken to Buddhahood in the primordial ground!

This is the final dedication. Not just for the author, but for you, the practitioner. May you be blessed. May your practice succeed. May you realize the ultimate nature, right where you are, in the primordial ground of being.

This is the end of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle. What a journey! Don't let it end here—let it begin here.
