Listen, you who seek truth! Third: reversal methods [13881-13910]—special fields gathering collections, elements' dependent connection wheel, deceiving demons with ransom—three reverse even exhausted life. Sun-Moon Union states: "Signs arisen in body, death-deceiving ritual explained. Person reversal action begun: own guru, sangha, gathering special field, pleasing with gifts and feasts, these rituals begun."

Elements' sounds balanced [13911-13940]—tala leaf, elements' five wheels, four calculations navel aureole included, earth-water-fire-wind-space wheels five made, colors distinguished by elements. Navel spokes five, each own five syllables, aureole ali's groups surrounding.

Thus wheels written [13941-13970], offering, praising, confession, each desired prayer. Navel elements' deity contemplated, syllable's number recited and stabilized. Then in kapala sealed, these wheels placed, five-colored cord swastika bound.

Wood, water, fire, earth [13971-14000], different types' breath, all mixed with meal and relics, form body one cubit. Five faculties' syllables written on paper, placed inside. This cures exhausted elements.

If demon-grasped [14001-14020], person's age-years past measure, color changed, own stains cloth-piece, likewise elements' substances, mixed with meal made form. Cotton, silk, feathers decorated, that form; harmonious torma likewise.

That form finally [14021-14040], person's age-years yoga around, blessed, these words spoken: "Take, take, powerful ones! Thirst, attachment, fixation, memory, grasping, thought, touch—release, pacify, liberate!" These words three times spoken.

Emaho!
