Third: learning sources—two sections: outer, inner. Outer includes four philosophical systems: Buddhist and non-Buddhist with three divisions each. Both count donkey eons after hearing Buddha's name but don't realize emptiness—great familiarity appears but takes donkey eons. Why? Instructions don't ripen—stuck in conceptual region like iron in darkness. Dzogchen's instruction piths four: manure field spreader, dream master, knife sharpener, gem expert, feast preparer, boatmaker, etc. These rely on preliminary collection—if collection incomplete, full path and result both obstructed.

Inner includes thirteen approaches in Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions—Buddha taught for those whose minds don't ripen through emptiness: through self-liberation through non-delusion, through non-self-lens, etc.

Dzogchen surpasses all—doesn't rely on philosophical systems but directly arrives at nature.

Emaho! Philosophies are donkey eons in disguise!
