Attend to this, practitioner! [9002-9010] That loss and finding occur within self-rigpa's own state, never separating from the wheel of self-rigpa alone. Like a king who lost a jewel in his treasury—when lost, there was suffering because the jewel was missing. Though joy and happiness expanded when found from the treasury, both remained unmoving from that one treasury. Similarly, samsara and nirvana's dual appearance arises from rigpa's state—the expanse of dharmata's vastness realizing the supreme wish-fulfilling gem's nature is certain as secret words.

[9011-9037] The second main point teaches lamp practice in three parts: preliminary conditions of the place, main practice of lamp-gazing method, and how displays arise from that. For preliminaries: abandon all this life's activities, please the sublime lama, and dwell in a secluded dark retreat house with the three unmoving practices. Meditate completely on the lama yoga and pray from the heart. From the Thalgyur: "To gaze at the lamp thus—devoted ones detached from samsara's mind make offering to the lama and give. Abandoning all samsaric connections, dwell alone in secluded places or charnel grounds."

[9038-9042] The second has two aspects: gazing at the letter AH and entering the clear light. For gazing: sit cross-legged, gaze with thumb and finger pressed together at the red clear round light bindu, and practice. Do many short sessions. Releasing the finger-thumb effort, gaze openly; gazing again to see displays is called dharmata's direct display. From that very tantra: "With own thumb and finger, press the lamp of empty bindus. Whatever arises from that pressing is dharmata's direct display."

Emaho!
