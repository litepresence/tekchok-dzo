You there—if there is no body remaining, the deceased has twenty-one days, and especially at each seventh day you must apply the ritual with concentrated meditation. Or do seven sets of seven days. At that time, teach them the path too! Explain the various Dharma teachings. Whoever possesses these three complete rituals—no doubt about it, they will certainly obtain the result!

[13016-13024]
For those who like elaboration, as explained in the Self-Arisen Perfection, you do the mandala of the six realms, the location recitation, food offering, and so on. But for those without elaboration, the above ritual itself is sufficient. According to the sponsor's resources—best, medium, or least: the least does the six-realm location drawing ritual for one day; the medium for seven days; the best does seven sets of seven days. First set up the mandala and vase. Generate yourself and the vase's deity, invite the yeshe beings and absorb them, then do the recitation. Make offerings and praise. Wash the deceased's name-card. Explain karma, cause-effect, and extensive Mahayana Dharma. Teach them to train in the path!

[13025-13037]
The teaching of Dharma—you quote from the Vairochana Perfection: "In this world, omniscient ones appear rarely, like the udumvara flower—perhaps once in a hundred kalpas, or not at all." And so on. Or say: "You have seen the door of Dharma—complete whatever remains of the teaching!"

[13038-13053]
Training in the path—recite a summary of the bardo teachings, or for the common path: "The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the supreme unsurpassable path, the uninterrupted path of enlightenment—relying on these five paths, may you traverse the noble path!" And say: "Like the lotus unstained by mud, unstained by the defilements of the three realms, born from the lotus of existence, may you be born in the blissful realm!"

Emaho! Twenty-one days to guide a soul home!
