[Line range] Listen to this! The teachings here are not for scholars debating in comfort—they're for practitioners facing death.

When confusion arises, don't push it away. When clarity comes, don't grasp it. Both are your own mind's display, like waves on the ocean—appearing and disappearing, never separate from the water itself.

You think you need to purify your mind? That's like trying to wash water! The nature of mind has never been stained, never been pure. It simply IS.

Stop looking for buddhahood somewhere else. It's not in the next retreat, not after more years of practice. It's here—naked, obvious, completely free.

Don't believe me. Look for yourself!

Emaho! Mind and liberation are inseparable!
