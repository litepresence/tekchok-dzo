Thus completes the commentary on pages 207-250 of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Volume Two.

[12831-12855] These pages contain the profound teachings on thod rgal—the direct transcendence practice of the great perfection. From the initial introduction to the final signs of realization, the path has been laid out for those fortunate ones with the karma to practice.

[12856-12880] The key points to remember: the displays of light are your own awareness, not external objects. The four visions mark your progress. The signs of realization confirm your path. Obstacles are recognized and dissolved in the nature of mind.

[12881-12905] Practice with devotion to the lama, with confidence in the teachings, and with recognition of your own nature. These three are the supports for the path.

[12906-12930] Do not be lazy, do not be distracted, do not be discouraged. The path is direct and swift for those who practice sincerely. The result is certain for those who persist.

[12931-12955] May these teachings bring benefit to all who encounter them. May the lineage of the great perfection continue unbroken. May all beings achieve the state of Samantabhadra.

[12956-12980] This commentary was written in the voice of Patrul Rinpoche, following his style of direct, earthy instruction. May it serve as a guide for practitioners on the path of thod rgal.

[12981-13000] Emaho! The marvelous! The wondrous! The natural great perfection!

Emaho!
