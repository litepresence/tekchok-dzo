My devoted ones, these two—deity and lama—are drawn together as one memory because the supreme deity is the lama [13928-13929]. As the Wheel of Delight says: "Glorious Vajra-holder, supreme deity, please pay attention!" [13930-13932].

Introducing through the five paths' power, remembering that very nature, you gain mastery over bardo's dharmakaya, wisdom, light, color, and so forth [13934-13935]. Remembering the birthplace, the final emanation realm's breath is taken, and at this time, being born there, you are liberated [13936].

Remembering meditation, for five days you naturally dwell in natural meditation. Remembering the lama's essential instruction, knowing your own display, you practice dharmata [13937-13938]. Remembering the view, seeing the direct dharmata view previously, now recognizing it without doubt—like meeting a person you knew before [13939-13940].

This transforms the previously deluded appearance into direct appearance, restfully arranged. Delusion becomes clear light, and when rigpa free of grasping and fixation shines within, you see dharmata with the eye free of conceptual investigation [13941-13942]. Through view and meditation free of effort, you arrive at the ground of original purity, reaching the end where all appearance and fixation are exhausted.

Emaho!
