Listen here, you who think Dzogchen needs special locations! Longchenpa tells about "wish-transfer" - and you might misunderstand completely!

First, understand what "Districts and forests etc., existing made non-existing, non-existing made existing!" This isn't about creating something from nothing! It's about recognizing that existence and non-existence are projections of mind. When you see this clearly, you don't need to search for pure lands - every place is already sacred!

"Other places existing here attracted—transfer!" Don't you see the trap? You think "If I could just go to that sacred mountain, I would be more realized!" But Longchenpa is about to destroy this geographical thinking: "Here existing other places projected—transfer!"

[2971–2983]
Now the profound example: "Mounts and girls etc., wind sky drawn, own place transferred!" Longchenpa recalls how Padmasambhava didn't need to travel to find sacred places - he drew them through realization! "Like great master Padma transferred Mangyul's mountains, Samye's Neutang and forests transferred, remaining until today!"

Do you understand? The master is saying: When you recognize mind's nature, you don't need external sacred places! Your own mind becomes the sacred mountain, the pure forest, the hidden valley. "Wind sky drawn" - through realization, you can transfer anywhere!

"This is yogin's wish-accomplishing supreme!" Not through traveling to holy sites, but through recognizing that everywhere is already holy!

[2984-2995]
Now from Spontaneous Liberation: "Wish-transfer yogin fortunate, awareness-possessing mind gathered, form-appearance life-possessing, inner concordant action changes, own sickness etc. other transferred! Thus transferred, entities liberated!" Listen carefully! This isn't about magical powers to affect others! It's about how your recognition naturally affects your environment and relationships.

"Others reliance-connection method do, four elements solid things from, entities becoming reliance-connection, numbers and signs and words, visualization transformed, sickness etc. transferred!" These are the natural capacities that arise when someone recognizes their own nature - they don't need special techniques!

Emaho! Your own place is already sacred - you just need to recognize it!
