Turns to nameless samsara. Life that light-liberates is special. From Tal 'Gyur: "This from showing own object, conditions not entering—wide-open spontaneous, from object-knowing appearance aspect, each directly liberated from own ground."

What difference since khregs chod also explained body-liberated from aggregates without appearance measure? Great difference! Khregs chod liberates but from partless particles, cannot go to light. Without going to light, vajra body not established—occasional illusion body not cut by ultimate. Without obtaining light body, great transference body not obtained, others' benefit great support not established.

From light and particle dissolving aspect, great transference meaning not done, eyes, superknowledges, miracles—great small difference exists.

Second: Rigpa primordially said luminous, khregs chod measures emptiness, not seeing own light. Thod rgal pressing key, dharmata nature's luminosity inwardly held, objects' self-dawn luminosity outwardly appearing shown in method—surpasses.

From Self-Arising: "This self-appearance rigpa king—all have, unrecognized."

Third: Rigpa's wisdom khregs chod not-viewable, covered, not seen, decisively cut as one. Thod rgal opens wisdom's expanse, dharmata's sun rays clear.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Dharmata directly appearing, destroys intellectual apprehending view."

Fourth: Khregs chod depending on coarse channel-winds, thod rgal holding light channel essence, placing lamp on actual path.

From that: "Also channels and delusion wheels, nature-appearing five wisdoms..."

Emaho! Seven specialties of thod rgal!
