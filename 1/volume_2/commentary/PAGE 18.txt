[934-937] In these five aspects appearing, some are sambhogakaya's essence, some field, some method, some appearance, some wisdom itself. Thus Longchenpa explains sambhogakaya as one unified essence appearing fivefold. Not five separate things—one display with five faces!

[938-943] Etymology of sambhogakaya—"longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku" means complete with qualities, engaging pure light-clarity, both benefits spontaneously complete, wisdom arrived at full measure, with marks, signs, body of radiating light rays.

[944-977] From Self-Arising, the complete explanation:
- Abiding in empty dharmata—complete
- Clear, unmixed, pervading all—complete  
- In five wisdoms, gathering and separating not—complete
- Unequal to all, individual marks—complete
- Method and wisdom inseparable—complete
- Five appearances without marks—engage
- Without grasping, self-clear, playing in all—engage
- Crystal-clear, lucid, equally abiding—engage
- Vivid, soft, abiding in field, distributing emanations—engage
- Intent on two kayas, play to the extent—engage

All actions transcended—complete! Arisen from state, not made—complete! Emptiness-wisdom endowed. Clear without thought, grasping nonexistent. This is sambhogakaya's richness—not separate from your own clear awareness right now!
