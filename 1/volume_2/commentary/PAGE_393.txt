Listen to this verse! "Lord of essence-nature-compassion, three kayas of pristine awareness luminous clarity. In sky, sun rising, dispelling darkness. Five pristine awarenesses' characteristics clear. Buddha emanations manifoldly arising." Thus it is said.

Emaho! What a description! Your own nature—essence, nature, and compassion—is the three kayas. Not somewhere else, not later, not after practice! Right now, as the clarity of awareness, dispelling the darkness of confusion like the sun in the sky. The five wisdoms aren't accomplishments—they're the natural radiance of rigpa!

Divided into two bodies: Ground primordially pure and spontaneously accomplished non-dual awareness. Path expanse and pristine awareness taken into experience. Result Dharmakaya appearing as two types, dual purpose perfected. From Thal 'gyur: "From Dharmakaya, form bodies appear clear." Thus.

Divided into three kayas: From essence aspect, empty-aware-knowing pristine awareness Dharmakaya. Self-appearance luminous clarity Sambhogakaya. Various Nirmanakaya. From Mu Tig Phreng Ba: "Three kayas, sole Buddha, five pristine awareness characteristics endowed. Abiding mode established by knowables' manner." Thus.

Don't think these divisions are real separations! They're pedagogical tools. Like describing water as H2O, as wet, as clear, as thirst-quenching—different descriptions, same water!

Divided into four bodies: Three kayas' suchness, free from one-and-many extremes, Svabhavikakaya. Powers, fearlessnesses, eighteen unmixed dharmas, etc., awareness qualities realized, samadhi, superknowledges, great compassion—these are Dharmakaya. Perfected marks and signs, abiding in Akanistha Ghanavyuha realm, Sambhogakaya. Appearing as whatever tames trainees' essence, Nirmanakaya. From Thal 'gyur: "Nirmanakaya and Sambhogakaya and Dharmakaya Svabhavikakaya." Thus.

These also appear in common treatises, matching completely. From Abhisamayalankara: "Svabhavika with Sambhogakaya, likewise others Nirmanakaya, Dharmakaya with activities." Their extensive explanation: "The Sage's Svabhavikakaya, whatever unstained dharmas obtained, completely pure in all ways, those possessing characteristic nature." Thus.

Longchenpa is showing how Dzogchen integrates with common Mahayana. The four kayas of common vehicles are not rejected—they're included as aspects of the Dzogchen view. This is the "higher" vehicle not because it contradicts lower ones, but because it encompasses them while going beyond!
