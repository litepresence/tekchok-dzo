Now understand delusion and liberation! [9617-9633] Wisdom body entered body's hollow, holding fourfold rigpa heart abiding, and pervading all sentient beings—shown. This is natural delusion-mode introduction. Delusion condition-arisen like crystal light, various things appearing like crystal light, appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal, inexhaustible increase-decrease absent like crystal light—understand these and properly join sign-meaning.

[9634-9665] Sentient beings' liberation mode sign-meaning: From Blazing Lamp—"Base itself ripens result, knowing wisdom. Wisdom ripens as body, essence dharma body that, ripens as wisdom dharma body." From heart five wisdoms three-tiered, liver wind and wisdom's resonance two meeting, potency-mind arising, potency-base dissolving unmoving abiding example. Inner light outer-radiating white mind example. Sixth called mind. Five lights wisdom example. Base-holding rigpa. Mind and wisdom two example introduction thus established. Intermediate state introduction sound-light-ray three, Vajrasattva's inner channel-vein root introduction and so forth—on crystal establish certain knowledge, join yogin's face and knowledge, make certain and practice.

[9666-9696] Liberation result mode: though inner-clear kadag liberation base self-arisen essence body clear, outer-clear five lights and white two mixed introduction, this having wisdom is crucial. Path wisdom or those wishing no wisdom, Madhyamaka extreme non-abiding, or us Dzogchen kadag no wisdom wishers—even if delusion purified from root, two bodies unceased arising, wisdom must exist in expanse. Five lights white mixed is mirror wisdom; white separately arising is sambhogakaya emanating nirmanakaya example. These are two purities possessing all aspects knowing buddhahood introduction.

[9697-9713] Buddhas' parinirvana means sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya dissolving into dharmakaya—crystal sun's condition separated, original base kadag held unmoving unconfused abiding, essence inseparable thus ka-liberation, yet through recognizing-not recognizing difference, all as wisdom body alone abiding is called all-knowing. Especially wisdom two-possessing. Inner-clear existing carries to exhaustion ground, primordial person's universal base self-arisen essence body inseparable.

Emaho!
