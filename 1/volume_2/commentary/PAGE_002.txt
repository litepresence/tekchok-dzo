Now we're getting into the meat of it. Longchenpa is going to explain outer-arising in detail, and look at the structure—tenfold! He's laying out: essence, definitive terminology, purpose, characteristics, sequence of functions, dharma-nature, applied meaning, manner of liberation, division, and completeness. This isn't just a list; it's a complete mandala of understanding. Don't rush through these ten like they're boxes to check off. Each one is a doorway into direct recognition.

[70-79]
First, the essence: Outer-arising appearing as form—what you see as earth, water, fire, wind, space—is the play of inner-arising's actuality. Do you hear this? That mountain you see outside? It's the play, the display, the sport of what's happening inside you. Gathered within the inner domain, these are the five elements. The outer five become the container, the world that holds sentient beings. The inner five become the support for mind and awareness itself. 

This is crucial: your mind doesn't just happen to exist in a body made of elements. The very elements *are* the support for mind and *rig pa*—awareness. They're not separate from awareness; they're its foundation.

[80-87]
From the Thalgyur tantra: The assertion is that from the particularities of general-common karma—yes, we share this world because of collective karma—and by individual karma-supports, relying upon the outer elements, karma itself, sustenance, faculties, entourage, and birth are complete. 

Look at your life: your body, your senses, your relationships, your very birth—all of this depends on these five elements. This isn't theory; this is describing your actual situation right now.

[88-99]
Second, definitive terminology. From the Self-Arisen again. Listen to these seven definitions of why they're called "great arising" (*'byung ba chen po*):

Not arisen through fabrication, spontaneously complete—they're not made by anyone, they just are. By that which produces, they are arising—they give rise to everything. By pervading all migrators—beings in all six realms—they're great. By simultaneous birth—everything arises at once, not sequentially—they're great. By existing in themselves—they don't depend on anything else. By being without change—their nature doesn't change even as their forms manifest. By appearing harmoniously—they work together perfectly.

This is the definitive terminology. Don't just memorize these seven; let them point you to the nature of the elements as they actually are.

[100-127]
Third, the purpose—this is where it gets practical. From the Thalgyur:

Water gathers the clear essence and separates impurities—this is its function. In your body, water regulates heat and cold. Earth holds the foundation, establishes and coheres, ripens to produce roots (the channels), and its purpose is the relative thigle. Fire increases arising, ripens and clarifies, blazes and spreads to produce the eyes and senses—its purpose is warmth. Wind scatters and lifts, moves and quivers, holds the body together by moving—its purpose is the abode of mind.

The four elements (he's leaving out space for a moment) are the great mandala of self. They become the cause for accomplishing body, abide in the middle holding everything together, and in the end perform all functions of destruction. Through one cause—these elements appear as the master who performs all the various activities.

What is Longchenpa telling you? Your body isn't just flesh and bone—it's a mandala of elements, each with specific functions that support your very consciousness. When you meditate, when you practice, you're working with these elements. Understanding their purpose isn't academic—it's the basis of the completion stage practices!

[128-129]
Fourth, characteristics—from among five. Earth's characteristic: solidity. This continues onto the next page, but already you can see: he's going to give you the specific characteristic of each element. Earth is solid. But don't think this means earth is just "hard stuff." Solidity here means stability, foundation, the quality of holding. This is the nature of earth as element—not just dirt, but the principle of stability itself.

Recognize these elements in your own experience. When you feel stable, grounded—that's earth. When you feel fluid, adaptable—that's water. When you feel clear, perceptive—that's fire. When you feel movement, change—that's wind. When you feel spacious, open—that's space. These aren't metaphors. This is how the elements actually appear in your mind and body.
