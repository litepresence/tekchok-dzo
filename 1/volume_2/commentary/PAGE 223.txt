Now see the nature of display! [9807-9828] From Klong Drugpa: "All displays like magical illusion, like dream and like reflection." From Root Wisdom: "Like dream, like illusion, like mirage city, thus birth and thus abiding, thus also not destroyed." To whom appearing appears to mind, like cataract hair-falls appearing to eye-faulty faculty. From that: "To existing observed mind, various displays self-arise, names and colors individually form bodies, two aspects complete."

[9829-9856] Though appearing to mind, appearing modes outer-clear these not own mind—self non-existent yet existing, abiding as object, color, form and so forth seen. Mind lacks these thus not mind. Here outer display forms etc. appearing externally these non-existent clear-appearing delusion dream-like introduction, this form, this color grasping thus arising, first arising appearance object holder is called appearance mind, grasping mind, object mind—know thus. That appearing mind existing or not, object non-existent clear-appearing holding also untrue, color determination unrealized thus non-existent, birth-abode-ceasing three examined also non-existent, therefore mind itself empty introduction, self-liberated without release yes sang introduction.

[9857-9875] Thus common dharma and Dzogchen many appearance and appearance object undifferentiated, outer appearance object own-characteristic mind-wish is mind-only real-entity with scent falling into error. Here appearance as mind introduction time, appearance non-appearance mind holding, object first meeting mind appearance mind, later that special mind arising investigating, holding mind called, abandoning object purifying object deluded appearance deluded holder samsara called. Truly two: mind and mental factors three realms, superimposed aspects concept.

Emaho!
