Listen, dear practitioner! Look here at this precious crystal teaching [9538-9584]! Just as a crystal is pure by nature, clear inside and out without obstruction, so is the dharmakaya - the true nature of your own mind!

The crystal's inner light represents prajna, the life-force wisdom, while the outer clear light shows how emanation bodies arise. Do you see? The crystal itself demonstrates the ground wisdom, the primordial nature that abides unchanged!

Like a crystal reflecting all colors yet remaining pure and empty, your own awareness recognizes all appearances while itself remaining unstained. The lamp arrangements from the tantra show this directly - through example, through signs, through meaning itself!

Samantabhadra's appearance is like a mirror, dear one! When you look into a clear mirror, what do you see? Your own face! So too when you look into the nature of mind - you see the face of your own primordial wisdom, clear and unobstructed!

Do not seek elsewhere! The crystal-like rigpa is already present, spontaneously abiding, non-ceasing, without direction. This is the direct introduction to your own nature. Recognize it now!

Through example you understand the meaning. Through signs you gain confidence. Through deciding the essence, the three primordial wisdoms established in the base ripen as fruit. Without seeking, you see the result yourself!

Emaho!
