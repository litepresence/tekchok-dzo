Middle instruction now: four precious mental trainings. How they relate to secret mantra: Outer is basis for purification—mind, speech, body made basis for dharmata seeing. Middle is root of qualities—benefiting beings through conduct, compassion, generosity. Inner is main path—mind wisdom that realizes dharmata.

All precious trainings are part of secret mantra's path—scripture ground is wisdom ground. Three types: gradual, sudden, liberation—this is sudden pith, transcends cause-effect through direct seeing. Two ways to practice precious trainings: restraining non-virtues and practicing virtues.

First has five: seeing all as emptiness, practicing generosity through self-liberation through emptiness, patience, diligence, concentration, wisdom. Unchanged main practice views samsara as exhaustion—seeing all phenomena's emptiness.

Changed view sees samsara as benefit for others—all appearances as self-liberation through emptiness—bodhicitta's conduct to achieve buddhahood for others.

Emaho! Three trainings, three ways, one realization!
