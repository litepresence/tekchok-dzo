Now hear the fivefold completion! [9385-9395] From Sengé Tsal Dzogchen: "Mountain Summit Gathering doctrine is like lion's playful posture. Wisdom Pouring doctrine is like royal empowerment at the crown. Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine is like peacock chick hatching from egg. Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine is like sun and moon non-dually entering. Ocean Depths Opening doctrine is like sun rising from Meru's neck."

[9396-9412] Thus each of these five supplications differentiated by three faculties makes fifteen, each with view-meditation-conduct-result fourfold makes sixty dharmas—purifying kalpa's evolution-devolution, sentient beings' afflictions, and views' sixty variations, showing pure nature through practicing wisdom. The Sugata Vajradhara spoke thus. From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle: "Lhungrub Thodgal wisdom practice key point certainty, the twenty-first chapter." Thus having taught practice methods through guidance, now extensively explaining how to practice through introduction, in two parts: general introduction's sequence establishing all dharmas, and particular differentiation extensively explaining mind and wisdom's symbols.

[9413-9428] First has preliminaries and main introduction: preliminaries are preparing a retreat house half-open with sunlight's rays, crystal mirror stainless—a preliminary. From the Introduction Ornament Tantra: "The retreat place half-open, hole with sun's rays, mirror clear showing, light display seen outward." There, through Vajrasattva heart mirror's symbol introduction showing previous occurrence, in this Jambudvipa, from the Turning Samsara's Wheel Jewel Secret Tantra: "Holder of five buddhas' lineage, crystal stupa five-tiered, five wisdoms' nature, five sky-lineage holder, spreading in unseen sky, unmixed colors individually clear."

[9429-9455] Essence, nature, compassion three—essence unceasing pure base, nature five great elements, compassion showing form bodies. From Vajra Space mandala, natural spontaneously accomplished body, five wisdoms possessing moon-water body, unclear-clear self-nature, crystal stupa five-tiered, descended to Vajradhara's left. Three aspects of sound-form, entering the corner of southeast, night direction day-like. Wisdom placed at right corner, alone certain buddha seen. Wisdom special insight is buddhas' sole intention. Nectar tongue meets meaning, rigpa's cuckoo one voice. Unchanging vajra body supreme, advice tikka corner-going, Vajrasattva's testament.

Emaho!
