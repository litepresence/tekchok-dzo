Listen, fortunate child! From such practice [11136-11143] arise these signs and measures: body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness.

The five senses [11144-11161] dissolve into their natureless state—this is the measure! Now the text distinguishes signs more precisely [11162-11182]: outer body signs, inner awareness signs, and how they combine.

When you are truly confident in ka-dag's realization, no more births in samsara! Signs: body without parasites, hair and nails not growing. Then after three months, others see you in five-colored light, kayas of the five families rising into space and dissolving.

This [11183-11231] is the great fortunate one reaching exhaustion! Different combinations of signs lead to different liberations—in the bardo, as a nirmanakaya, or directly. Know these distinctions well! Like different streams flowing into the same ocean, all paths of recognition lead to buddhahood, yet the manner of arrival varies.

The supreme bodhisattva [11212-11231] holds beings with compassion, remaining for hundreds of thousands of years in a single human body to perfect benefit for others. This is the great play of spontaneous presence!

Emaho!
