Ah, listen well! These are general arrangements [11985-12008], but specific exceptions exist. Bad signs—wind, hail, etc.—may be sent by non-human wrathful ones or appear when evil beings die. Good signs—rainbows, clear sky—may appear when good beings die or attain concentrations.

The key [12009-12034]: these signs arise from the dying person's own mind. If they lived well and good signs appear, this is appropriate; if they lived badly but good signs appear, it is others' signs affecting them—like finding a rainbow when seeking profit, called "meeting rainbow's meaning."

The Blazing Relics Tantra [12035-12075] teaches extensively: black sky, rain, steam, wind, hail, dust all indicate hell-realm birth. Yellow fading light, dead sun and moon indicate preta. Dark hazy sky indicates animals. Fierce wind and terrifying clouds indicate asuras. Clear sky with bright luminaries indicates gods. Clear sky with gentle clouds indicates humans.

These signs [12076-12091] arrive two or three days before birth in that realm. Without signs, where one takes rebirth is known through their own karma—death-time visions of hell-fire, hunger-thirst fears, confused awareness, or visions of previous human realms, mountains, oceans, god-palaces, gardens, or dawn-like appearances.

Emaho!
