Listen! Appearance's deluded nature—wisdom it is, previously unseen. Conceptual delusion's ground non-existent, alaya dharmakaya great realized!

Delusion's self-concept continuum ceased! Thus non-deluded appearance—primordially from razor's pith it arises. Beings' aggregates buddha body—primordially so, who doesn't know?

Aggregates as buddha lord—channel residence letters accomplished. Bubble eye's wisdom—self-appearance it is, who hasn't seen?

From Pearl Garland: Natural appearing dharmas, stainless, coarse-fine reversed. Without grasping, delusion reversed. Without movement, karma-wind reversed. Transparent, phenomena reversed!

See? What you thought was impure was pure all along! Like mistaking a rope for a snake in dim light—turn on the lamp, just a rope!

Emaho! Delusion and wisdom—not two!
