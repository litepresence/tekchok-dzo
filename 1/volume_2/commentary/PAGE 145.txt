[6139-6143] Listen, dear practitioner! The nature of visionary delusion—this is wisdom! Previously you did not see it as wisdom. Because the basis of conceptual delusion does not exist, the alaya is realized as the great dharmakaya. The continuity of delusion's self-concept has ceased!

[6144-6149] Thus, delusion-free vision arises from the key point of primordial fallenness. The aggregates of beings are the Buddha body—who does not know they are primordially so? The aggregates as Buddha, the lord of possession, channels and letters completely arise from the basis!

[6150-6153] Like bubbles in the eyes—who has not seen that wisdom is self-appearance?

Do you see, practitioner? Your delusion is wisdom! Your aggregates are Buddha! What you took as impure is primordially pure. What you took as deluded is primordially awake. Do not try to purify what is already pure. Do not try to wake up what is already awake. Simply recognize what you are—this is the Great Perfection!

Emaho! Your aggregates are the Buddha body—recognize this!
