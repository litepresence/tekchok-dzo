[5606-5609] Listen, dear practitioner! Three unmoving body establishes the base. Three bindings take measure. Three obtainings give pointing. Four confidences show liberation measure!

[5610-5619] From Spontaneous Liberation: "There make extreme reliance and faith. Three unmoving base established, wind-mind arrived at key point! Three abidings measure taken, dream reverse and body, speech, mind—signs and measure certainly taken!"

[5620-5633] From Jewel Garland: "Three unmoving confidence place, self-nature path exhausted! Confidence remaining not, doubt self-liberated. Confidence again not, hope and fear released. Confidence path not, effort spontaneously accomplished!"

[5634-5649] Also from same: Three unmoving, three abidings, three obtainings—these are not techniques! They are recognition of what already is. Do not try to unmoving your body—recognize it is already unmoving!

Do you see? The base is already established! The measure is already taken! Stop trying to achieve what is already complete!

Emaho! Three unmoving, three abidings, three obtainings—all complete!

—Patrul Rinpoche, fireside
