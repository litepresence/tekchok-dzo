Fortunate disciple, now death-point bardo instructions [12701-12720]—clearing unclear like a beautiful woman mirror-looking—eight aspects: certain death causes with examples, death signs investigation, reversal methods, death-point appearances, crucial pointing-out instructions, birth-place signs, purification rituals, uncommon other places.

First [12721-12750]: difficult to obtain Jambudvipa as Dharma-practicing place, obtained; difficult to obtain leisure and endowments, obtained; difficult to meet guru good spiritual friend, met; difficult to enter sublime Dharma precious door, entered; difficult to know unsurpassed instructions unfabricated, known; difficult to abandon samsara suffering's ocean, abandoned to go to liberation enlightenment's island—if not practiced now with effort and courage, outer such favorable conditions will not occur again.

Nagarjuna's statement [12751-12770]: "Dwelling in favorable place, relying on holy beings, oneself well-prayed, previous virtues arise—you possess the four great wheels." Shantideva: "This leisure is extremely difficult to obtain; for one who has accomplished purpose, if not diligent now, when will favorable conditions arise again?"

From the Treasury [12771-12800]: having obtained such leisure, if not diligent now, the dead go to lower realms; for kalpas numbering billions, even happy realms' sound is not heard—what need to speak of obtaining happiness?

Emaho!
