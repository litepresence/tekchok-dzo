**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [14225-14266]

My heart-children, pay attention! The fifth, how samadhi is born: At that time, in pure dharmata nature, intellect's engagement ceases and you abide non-conceptually [14225-14226].

How it ceases: What ceases ceases in your own continuum [14228]. How does it cease? Grasping previous qualities' appearance as dharmata pure mode ceases [14229-14230].

What appearance at that time? Dharmata ceased appearance arises, so bad conceptual thoughts of previous attachment, future grasping, good clairvoyance, memory, and so forth definitely do not arise—like pure sky [14231-14233].

From Union of Sun and Moon: "Continuous samadhi continuum self-arising as nature, bad conceptual thoughts definitely do not arise" [14235-14236].

At this stage, know the twenty-one faculties' liberation and delusion ways [14237].

The sixth, how spontaneous accomplishment dissolves: Previously arisen now gathering within [14240-14241].

Eight modes of dissolving arise simultaneously [14242]:
- Compassion dissolving into compassion: like sun's rays gathering at sunset
- Six realms' appearance not seen in own face, impure delusion nameless, beyond visible appearance
- Light dissolving into light: like rainbow melting in sky, light and color signs' distinction gone, empty beyond grasping, single taste in dharmadhatu
- Form dissolving into form: like vase form, objects clear within, no signs' features as face and hands, pure
- Wisdom dissolving into wisdom: like child entering mother's lap, dharmata mother and child nondual, no grasping
- Non-duality dissolving into non-duality: like river into river, originally liberated, single taste as dharmakaya, equal, without distinction, free of elaboration [14242-14252]

Emaho!
