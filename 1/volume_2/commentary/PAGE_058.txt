Listen! Now Longchenpa gives you the method—how to actually work with the winds and elements so that you recognize when death comes. This isn't theory; this is what you DO.

"Because the precipice of the six realms is equal." Understand this—all six migrations, all possible destinies, they're right there in your own body. The difference between enlightenment and hell is how you work with what's given.

"Pierce all points of body, speech, and mind." This means go deep—find the crucial points (*gnad*) where body, speech, and mind connect. "Mix mind-itself with dharmata." Let your naked awareness mix with the nature of reality itself—not as two things meeting, but as water mixing with water.

"Draw wind and awareness upward." This is the practice—when death comes, the winds drop. But if you've trained, you draw them up, you direct awareness. "Because deluded appearance is exhausted, always familiarize with wind."

Emaho! This is the key instruction!

Now the methods for victory over obstacles—nectar and equal-taste of elements. Two crucial points here:

First, nectar (*bdud rtsi*). This isn't ordinary food. "Smeared reverse with food and beer, eaten, separate from bad smell." The alchemical reversal—what was impure becomes pure through transformation. Do oil—use essence boiled in pot. This is *chulen* practice, essence extraction.

From this: body's arising continuum is cut. Wonder! Great essence extraction explained. "Always reversing feces"—yes, you read that right. Finally the body's outflows cease. By essence-extracted oil, with marks shown, elements' continuums cease.

Feel what this means: when the body's elements' continuum is cut, sentient beings don't dwell in body. Without excrement, urine, etc. Without outer-inner wind. This time is the great yogi!

Food and clothes both become pure. Upon this lifespan and enjoyment—certainly accomplish as wished. This isn't deprivation; this is freedom from needing anything.

[2820-2836]
Equal-taste of elements (*'byung ba ro snyoms*)—holding the four winds of earth, water, fire, and wind. Through extensive practice of channel-wind-essence in the four wheels' mandala, body essence-extraction pure, before as. From this accomplish lifespan, enjoyment, food, clothes.

The practice: hide wind mixed with body. By each self-body's elements, transform, use that itself. Meditate point-gathered mandala. By that familiarized, measure complete. From four powers equal, use blissfully, free from fear.

This also accomplishes food and clothes two, lifespan and enjoyment complete. At this time, inner vessel letter recite drive—or whatever method suits your capacity.

The point? These practices aren't ends in themselves. They're preparations so that when the bardo comes, you're ready. You've already tasted what it's like when the elements dissolve into equal taste. You recognize it. That's liberation!
