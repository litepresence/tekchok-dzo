Listen! There is "Jewel Various Arrangement." In that too, emanation body Meaningful Accomplishment's field realm, measureless palace has such qualities. House made of jewel indranila, four corners. Four directions, four great windows. From there sun rises, green light fills inside. All ground also made of indranila. Outside, water with eight qualities. That water, touching brings bliss, drinking eliminates all diseases. Outside that, seven ponds, inside various sweet-voiced birds dwell. Thus: Bird King Golden Swan, Thingril, Katari Bird, Peacock, Netso who knows human speech, Cuckoo, Shangshangte'u, Reskegs, etc., eighty thousand sweet-voiced bird types. Pleasant bird types like this: Kangkari, Zer Mo, Sba Ba, Divine Bird with Bell Sound, Bird Kritipa with Golden Vajra Form, etc. Turquoise color-like blue, Conch color-like white, Coral color-like red, Indranila color-like green, etc. Pleasant, sweet-voiced, beyond thought.

Outside that, seven jewel iron mountains. In their center, throne made of margata jewel, with Dharma teaching seat. There emanation body Meaningful Accomplishment, dawn teaches pith instruction Dharma. Noon teaches empowerment Dharma. Morning teaches action Dharma. Sun noon teaches view-meditation Dharma. Thus daily, four Dharma sessions, liberating retinues' mindstreams.

Emaho! The "birds" are metaphor for the natural sounds of wisdom. The "eight qualities of water" are the eight liberations. The "seven jewels" are the seven treasures of the noble ones. This isn't describing a vacation spot—it's the natural richness of the awakened mind, where every perception is Dharma!
