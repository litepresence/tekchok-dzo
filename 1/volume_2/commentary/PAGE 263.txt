Ah, listen carefully! The five relics' characteristics [11527-11556] are beautifully described: shariram white and radiant, chariram dark blue, churiram yellow, beriram red, nyariram green—all round and smooth like sesame seeds, containing fivefold light at their core.

From the Blazing Relics [11557-11570]: peaceful relics liberate into self-appearing certainty of their respective families; wrathful relics achieve dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, effective enlightenment kaya, and unchanging vajra kaya. Five relics, five kayas—inseparable!

The text quotes [11571-11586]: "Shariram achieves unborn, churiram achieves effective, chariram achieves sambhogakaya, nyariram achieves nirmanakaya, pancharam achieves vajra nature." This is not mere poetry—it is the direct correlation between practice and result!

Ringsel [11587-11613] differs from relics—they are similar but ringsel can be destroyed by elements, while relics cannot. Ringsel are like the husk; relics are like the seed. Both indicate liberation, but relics are indestructible, like a diamond that survives the fire that burns the mountain.

The locations [11614-11644] where they arise: shariram from the crown, chariram from between the ribs, churiram from above the liver, beriram from the kidneys, nyariram from above the lungs. Each location corresponds to an element's purification.

Emaho!
