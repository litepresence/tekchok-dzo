[7718-7749]
Liberated yet self-liberated. Like sky and clouds. Thus not like view-meditation conduct depending on other objects, with faults—"liberated by meaning" means dharma-exhausted.

Self-liberation has three: understanding self-liberation; establishing validity; liberation mode.

Understanding: no antidote meaning. Appearance itself self-liberated from appearance—no dharmata other than appearance. Similarly emptiness, etc.—nothing other than that itself liberating.

Like alcoholic cured by alcohol; poison destroyed by poison; iron cut by iron.

Afflictions liberated by that itself—called self-liberation.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: dharmata's reasoning validates—all liberations are self-liberations, not other-untied. If other-liberated, like impossible one substance appearing as different forms. Like thing's characteristic established by thing.

Scripture: from Mind Section—"Liberation self-arisen, not from other."

Reasons: established by great self-liberation no-dispute reason.

Appearance self-liberated, no dependence on other antidote.

[7756-7777]
Liberation mode: nothing other than self-liberated by itself. Whatever appears, appearance liberates itself. Whatever arises, liberation by that. Appearances manifold yet self-liberated equal, like waves and water. Clouds manifold yet sky equal. Even water and ice equal as water.

All liberations equal in equality—no hope for liberation, no fear of delusion, no trace.

Emaho! Self-liberation without other antidotes!
