**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [13690-13724]

My dear students, pay close attention to what is being taught here! From your own heart center, light rays shoot forth and connect with the hearts of all these deities [13690-13692]. This is not mere imagination—it is the actual connection of your own radiance, like light passing through crystal. When you see this with your own eyes, the conceptual mind ceases and you rest in natural meditation [13693].

The essential instruction for non-returning is given here: the five light rays coil together like a horse's tail [13694]. At first, awareness enters into the light—when you look at these appearances, recognize them as your own display and rest in that recognition [13695-13696]. Like a mother embracing her child, the outer lights dissolve into your heart center [13703-13704]. This is how you attain liberation in the ground of original purity.

The text quotes the Union of Sun and Moon [13707]: "The person's clear light dissolves into union." All appearances self-arise as the display of the kayas, neither large nor small, equal in all aspects, adorned with ornaments, colors, postures, thrones, and mudras [13710-13716]. Each group of five is pervaded by pairs of five, with light mandalas—the father's aspect holding the lineages, the mother's aspect, the male and female bodhisattvas—all complete in one.

Emaho!
