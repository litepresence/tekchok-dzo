Immeasurable, so vast. Buddhas, so powerful. View's ultimate deliverance place. Unchanging nail. Beyond this-side seeing intellect's examined object, bow. All-knowing mirror. All paths' traversed peak. Liberation object. Secret king's all dharmas' great treasury house.

From No Letter: "Awareness pristine awareness unmistakenly shown. Unchanging root great scripture. Vast dharma great appearance. Intent suchness great power. View self-arisen great deliverance place. Unchanging great nail letter. Always difficult great bow. Difficult to see great mirror. Difficult to traverse great path. Difficult to abide great object. Difficult to reach great ground. Appearance without existing, great appearance. Bottomless, difficult to measure great. Non-pervading self-radiance great. Great knowing without analyzer. Object-knowing non-dual great intent. Mindless great appearance."

Emaho! These "greats" are not exaggerations—they're pointing to the utter transcendence of your nature. Beyond all measure, beyond all limits, yet right here! Don't make it distant—it's the immediacy of your own awareness!
