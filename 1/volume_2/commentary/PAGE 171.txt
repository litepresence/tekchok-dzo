"No difference even a speck in completing the collections—thus have I taught! Kye Speech Vajra! By the key of rigpa's wisdom without coming or going—between the person with various dharmata signs arisen in body and speech, and the person who hasn't trained mind even an instant in study and reflection—no difference even a speck in seeing reality—thus I taught!"

"By the key of no birth or cessation in dharmata—between one experiencing hell's heat and cold, and one experiencing Buddhas' bliss—no difference even a speck in obtaining realization—thus I taught!"

"By the key of rigpa's unchanging nature—between cutting through dharmic elaborations and eternalist view—no difference even a speck—thus I taught!"

"By the key of dharmakaya existing in oneself—between extensive outer offerings and praise, and sitting without activity—no difference even a speck in obtaining result—thus I taught!"

"Therefore, those who practice these great self-arisen words, finding confidence in unmaintained experience, are Buddhas inseparable from appearance and three kayas."

These eight word-kings are established by eight great unchanging meaning-reasons. For supreme minds, explain literally. For lesser minds, explain through two truths so they'll understand later.

Emaho! The natural state is beyond all partiality!
