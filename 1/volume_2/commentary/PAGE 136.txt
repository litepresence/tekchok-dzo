Conduct and accumulation! Ten perfections become conduct, accumulations become conduct.

First six: giving, ethics, patience, diligence, concentration, wisdom, skillful means—these become natural conduct when practiced with emptiness wisdom.

Four perfections: aspirations, power, prayer, primordial wisdom—these are supporting practices that become conduct through seeing emptiness.

Accumulation transforms: When you realize emptiness, merit becomes not-grasping—benefiting others without clinging, like clouds drifting in open sky. Wisdom becomes not-elaborating—knowing beyond words, like space knowing all sounds without being trapped.

The illusion of practice: Some accumulate merit hoping for future reward—they're like merchants calculating profits. Real practitioners accumulate merit and wisdom simultaneously—like sun shining and warming at once.

Then conduct completion: accumulations become natural activity, like water naturally flowing downward and upward.

Emaho! Ten perfections, one realization!
