[Line range] Wake up, friend! You're sleeping through the most precious teachings.

The Great Perfection isn't something you learn—it's something you recognize. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life and suddenly seeing them clearly. The recognition takes no time, but you might have spent years not noticing.

Your mind right now, as you read this, is complete and perfect. Not after you understand better. Not after you meditate more. Right now.

All your seeking, all your practices—they're like looking for your head with a lamp. You can't find it because it's never been lost!

Stop searching and see what's already here.

Emaho! Recognition is instant liberation!
