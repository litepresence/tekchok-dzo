Fortunate child, understand! General sutra places [12311-12340] have two truths, two intentions—four modes. Tantra sections have literal and non-literal—six limits to be known.

The Thalgyur states [12341-12361]: "Bardo's appearance: nature-abiding aggregates, elements, afflictions as objects; death-point like bubbles floating, awareness not abiding one-pointedly. Dharmata bardo with kayas and wisdoms, light and color; thigle, elements' appearances—as whatever appears, dharmata's mansion."

Samsara's appearance [12362-12378]: various flashing, flickering like dream appearances—true appearance, false mind's object. Six families' lights: white, blue, yellow, red, green, multicolored—each realm's objects appearing.

Bardo boundaries [12379-12400]: nature-abiding from leaving mother's womb until final death-sickness strikes; death-point from breath not yet ceased until inner breath stops; dharmata from inner breath stopped until clear light dawns and lhundrub appears; samsara from lhundrub ceasing and flickering dream-like appearance until entering mother's womb.

This [12401-12413] is called "instruction for provisions when meeting the traveler"—provisions given to the traveler setting out on the death-journey, crucial instructions for the death-point's pain and various appearances.

Emaho!
