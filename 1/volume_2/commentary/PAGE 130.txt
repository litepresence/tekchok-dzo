Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo. This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra: When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion, fingers and so forth appear thus. Focusing this, elements naturally cease. Through the difference of birth and entry, upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted, without holding anything whatsoever, one abides—this is the emanation body. Through this, the power of entry's force, who has obtained self-power over birth, also focusing upon that, again at times doing thus, the self-sound of vision rustling, manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion. Through this, doing all benefit for beings, for awareness is equal and one, the great transfer of three thousand beings is accomplished by this.

Thus through gradual and instantaneous, the body is accomplished by this. All that is free from body-exhaustion measure. All this, certain result, accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.

Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—like the rungs of a ladder. That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease; from the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished. Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself, especially sublime from the common vehicles, having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.

Upon that itself: For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood, if possessing this means, it is thus. For other conduct is pride itself, not seeing entity. Therefore this is all rare words—always look to this jewel treasure.

Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.

Emaho! Jewel treasure, rare words—this is the heart's own secret!
