Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra!

"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—deluded appearance is my speech."

Look—seeing doesn't cease, appearing like my form. Hearing doesn't cease, sounding like my voice. Smelling doesn't cease, feeling like my scent. Tasting doesn't cease, spreading like my taste. Touching doesn't cease, moving like my mind. Secret afflictions are my miracles! Buddhas and sentient beings are my cemetery!

"All-doing I am—great self-clear appearance!"

[7052-7059]
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become more deluded?

Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!

From the Pearl Garland: "Sentient beings in samsara are bound by their own conceptions. Knowing they're natureless, definitely liberated."

[7060-7084]
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—that's enough!

Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the grasping, Naropa!"

This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature! Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "By thinking, wisdom's meaning isn't found. If wisdom's meaning found by thinking, self-arisen wisdom becomes false..."

Recognizing appearance and awareness as dharmata, whatever you do in conduct doesn't transcend dharmata!

Emaho! All activity becomes the path when resting in natural flow!
