Without knowing self-pure without searching, like muddy water wanting clear—clearing again and again, not cleared. Even clear, not dharmata. Without knowing self-appearance loose, like ordinary foolish appearance—apprehending grasping not reversed."

Know the key of self-liberation by itself like water's wave!

Here also two mind-levels: self-liberation with effort—when affliction arises, recognizing and placing in own place, self-liberated dissolved in nature of pure place, never distracted instant in great equal self-liberation, training dynamic display.

Effortless: whatever arises cannot stand, self-dissolved dharmata, so method of viewing abandons without abandoning, liberated by nature flow or force.

From that same text: "These mind-levels two: with effort and effortless. With effort placed in own place, appearance familiarized measure. Wisdom-pure appearance itself. When outer inner all self-dawn, not born from conditions. However these arise, placed in own place self-liberated. Therefore yogin of appearance. Effortless like this: self-liberated by itself to itself..."

Emaho! Self-liberation without searching or achieving!
