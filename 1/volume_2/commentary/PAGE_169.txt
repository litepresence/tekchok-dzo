"Kye Speech Vajra! Look at self-arisen wisdom's view—wonder! Beyond virtue and vice, beyond view and meditation! Ground unmoved—whatever body and speech do, free from benefit and harm of virtue and vice. Ha ha!"

[7200-7208]
"Look at the mode of abiding of reality's nature—wonder! Appearance doesn't change color, doesn't shift. However happiness or suffering is thought, nothing happens to the meaning. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"

[7204-7212]
"Look at the wisdom of great emptiness, source of all—wonder! Whatever memory-thought conduct is done, appears as display. However done, liberates as unborn in unceasing expanse. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"

[7213-7223]
"Look at wisdom of empty awareness pervading all—wonder! Unborn and abiding together from the start. Even if a man took sharp weapons and liberated all beings at one time, that person's stream is free from benefit and harm. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"

"Look at your own awareness, empty all-appearance wisdom—wonder! However appearing, all dawn as your own companion. Whatever appears, doesn't move from your own ground. Ha ha!"

[7224-7230]
"Look at awareness-empty all-liberated appearance—wonder! Your own antidote is greatest! Afflictions self-liberate by themselves. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at awareness-empty all's nature—wonder! Without effort, result self-found. One finished, all samsara-nirvana purified as nondual. Ha ha!"

Emaho! These laughs shatter all conceptual mind!
