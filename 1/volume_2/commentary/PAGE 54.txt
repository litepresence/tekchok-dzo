Now listen! Gods and humans have their meditation practices too. What's their method? They hold the mouth and nose breath, make mind thought-free and unmoved—this is one-pointed awareness essence. No instantaneous thoughts, they say.

But does this show the great true meaning? No! It cannot indicate it. Stop right there! Don't think "thought-free" is the goal. It's just the beginning, not the end.

Second, the bodhisattvas' meditation—two types: actual divisions and auxiliary arisen. First, briefly taught: from Rangshar—bodhisattvas' meditation is held by mind, arises by manner or force. Familiarized, becomes expanse, abandons food-concept. Ground-dwellers practice it. Thought-free by manner.

But this also cannot indicate the great meaning! Why? Because the nature's meaning is rigpa clear-light—not merely thought-free dwelling. Therefore cannot indicate great meaning.

Extensively explained—three types: Nature-force meditation arises spontaneously, non-thought manner, just placing body-speech relaxed. Focused-support meditation meditates antidote of view—nature without afflictions subtle-coarse, just suppressing afflictions' heads. Ground-dwellers' meditation—ground's actual concentration, only purifying self-ground latencies.

From Sun-Moon Union: Great Vehicle's meditation—by nature-force, unfabricated body-speech relaxed. By focused-support, suppress instantaneous afflictions' heads. By ground-dwellers', sustains self-self continuum.

Do you see? All these are methods, not recognition!

Second: showing arisen-from-arising meditation—two: nature and fabricated. First, nature meditation—sentient beings all, when awareness distracted, arises from slightly trembling abiding, exists upon archer's eye, upon sleeping eye within rabbit and eagle, etc. Briefly: exists always when mind-consciousness is distracted.

Second is fabricated meditation: meditation, concentration, non-thought, thought-with deity generation-completion—all fabricated deliberately by mind, because deliberately done by intellect.

Emaho! Don't mistake these for Dzogchen, friend! Gods, humans, and bodhisattvas—their meditations are steps on the path, not the final recognition!
