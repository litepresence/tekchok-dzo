**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [14087-14114]

My devoted students, you might wonder how clairvoyance of body and mind arises when there is no body or mind. The answer is that the obscurations to body and mind clairvoyance are purified at this time by power, so it is said. Just as the five afflictions becoming ground makes them wisdom [14070-14071].

However, afflictions becoming wisdom by purification power does not mean afflictions themselves transform into wisdom—that is impossible because virtue and non-virtue are cause and effect and can never be the same [14072-14074].

Still, it is taught this way, and you should understand it thus. If you have wisdom, there is something extremely important here.

First, with pure vision purifying previous attachment's mind, you remember past lives—hundreds with pure, a thousand simultaneously with pure, a hundred thousand with extremely pure, and seven hundred twenty thousand simultaneously with supremely pure, like holding fresh fruit in your palm [14076-14080].

With pure vision of future delusion being exhausted, you know the characteristics of the body taken in past lives [14081-14082]. With pure, speech; with extremely pure, mind; with supremely pure, all three body, speech, and mind simultaneously [14083-14085].

With complete knowledge of disciples' mind vision, you see countless sentient beings' body characteristics [14086-14087].

Emaho!
