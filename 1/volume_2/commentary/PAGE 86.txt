...clear light's self-essence appearing, experience not deceiving, making measure. Unlike six applications, etcetera.

Wind-essence and awareness-essence have distinction—like jewel light and lamp light. Even making delusion-appearance awareness-power impure essence path doesn't liberate. Making pure appearance clear light actual essence path liberates.

Distinguishing examples: from Vinishcaya—"Jewel and lamp light, jewel mind directly flows, wrong knowing no distinction, but how functionally distinct." Thus said.

Thus, distinctive greatness seven, countless details, surpassing. Thalgyur says: "Dharmata direct pith also, realize no good-bad action, heart-essence definite summary, faculties no sharp-dull, deliberation word extreme exhausted, not wisdom sense-power sees, words don't see dharmata, common vehicles don't accomplish meaning, three bodies path appearance."

Emaho! Clear light beyond all obscuration!
