[17307-17310]
Ah, here we are! Look at this—Longchenpa is signing his name to the work, but not with pride, with devotion. "Rab gsal blo gros"—the one with brilliant intelligence, stainless, following the noble path. He's describing himself through his qualities, not his ego. This is how a true master speaks: through the Dharma, not about himself.

And look who he's offering this to: "mang thos yon tan shin tu rgya che"—those who have heard much, whose qualities are vast, who desire awakening in one lifetime. This is you! If you've made it to this page, if you've held this text in your hands, if these words have entered your ears—Longchenpa wrote this for you. This supreme vehicle, this door to the unsurpassable—he placed it as a treasure (*mdzod*) right here, as ornament for the crown of faith.

Emaho! Like the jewels of the naga kings, this text is precious beyond measure. It doesn't belong in a dusty library—it belongs in your heart!

[17311-17314]
Listen to these praises! The speech of the Buddha, stainless qualities, the peak of unsurpassable vehicles—this is the secret treasury of the Victorious Ones (*rgyal ba'i gsang mdzod*), wondrous and amazing. This treasury of jewels is difficult to manifest in the world. But here it is, appearing before you!

Like the udumbara flower that blooms once in an age—wondrous and rare—this text appears for those with fortune (*skal bzangs*). And whoever hears this, whoever holds it, whoever lets it penetrate their mind—they are the great bodhisattvas of the final existence. This isn't exaggeration! This is the power of the Dharma. Just to encounter this teaching plants the seed of liberation.

[17315-17318]
White Dharma shining vast, adorned with the auspicious mandala of sun and moon—this is the offering. Space and time, the secret peak of the Victorious Ones, auspicious light rays equal to the limits of space—this is the vision. Buddha activity without limit, fulfilling all hopes and desires—this is the prayer. The piled-up auspiciousness of the glorious sun of auspiciousness—may there be auspiciousness in all times!

Don't skip over these verses as mere poetry. This is the completion, the sealing of the work. When you finish a great Dharma text, you dedicate the merit. You don't just close the book and walk away—you offer it to all beings. This is the bodhisattva path in action.

[17319-17324]
"The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasury"—this is its name. Through limitless, immeasurable Dharma topics, the meaning of the result is definitively established. This place of unexcelled secret essence, luminosity, vajra heart—this is what you've been reading. This vast collection of the Tathagata's speech, the ocean of philosophical positions of self and other transcended—this is the work of the Omniscient Lord of Speech (*kun mkhyen ngag gi dbang po*), Longchenpa himself.

Completed! (*rdzogs so*)

Take a moment. Breathe. You've reached the end of one of the most profound texts ever written in Tibetan Buddhism. Not just read it—completed it. This is a milestone in your spiritual life. Don't let it pass unnoticed.

[17325-17327]
Dge'o! Dge'o! Dge'o! Virtue! Virtue! Virtue!

Three times he proclaims it. Not just "good luck"—this is the celebration of merit. Each time you encounter the Dharma, virtue arises. Each time you practice, virtue increases. Each time you realize, virtue is perfected.

[17328-17330]
And finally, the Dharani of Dependent Origination in Sanskrit:

*Om ye dharma hetu prabhava hetun tesam tathagato hyavadat*
*tesam ca yo nirodha evam vadi mahasramanah*

"Of all phenomena that arise from causes, the Tathagata has taught their cause, and their cessation too—thus speaks the Great Shramana."

This is the seal, the authentication. Everything that arose in this text arose from causes—the cause being Longchenpa's wisdom and compassion. And now it is complete. The work is done.

But for you? Now the real work begins. This isn't the end—it's the beginning. Take what you've learned and practice it. Turn knowledge into realization. Don't let this Treasury gather dust—let it transform your mind!

Sarva Mangalam. May all be auspicious.
