Listen! Now Longchenpa brings the Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror tantra to drive the point home. These aren't just pretty metaphors— they're precise instructions on how afflictions bind you, and how wisdom liberates.

"Aho! Vajra holder, listen!" The tantra addresses you directly. Wake up!

"Immature conceptions in samsara—like a corpse bound in iron." Feel this! Your rigid thoughts, your fixed ideas about reality—they're the iron chains. Not liberated, the time of liberation doesn't arise. As long as ignorance binds you like this, you won't change, won't transform.

"Ignorance is like water—afflictions gather." Just as water collects in low places, ignorance is the ground where all afflictions pool. "Anger is fire like an eon-ending conflagration." It burns everything! "Desire for things is like drinking salt water." The more you indulge, the more you thirst—never satisfied.

"Delusion is thick like darkness in an empty house." You can't see anything clearly. "Pride and arrogance like a crushing mountain." It weighs you down, flattens you. "Jealousy and ill-will like a narrow ravine gorge." Trapped, constricted, no room to move.

These five afflictions obscure wisdom. But look deeper—mind is like a bitch thief, consciousness like a forest monkey, mind like impure mud, all-ground like a being-pig, knowing like a feather carried by wind. Grasping and grasped like man and woman entangled. Karma's varieties like birds caught in a net. Suffering's varieties like ripples on water.

The result of affliction? No method to endure it! This samsaric suffering, this spear of grasping-grasped—by doing you won't get out. But by placing awareness, you go out!

Emaho! The secret mantra king transforms afflictions into wisdom! Like raising a lamp in an empty house—the wisdom lamp makes ignorance known. Not by fighting it, not by suppressing it, but by recognizing its nature. This is the path, friend!
