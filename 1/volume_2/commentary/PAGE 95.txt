How guidance accomplishes: Outer—buddhas' and bodhisattvas' blessings, speech and mind accept—cause, name, mantra appear as conduct, vow as connection. Middle—treasure revealers' realization and communication of dakas, language teaching in high realms. Inner—yogis' accomplishment of realization path and abiding liberation.

Three speeds: Great middle path—Narayana: sixteen lifetimes eight months. Garlands: thirteen lifetimes. Sukhavati: three lifetimes two months. This shows benefit of entering supreme path—donkey eons become finger-snap time.

From Tantras: "Students with merit obtain Buddhahood this very lifetime." Gradual paths get stuck at boundaries—supreme path directly takes them to realization, no obstacles.

Then main practice: gathering and release. Gathering vital points through hearing—received blessings of guru and yidam, transmission through speech and mind, language enters as hearing. Release through mantra application—mantra recitation through channel-winds entering wisdom expanse—no obstacles.

Emaho! Gradual in donkey eons, instant in this lifetime!
