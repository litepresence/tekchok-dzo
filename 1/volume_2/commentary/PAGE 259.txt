Fortunate one, pay attention! One without signs who claims confidence in self-appearing nature [11274-11283]—this is mere intellectual view and meditation. Such a person cannot liberate and will remain long in samsara.

But for thodgal practitioners [11284-11291], these signs arise as certain liberation without deception. Therefore exert special effort! One who matures space and awareness—how could these signs not arise? Apply yourself diligently!

Now the text summarizes [11292-11310] signs of liberation and buddhahood versus signs of taking rebirth through the six realms' confusion. Two aspects: brief presentation and extensive explanation.

The brief [11311-11337]: even if dharmata is realized directly, without sufficient effort one may not reach measure. When the material body separates, without taking further existence, one is liberated from contaminants. The signs: body relics, self-arisen images, great light and sound display, manifest buddhahood!

This is the Great Perfection's unique path—recognition in this life, liberation in this life! Like finding a wish-fulfilling jewel in your own pocket, you discover you possessed the treasure all along.

Emaho!
