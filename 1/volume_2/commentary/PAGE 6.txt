[265-283] (continuation from PAGE 5)
The verse continues explaining the completeness teaching: the moving projecting wind is self-aware awakening, great bliss. The seed from the five causes arises appearing from the field of emptiness. The equipoise of bliss is wisdom arisen from method. Entering the womb is self-awareness arising from the base.

Seven sets of seven days is the measure of realization. Ten months traverses the grounds. Birth is arising as kaya. Producing the body is base-appearing field. Abiding in body is abiding in the base. Aging is awakening confusion from delusion. Sickness is confidence of realization. Death is liberation into Dharma-nature empty.

This is the revolutionary Dzogchen view: your life IS the path. Every ordinary experience, when recognized, is an enlightened experience. You're not trying to get somewhere else—you're recognizing where you already are!

[284-297] (continuation)
The particular manner of reversing delusion: birth is awareness moving from dimension; body is the base; outer appearances are base-appearing spontaneous completion. Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face. Aging is awakening from truth-clinging confusion. Death, knowing self-face, shows arrival at primordial purity.

These arise primordially, so: instruction introduces, empowerment matures, meditation liberates. If you're already complete in partial similarity, you need the instruction to point it out clearly. This is what Buddha's Dharma does—it shows you what you already have. The base-path exists primordially in its complete measure.

[298-313]
Now the second topic: completeness in body and mind specifically. This has three parts: body, mind, and awareness.

First, the body: this aggregate of four gathered elements contains everything. The outer container-world—the universe—and the inner essence-migrants—all beings—are complete right here in your body.

From the Mutik Trengwa (Pearl Garland): Earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, moon, forms of males and females, planets, stars, clouds, trees, mountains, rocks, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, smells, tastes, sounds, touches...

Longchenpa is listing everything in the universe and saying: it's all in your body. This isn't exaggeration. In the completion stage, you realize that your channels, winds, and essences correspond to cosmic structures. Your body is a mandala. The microcosm mirrors the macrocosm perfectly.

When you understand this, practices like tummo (inner fire), the various yogas of channels and winds—they're not just physical exercises. You're working with the cosmic elements concentrated in your vajra body.
