Gaze awareness at sky empty—field compatible with sky, experience empty, clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast dawns. From Mind Section: yogin abides in sky's bird-path. From Collection: make gaze at sky-only for that meaning. From Middle Mother: transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation is making sky-yogin. Field outer-inner mixed, called equal limitless view; dhatu-awareness non-dual view; dhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana taste equal view. From Instruction-Child: dhatu and awareness gaze manner, sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.

Wind-awareness main point: when field and gate meet, rely on slow wind—called capturing awareness. Slow wind shoots outer far, holds outer place. Wind and slow cause: outer becomes yogin's life-extending helper; inner makes conceptuality cease; secret does awareness direct seeing action; actual makes buddha, not seeing contaminated. From Thalgyur: make wind somehow slow, arising from fully projecting, body and mind connection cut, not reversing even in three realms. Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplishes.

Awareness main point: hanging-cord, dhatu fence, not-move. From Self-face awareness: hanging-cord, going-coming separate, sky capture. From Instruction-Child: dhatu inside hanging-cord, place arrange, not separate. Relying on slow wind, action separate meaning arises in mind. Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead, conceptuality source exhausted. Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet. Awareness separate from wind, going-coming not-existing—self-arisen awareness enters.

Emaho! Sky, wind, awareness—the three meet in your own heart!
