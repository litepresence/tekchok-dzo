[4749-4751] Listen, dear friend! Empty sky, awareness empty place—field sky accord, experience empty-clear, free from elaboration, wonderful appears! Entity characteristics-free purpose exists!

[4752-4760] From Mind School: "Yogi abides in sky's bird-path!" From Condensed: "Analyze meaning that in empty sky!" From Middle Mother: "Meditating prajna paramita is sky yoga!" These citations immeasurable!

[4761-4763] Also outer-inner mixed equal, limitless view called. Dharmadhatu-awareness non-dual view called. Dharmadhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana equal-taste view called!

Do you see? Sky-like! No bird-path tracks! No meditation object! Just sky-like awareness!

Emaho! Sky-like view of Great Perfection!
