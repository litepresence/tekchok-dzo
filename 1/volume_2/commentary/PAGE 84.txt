Listen! Now for those free from elaboration, I show the secret great Vajra Essence path of Rigpa's self-appearance. Two aspects: how it definitely surpasses common vehicles, and explaining the distinctive path itself.

First, seven pith points of surpassing: Other paths need great wisdom, quickly realized but small liberation—not liberated. This path's pith of seeing sense-power—effort great or small, no sharp-dull faculties. Others intellectually deliberate dharmata, confidence in empty meditation like throwing dark stones. This doesn't rely on mind's deliberation—directly existent like direct perception, not relying on deliberation.

Others rely on progressive word expression, hoping to realize meaning primordially. This doesn't rely on even one letter of words—meaning directly seen, words don't make buddha. Others make natural state's meaning mind's object, analyzing ground-path-fruit over time. This self-clear directly becomes—not relying on mind-made thought ground-path, becoming buddha.

Others rely on cause-effect before-after, seeking enlightenment elsewhere. This doesn't rely on cause-effect good-bad action—enlightenment self-dawning, no effort or acceptance-rejection. Others spread channels-winds-bindus in youth, accomplishing enlightenment, but power exhausted in old age—not liberated. This self-arisen clear light sun-moon dawns within—with effort, no old-young age, razor pith.

Others regard final fruit as three bodies. This three bodies dawn as path appearance—final clear light primordially pure vastness, spontaneously accomplished Rigpa definitely established.

Emaho! Seven piths cutting through all limitations!
