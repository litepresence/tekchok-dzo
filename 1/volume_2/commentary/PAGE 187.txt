Self-liberated self-pacified vast expanse—from that same source: "Therefore ground-abiding rigpa, self-dawn thus appearance complete. Self-arisen thus ground itself complete. Self-appearance thus objects also complete. Self-liberated thus delusion-ground complete. Self-pure thus all paths complete. Self-knowing thus knowables complete. Self-pervasive thus result complete. Self-place thus cause-conditions complete. Self-realized thus dharmata complete. Self-reversed thus samsara-nirvana complete. Self-abiding thus tantra-scripture complete. Self-complete thus one-time complete. Self-aware thus instruction complete. Self-placed thus meditation complete. Self-nature thus expanse complete."

Thus completed and liberated rigpa itself primordially pure from first, stainless. Heart, thus transmission exhausted. Single great bliss beyond speech-thought-expression. Primordially pure wide-open. Stone-enclosed pure emptiness. Generally appearing samsara-nirvana's fortune unmoved. Dharma-exhausted change-ceased beyond inanimate-animate. Abiding as natural ground-Buddha.

From Pearl Garland: "Emaho! Self-completed Great Perfection dharmakaya—pure from ka, stains exhausted. First arisen, transmission exhausted. Free from duality, beyond calculation. Suffering causeless, great bliss. Expression causeless, beyond speech-thought. Primordially self-aware pure. Exhausted overflow, not stone-enclosed. Exhausted things, abides empty. Both without increase, nature itself. Free from dharmas, beyond method. Unthought clear, change ceased."

Emaho! All completed in self-nature!
