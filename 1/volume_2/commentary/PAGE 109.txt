If guide, rely on body main point—do five-six days. Then practice gate, only that much. Then seek field, six-seven days. Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience. Very purified, meditation knowing arises. Wrong or not-wrong cause, see flickering vision, no faith—when guide finishes, nothing to say. Various divinations arise near—make pure those not gone thus. General guide applied: preliminary measure arrives, purify with diligence, actual main faith, not ordinary, arises.

First Samantabhadra, equal capacity. When habituation arrives at measure—liberating with stone into light. If not arrived, traverse bardo or nature-emanation field; cut six-realms' delusion precipice. From Self-Arising Instruction: whoever sees, this person, first Samantabhadra, capacity itself is equal. From Thalgyur: hanging-cord nature is; by all conceptuality pure, base-buddha, not deluded.

Vision's dawning manner: dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawns, bind tiny point to hanging-cord. From first white-pure star-scatter like, point possessing five colors, each one, three-bind interval vision until that. Look at outer luminous-clear, inner conceptuality separate, equal limitless liberating. Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance and spontaneous-completion light-resonance—outer-inner pair connect, called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent. Vision four dawning sequence: briefly show essence, extensively explain nature.

[4846-4857]
When all four visions, body in posture, eye gazing, wind-awareness mode slow, three main points harmonize. First two visions purify; later two not relying on effort, mode purify, liberate into luminous-clear—called dhatu-awareness non-dual. Main points arise from not doing—separate awareness vajra hanging-cord. Awareness essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable, base-abide, that resonance, light channel pure vision, like golden thread coil, curve interval point bind. Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings, essence not good-bad, equal unchanging.

Emaho! The golden thread of awareness connects all—nothing separate!
