[3883-3897]
Three realms primordially pure—all door-three's fixation-thought, karma and latencies, pure as great self-liberation, obtaining intention free of samsara-nirvana hope. From that: "Upon mind without worry, appearance without hope—called confidence-relaxation intention. Samantabhadra teaches. Upon mind without appearance aspect, singular subtle appearance—called great freedom-from-elaboration intention. Samantabhadra teaches."

Fourth, afflictions self-liberated result: when afflictions and thought-concepts arise, they cannot remain, without pair, directly self-liberated—like water ripples or snake knots self-calming.

See? You don't have to do anything! Afflictions liberate themselves when you don't grasp them!

Emaho! Like a snake untying its own knots!
