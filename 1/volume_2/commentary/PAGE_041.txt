[2097-2146] Now listen carefully, brave yogin! The second topic: extensively explaining the twenty-one natures of secret great definite conduct and the progressive practice of vajra song and dance.

First, from the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra, these twenty-one conducts:

By bee-like conduct, enjoy all dharmas' taste; by deer-like conduct, abandon delusion's conditioned objects; by mute-like conduct, abandon various delusion speech; by peacock-like conduct, cut secret mantra doubt; by madman-like conduct, abandon dwelling on single objects; by lion-like conduct, go to charnel-grounds and abandon fear mind; by dog and pig-like conduct, abandon pure and impure thoughts; by cloud-like conduct, experience memory and thought instantly; by child-like conduct, abandon long delusion clinging; by echo-like conduct, guide the world according to words; by elephant-like conduct, turn the depth of samsara's battles; by deer-like conduct (again), abandon son and enemy concepts; by tortoise-like conduct, decide desire's content in time; by bear-like conduct, do not spread samsara's seed; by brahmin-like conduct, abandon enjoying others' food; by heroine-like conduct, divide samsara-nirvana boundary; by water-letter-like conduct, place memory support in self-place; by sky-dagger conduct, completely use phenomena; by mid-air wind-like conduct, abandon grasping and holding thoughts; by garuda-like conduct, cut abyss waves; by mountain-like conduct, above use unchanging self-pure; by thunder-like conduct, use appearance outward without turning.

Thus twenty-two enumeration exists, although two deer-like conducts gather as one—explained as twenty-one.

[2147-2168] Second: the three aspects of vajra song and dance progressively—song dance time, song dance actuality, song dance benefit.

First: the time of conduct that divides samsara-nirvana boundary, and accumulation, and empowerment, and mandala accomplishment time, and samadhi above spreading time—these five kinds of pure time, ordinary beings cannot see, done secretly. From that itself: whatever yogin possesses fortune, when time comes to go in charnel-grounds, again and again take up vajra song, dwell in non-thought meditation with companions. Before going to all conduct, therefore itself take vajra song, enter accumulation, empowerment, mandala—that time diligently do song. Time relies on non-think mind; this occasion itself should take it up.

[2169-2177] Particularly: the supreme explains mind settling and dullness cutting. From that: whatever meditation you enter, this settle-enter it is. If yogin experiences dullness, cutting this samadhi is good—self-rigpa's great bliss beats, linking mahamudra itself.

Emaho! Twenty-one conducts! All are skillful means to cut through fixation. Don't cling to any one—use them all as paths to freedom!
