Now hear this, night practitioner! [9143-9167] Going to sleep, place mind in the expanse of empty bindus dissolving in the skull's space, and recognize sleep's clear light. At midnight, hold mind to heart's inner clear light and sleep, dreams dissolve into clear light and habitual patterns' continuum is cut. Then at dawn with lion's gaze, place awareness upon a white AH in bow-length space—clarity-emptiness free of elaboration dawns from within. Rest in that state as long as possible—this is the meditation.

[9168-9183] From the Klong Drugpa: "Compressing body's posture, throw awareness into space's expanse. Thus eyes in mid-space with elephant's gaze, place non-meditation's great expansion. Rigpa thus thrown into space, without separation from this, the yogin continuously meditating day expands displays. Night in own dwelling place, to measure four equal times, gather sense doors, place mind on lamp of empty bindus—when bindu expands, awareness also expands; when bindu becomes fine, place awareness finer and finer. Through sleep and dream's crucial point, earlier grasping habits are extracted from root. Thus at night times, the fortunate yogin acts—this reaches display's self-expansion."

[9184-9208] Thus practiced day and night in rotation, deluded displays self-liberate, liberating into clear light. From that: "Body, objects, and rigpa measure pure self-display. Having measured thus self-display, six realms' deluded displays cease. When that itself ceases, rigpa reaches the measure. Thus when reaching measure, one's own body also unseen. Elements-created flesh-blood body, elements pure in their own place, therefore unseen as object. Deluded grasping mind's body, elements awakened in their own place, this too unseen, dissolving in own place."

Emaho!
