Listen, devoted one! Now I teach you the seven introductions to light and wisdom [9973-10010]! The self-light of wisdom appears as five lights moving from space - through this you are introduced to your own light!

From this arises outer-clear appearance as space-wisdom-display! Like a mirror and the five other examples - recognize your own appearances! The connecting thread-ray between, the three bodies connected as one, wisdom self-appearing from clear-appearance, the mother-child measure of awareness from colored dust, and the heart-interval appearance of wisdom from the human female - these seven introductions!

Second, look at the bindu and body introductions! In the bindu appears the five wisdoms' display, pure bindu-appearances arising as five. Through copper vessel essence, the bindu itself is introduced. Through cloth surface, wisdom's light appears!

Through swirling water, the intermediate state first-appearance is introduced! Through peacock mirror, the intention! Through stirred copper vessel, the nine-stacked bindu of great bliss Brahma's gate!

Dear practitioner, there are two bodies: Awareness Youth Vase Body and Youth Wrathful Frown-Possessing Body. These also are half-bodies, single self, collection mandala - being and being female, father-mother pair connected - thus seven!

Third, the awareness and space introductions! Awareness introduction has two: three bodies as inseparable, and father-mother mouth-joining emanation-proliferation. This is awareness ripened as body!

Emaho!
