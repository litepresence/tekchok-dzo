Listen, fortunate disciple! The signs of past purification are shown now [10211-10256]! From the Glorious Sky Without Body Blaze Great Tantra: as perfect Buddhas' body signs and speech signs, so too vajra mind signs - as before arose, so here all sentient beings' bodies show these!

To whom they appear - those with fortune of past purification! From not ripening before, now certain fruit! By whom accomplished - to that person body signs and speech signs, mind signs arise!

Body signs: conch right swirl or three-point frown vertical at forehead center, OM marks, lines, self-protruding! Speech signs: throat right and woman's left lotus petal eight, conch right swirl, silk tongue, hook, sword, AH marks!

Mind signs: heart center vajra, wheel, three-point complexion, jewel shape, HUM letter! These signs all arise from suitability - from base, body-speech-mind exist self, before purified, now arise!

Even butcher and lower trade unsuitable ones - from base body-speech-mind exist, from that before familiar, above intermediate obstacle enter, above body-speech-mind signs - these all arise!

Dear one, if familiar with these signs, quickly liberate body-speech-mind in this life! With body signs, purify body now, obtain vajra body in two lives! With speech, accomplish vajra speech in two births! With mind familiar, accomplish in three!

Emaho!
