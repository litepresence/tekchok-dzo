No liberation cause or condition other than appearance. Liberated groundless—no abiding support, no root. Rootless mind itself—from Secret Heart: "This rootless mind itself—not male, not female, not neuter; not color, not shape; no mark, no class."

That itself no return place other than itself. No going place—never experienced birth. No arising place—nothing other than itself not self, called self-liberation.

Like snake's knot self-liberated without anyone untying.

Third: naked liberation depending on seeing-release key, showing no dependence on tantra-scripture. Just by naked seeing, liberated in that—mother-child meeting liberation. Appearance itself unmixed by mind, uncut by appearance, placed—self-pure liberated.

Naked liberation seeing-release has four: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode; example.

Understanding: just by naked seeing, liberated in seeing that—first instant self-seen? Heard? Just by knowing—dharmata direct count reached!

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: no appearance mind-mixing, so basis-empty; empty-appearance equal; equal emptiness-appearance; awareness-appearance unseparated; equal-awareness; experience-liberation equal—so naked seeing.

Emaho! Liberated by naked seeing alone!
