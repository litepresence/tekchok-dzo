Listen well, devoted practitioner! Longchenpa now teaches about the third aspect of mind unmoving - and this is crucial for your practice!

"Conceptuality not arise, thought generation cease, mind substance dharmata naked dawn!" What does this mean? When conceptual mind stops creating, awareness reveals itself naturally! The "mind substance" (*sems kyi rdzas*): This isn't some mysterious essence - it's the nature of mind itself, dharmata, naked and revealed!

"Example bee inside jar like, jar bind-from move not, that-like conceptuality not arise, appearance aspect mind clear-from bind do!" Oh, how perfect this analogy is! The bee trapped in a jar can't fly - but it can buzz against the glass. Similarly, your conceptuality can't arise when awareness holds it in clarity! The "appearance aspect" of mind isn't trapped - it's liberated into its natural brightness!

Now the physical practices: "Navel wisdom fire-from mind little turn-from coarse conceptuality clear light purify do!" When you warm the navel wisdom fire, subtle mind moves, and coarse conceptuality naturally purifies into clear light!

[5755–5768]
"Secret place channel little press-from emission reverse bliss wisdom-from not separate do!" This isn't about physical pressure - it's about recognizing how all experiences are wisdom manifesting!

"Navel fire burn-from red bindu melt-from crown white bodhicitta fall-from four joys arise, joy thought generation cease-from dharmata clear light dawn!" The four joys aren't physical sensations to cultivate! They naturally arise when conceptual thinking ceases and dharmata reveals itself as clear light!

[5769–5780]
"Thus example dream clear-from wake like, mind appear aspect clear light purify-from dharmata naked dawn basis do!" Like waking from dream - when clarity dawns, you see the dream was never real! The "appearance aspect" of mind purifies into clear light, revealing dharmata nakedly!

"Mudra partner practice-from that similar do, external bliss generate-from internal bindu melt-from wisdom clear light dawn!" External practices can support this, but the real practice is internal recognition!

But practitioner be careful! "Without knowing nature, merely bliss attachment generate-from animal birth cause become!" If you grasp at bliss experiences without recognizing their nature, you create more bondage!

"Therefore emptiness compassion not separate essence know-from bliss empty like appearance enjoy do!" The key: compassion and emptiness are inseparable! When you recognize bliss as empty appearance, you naturally express compassion!

Emaho! Conceptuality is the thief that steals your wisdom - let awareness unmoving reveal the naked dawn!
