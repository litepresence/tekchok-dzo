View maturation! Ten ways of seeing emptiness.

First four: outer, inner, secret, very secret. Outer: like sun of light—sees emptiness in all appearances, unstained by appearances. Inner: like moon of light—sees emptiness in duality, unstained. Secret: like butter lamp—sees emptiness within phenomena, unstained. Very secret: like eye medicine—sees emptiness through powers, unstained.

Six combinations! You can mix these ways according to capacity and interest, like arranging food for different tastes. Not limited to fixed progression.

Then six yogas: Yogacara's path includes all vehicles' conduct—Buddha taught gradually according to beings' capacities. But Dzogchen includes all six as natural: conduct yoga accumulates merit, etc.

Maturation's benefit: Without view maturation, you can't obtain siddhis in this lifetime. Like farmer without eyes—can't find gold even if walking over it.

Emaho! Ten ways to see one emptiness!
