You who seek the truth, listen! The third topic explains how clairvoyance arises—six types: clairvoyance of sense faculties, mind-made clairvoyance, wisdom-controlled clairvoyance, pure wisdom vision clairvoyance, seeing dharmata unmistakenly clairvoyance, and seeing Buddha's knowledge unmistakenly clairvoyance [13975-13981].

Each of these can be divided into six parts, making thirty-six.

First, the six sense faculty clairvoyances: The first is eye clairvoyance arising. From the purified bubble-eye, without half-closing, you see all substances as pure from the ground [13983-13985]. With the flesh eye purified, you see coarse hidden objects within five miles [13986]. With the completely purified flesh eye, you see one continent with Mount Meru [13987]. With extremely purified, you see two or three. With supremely purified, you see up to thousands and hundreds of thousands [13988-13989].

With the wisdom eye, you simultaneously see hundreds of nirmanakaya realms [13991]. With pure, you see eight hundred thousand nirmanakaya realms [13992]. With extremely pure, you see millions [13993]. With supremely pure, you see nine hundred million [13994-13995].

With the all-knowing eye, simultaneously see hundreds of sambhogakaya realms [13996]. With pure, see fifty million [13997]. With extremely pure, see five billion [13998].

Emaho!
