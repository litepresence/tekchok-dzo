Upon these outer-inner phenomena difference not existing. Holding as true—what use? All are illusion-reflection appearance—knowing this with non-distracted aspiration, meditate whatever appears as illusion-reflection, and. Especially upon one's own form appearing in mirror.

How people many midst, illusionist by forms emanate and, horse elephant chariot various make, like various appearance not-true upon that. Phenomena all thus know do. How water-field moist tree, though person cuts that for desire of essence, inside and outside—all essence not exist. Phenomena all thus know do. Thus it is.

Emaho! Illusory body daytime!
