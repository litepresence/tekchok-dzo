This is called the bodhisattva's breath-transference manner! Rebirth too is born with happiness. If not, understand thus for those with exhausted karma. Thus the twenty-five winds: the five elements dissolve into dharmadhatu, and samsara and nirvana are liberated. The five wisdoms naturally perfect, the five kayas spontaneously present! Don't look for them elsewhere—they're right here, right now, in your own body and mind!

Emaho! The winds carry the mind—like clouds carry the rain!
