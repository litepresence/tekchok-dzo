Thus by seven greatnesses, surpassing all from Sravakas to outer-inner nine levels of Secret Mantra. "But isn't this Ati?" you ask. Does it surpass Ati?

From Ati's mind-space-instruction three sections: Mind-section expands ground-free confidence—Rigpa directly seen, mind instant self-clearly abiding, unchanging nine changes dawned ultimately. But actually not seen, only deliberation—not surpassing because pith not directly seen.

Instruction-section's outer, inner, secret, three bardos rely on times. This has light-body liberation pith—therefore distinctively surpasses.

In brief, pith is inconceivable, surpassing, but words can't express—therefore not elaborated here.

Channels-winds pith: common ones use channels-winds conventional coarse as path—body training, many effortful, obstacles and errors many. This abandons coarse—three unmoving piths only binding, not making them path. Ultimate wisdom channels-winds beyond holding-effort made path—body training purified into light, not relying on common mandala-obstacle-removal. Obstacles are delusion, suffering—they arise from delusion channels-winds as path. This makes ultimate non-delusion path—no obstacles or errors.

Errors: intellect-made deliberation not seeing meaning, same view two aspects and experience aspects erring, making experience-knowledge chief—error-obstacle narrow path not transcending. This directly seen by sense-power, no error-place, arrived directly at meaning.

Error arises on path seeking meaning—this doesn't have that. Delusion-place doesn't exist here—experience knowledge ma-ri instant change-return not making path measure...

Emaho! Beyond all error and delusion!
