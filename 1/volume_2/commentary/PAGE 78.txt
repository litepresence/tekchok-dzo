Thalgyur tantra speaks: "Terminology of expressions and names: outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed view—four. Outer is view of dharmic-possessors, eight stages, mind's desire—holding to deliberation and investigation. Inner looks at dharmata—face and nature seen as illusion. Secret looks at self-awareness—seeing linked coils of dependent origination. Suchness is expanse-awareness."

See the progression? Outer looks at things, inner looks at nature, secret looks at awareness itself, unsurpassed looks at—what? Nothing! The looking and the looked-at both dissolve.

The four aspects of natural view: view of abiding—samsara-nirvana liberated from the start. View of pure seeing—beyond cause-effect and effort. View of nature—appearance-existence appearing as spontaneously liberated. Unmodified view—great vast expanse beyond extremes. From that same source: "Furthermore, dharmata wheel explained..."

Don't get lost in these classifications! They're fingers pointing—don't suck the fingers, look where they point!

Emaho! Four views, one reality!
