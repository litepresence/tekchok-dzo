From the Sound Thalgyur: by training in the sound-meaning of elements, common attainments are obtained. This is referring to how the elements manifest as sounds, and by understanding their meaning, you gain powers and abilities. 

The particularities: training in form exhausts the body (you see through its solidity), knowing languages through sound, taking essence through smell, transforming entities into nectar through taste. These are completion stage practices!

From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: by becoming familiar with the sounds and meanings of earth, water, fire, and wind, you understand the self-sounds of the six races (types of beings), and clairvoyance arises. Each being, each realm, has its own elemental signature. Understanding this gives you insight into all realms.

These outer elements are the support and abode of all sentient beings. This completes the tenfold presentation of outer elements.

[240-258]
Tenth: how samsara and nirvana are complete in the yogi's body and mind. This is the profound Dzogchen teaching of completeness (*tshang tshul*).

First, the general presentation: in the gathered body and mind of migrators, all primordially self-arises complete:
- Father and mother = method and wisdom
- Karma wind projecting = Dharmakaya awakening
- Five element seeds = five families' sound-potential  
- Two essences of equipoise = union of method-wisdom of path's two accumulations
- Abiding in womb = abiding in base-dimension
- Body forming in seven sets of seven days = completing seven paths of seven pure elements
- Ten months in womb = completing ten grounds
- Becoming Buddha in three kayas = completing the path
- Birth = emanation-body
- Abiding engaging fields = enjoyment-body
- Death = arising of Dharma-nature empty

This is the profound teaching: your entire life—conception, gestation, birth, aging, death—mirrors the path to enlightenment. Every stage corresponds to a stage of the path!

[259-283]
From the Mutik Trengwa, the Bhagavan speaks:

Not liberated by effort—don't try to create liberation!
Abiding liberated from primordial—you're already free!
From union of method and wisdom—father and mother are the cause.
The moving projecting wind—self-aware awakening, great bliss.
The seed from five causes—arises appearing from emptiness field.
Equipoise of bliss of the two—wisdom arisen from method.
Entering womb—self-awareness arising from base.
Seven sets of seven—measure of realization.
Ten months—traversing the grounds.
Birth—arising as kaya.
Producing body—base-appearing field.
Abiding in body—the base.
Aging—awakening confusion from delusion.
Sickness—confidence of realization.
Death—liberation into Dharma-nature empty.

All appearing sentient beings—primordially liberated without effort!

This is it! The whole path is already complete in your life. Birth, life, death—they're not obstacles; they ARE the path when recognized.

[284-297]
Connecting with reversing delusion:
- Birth = awareness moving from dimension
- Body = the base
- Outer appearances = base-appearing spontaneous completion
- Sickness = realization meeting face-to-face
- Aging = awakening confusion from truth-clinging
- Death = final arrival at primordial purity ground

These arise primordially, so instruction introduces you to them, empowerment matures you, and meditation liberates. 

If complete in partial similarity, you can't liberate through instruction alone—you need to be shown clearly that this partial similarity exists. This is Buddha's Dharma. The base-path is primordially complete. What Buddha teaches as symbols points to this essence.

[298-313]
Second: completeness in body and mind specifically—threefold: body, mind, and awareness.

First, body: in this aggregate of four gathered elements, the outer container-world and inner essence-migrants are all complete. From the Mutik Trengwa: earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, moon, forms of beings, planets, stars, clouds, trees, mountains, rocks, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, smells, tastes, sounds, touches—all are present in the body!

Your body is a complete universe. Everything outside is also inside. This isn't metaphor—it's the actual structure of manifestation.
