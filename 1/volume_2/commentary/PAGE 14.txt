[685-705] Three aspects of expansion—first, completion. From Self-Arising: in the pure appearance of three kayas, one complete, two complete, all complete! Wisdom appearing unceasing and clear. Don't you see? It's not that you have to complete something—it's already complete! Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating. In awareness free from concept, five lights unceasing and clear. In great self-liberation without grasping, outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.

Listen to this carefully: "In awareness released from action, actor and acted complete in single moment." Not gradually, not step by step—in one moment! In awareness separated from mind, all variety complete. In great clear purity, deluded appearances complete. In great self-liberated self-appearance, other-arisen dharmas complete. Such is the manner of three kayas' completion. Not something you're working toward—what you already are!

[706-714] Awakening—what does it mean? Being without dualistic grasping. From the same nature:
- Without action, delusion awakens
- Without concept, afflictions awaken
- Without grasping, self-arising awakens
- Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens
- Without attachment, ignorance awakens

See the pattern? Nothing to do, nowhere to go! Just stop grasping and what was confused awakens to what it always was. This is the manner of three kayas' awakening!

[715-727] Expansion—qualities primordially accomplished, spontaneously expansive. From Self-Arising:
- In awareness free from concept, five lights clear, wisdom expansive
- In awareness free from actor/acted, three kayas expand without perceived object
- In awareness appearing without object, five lights expand without grasping mind
- In awareness great wisdom, self-appearance with meaning, fruit expands

Not acquiring qualities—recognizing what already is!

[728-750] Now the expansive explanation of place—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya has ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent.

Essence: empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence. Unchanging, cessation without, pervading three—this is dharmakaya essence. Definition: expanse primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya. Essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion.

Emaho! Three kayas complete, awakened, and expansive right now!
