Listen! The two lights teaching—these are extraordinary! Dzogchen's ground instruction showing its supremacy over all vehicles.

Outer light: Shining through dharmas—Buddha's light illuminates all appearances like sunlight through dust motes. Its five ways: outer, inner, secret, identity, ultimate.

Outer dharmas: scriptural teachings as sounds—emptiness taught but needing eons to perfect. Outer teaching through meaning—phenomenal emptiness explained through reasoning. Inner teaching through symbols—dakini's songs reveal emptiness directly. Secret teaching through non-conceptual—essence appearances as bliss emptiness.

Inner light: Shining through awareness—self-radiant, perceiving emptiness. Five outer modes: emanating, teaching, demonstrating, subduing, establishing. Two inner modes: self-emanating and mantra-emanating. Secret mode: conjoined bliss emptiness.

This shows Dzogchen contains both sutra and mantra approaches—not limited to one path.

Emaho! Two lamps dissolve into one light!
