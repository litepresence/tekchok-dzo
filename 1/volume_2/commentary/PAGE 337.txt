You seekers of truth, attend! The third, wisdom-controlled clairvoyance six, are: wisdom vision free of intellect, free of words, free of conception, free of investigation, characteristic-analyzing wisdom vision, and characteristic-free wisdom vision [14106-14121].

Being free of intellect, you see your own mind's characteristics instantaneously [14113]. With pure, see self and other; with extremely pure, see self and other both; with supremely pure, see all remaining without exception [14114-14115].

Free of words wisdom vision: simultaneously see the words of the tripitaka teachings [14116]. With pure, know unmistaken and mistaken meaning [14117]. With extremely pure, know their results and liberation places [14118]. With supremely pure, see their individual entries [14119].

The unmistaken meaning of tripitaka is the uncommon secret; the mistaken is common view, conduct, and investigation [14120-14121].

Free of conception wisdom vision: know the nature of all phenomena [14122]. With pure, see practitioners' sharp and dull faculties [14123]. With extremely pure, know faculties' liberation places [14124]. With supremely pure, know faculties' dharmic correspondences [14125].

Beyond investigation wisdom vision: see all general meaning as vipashyana [14126]. With pure, see your own meaning; with extremely pure, see both general and specific characteristics as vipashyana; with supremely pure, see meaning beyond words and letters [14127-14129].

Emaho!
