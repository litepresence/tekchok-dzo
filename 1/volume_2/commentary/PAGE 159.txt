Here it is—the direct introduction. Not a method, not a technique. Just placing self-settled awareness in its own clarity. Not pushing outward, not pulling inward, not thinking in between. Looking directly at the nature of mind itself—outer, inner, middle: all empty. Self-clarity, no foundation needed.

Dharmakaya isn't confused by your views and meditations. Your concepts don't move primordial wisdom. The intention isn't fabricated by mental elaboration. In clarity, thought has no place to stand. In vastness, nothing to lose. In equality, no distance to cover.

Great self-tone without a doer. Tone and emptiness like ocean. Clear and pure like sun and moon. Vast and pervading like sky. Stable like a mountain king. This is the nature, primordial and complete.

All beings already abide here, not experiencing separation even for a moment. But we don't know our own face. We get mixed up in samsara through conceptual elaboration. The lama's instruction points directly: whether it appears as dawning or dwelling or whatever, just recognize self-settled nature. Stop wandering.

From the Lion Perfection: the path that lions cross without—action and effort falling away. The lion of effortlessness, darkness clearing into three powers. Primordial purity like untainted snow.

Samantabhadra kept pointing: when accept-reject fall away, self-liberation appears without direction. When dullness and excitement cease, great equal meditation arises. When hope and doubt dissolve, primordial confidence remains. The six aggregates naturally present, not manufactured.

This is not something to achieve. It's what's already the case when you stop pretending you don't know.

Rest now. The resting is the recognition.
