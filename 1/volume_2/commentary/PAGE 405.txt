Dharma perfectly complete, nature Great Perfection, Secret Unexcelled Tantra essence seven—spoken at the time perfectly complete, the time of pure self-conditions. By this indicator, know that for all teacher nirmanakayas, outer, inner, and secret perfections exist as fivefold.

This is describing the conditions under which the Dharma is taught—when all factors are perfect: the teacher, the teaching, the time, the place, the audience. These aren't arbitrary; they're the spontaneous display of wisdom when conditions align.

Second, the extensive explanation of the individual abodes of wisdom—three. Essence: self-nature of self-awareness, free from elaborations. From the Thalgyur:

"From concept-free dharma-nature self-sound,
Objectless wisdom appearance arises."

Definitive terminology also from that:

"Wisdom first arising,
By knowing, afflictions' faults purified."

This is the key insight: Wisdom isn't something you acquire; it's something you recognize. It's already present as the nature of your own awareness. When you recognize it, afflictions are naturally purified—not through force, but through seeing their true nature.

Divided into three: Dharmakaya wisdom abiding in the basis; Sambhogakaya wisdom possessing its own characteristics; Nirmanakaya all-pervading wisdom.

First, essence, nature, compassion—three. Essence primordially pure wisdom: awareness empty-luminous, stainless, ultimate, dharmakaya free from elaborations' extremes, nature of twofold pure expanse, abiding as basis of arising of inseparable three kayas.

Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom: clear depth, light basis of arising, abiding—pure realms, palaces, light rays and so forth appear, fulfilling trainees' hopes.

Compassion all-pervading wisdom: at its own time, elaborations completely pacified, no conventional terminology of entering objects, yet abiding as basis of arising of all knowing wisdoms. From the state of great spontaneous expanse and wisdom, unmoving, without wavering, effortless exertion, seeds of beings' twofold benefit arise.

From the Longchenpa's Six Spaces:

"By essence primordially pure wisdom,
Separation from non-recognition's stain.
By nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom,
Separation from confusion's word-harm.
By compassion all-pervading wisdom,
All appears connected in one expanse."

This is the complete description of dharmakaya wisdom—three aspects, one nature. Primordially pure is the essence. Spontaneously accomplished is the nature. All-pervading compassion is the display.

Without the portion of dharmakaya emptiness' wisdom abiding in the basis, basis of arising or seed-like portion, Buddha, non-recognition awakened, upward cut off.

This is crucial! Without recognizing this dharmakaya wisdom that's already present, you can't progress on the path. It's the foundation, the seed, the basis of everything.

Emaho! Three wisdoms, one nature, complete!
