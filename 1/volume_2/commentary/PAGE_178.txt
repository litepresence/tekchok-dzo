"Whoever meets this, even with uninterrupted sins, liberated by familiarizing this—doubtless, narak."

[7538-7542]
Second: particular explanation of primordial liberation's dharmata has three: showing no need for effort-antidotes because primordially liberated now self-liberated; instruction not departing from dharmata's nature; resting without ever experiencing going elsewhere from basis-free self-dissolution.

[7543-7581]
From Pearl Garland: "Not liberated by effort, primordially liberated from the start."

Also: "Ignorance itself self-arisen, delusion's cause primordially Buddha. All-ground dharmakaya self-dawn, cut transmission's birth from root. Wish-fulfilling intention primordially abides, changers are self-placed. Breath primordially continuous, birth and death primordially nonexistent. Desires' objects primordially complete, grasping's extreme is meditation itself. Limbs unmoved primordially transcended, beings' path primordially traversed. Speech expressed inexpressible, primordially beyond speech and thought. Thought's dispersion primordially empty, primordially abides great meditation. Stains self-pure, abides great stainless wide-open. From no place of doing, from first free from activity-doing. From ground no arising, primordially self-arisen alone..."

Emaho! Primordially complete, nothing to do!
