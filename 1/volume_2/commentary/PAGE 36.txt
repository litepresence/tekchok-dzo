[1849-1891] Self path: gate three defilement and with-attachment aggregate and moving thought and coarse wind-mind mind pure need by. Those pure when: below ground-path incidentally complete, sign dawn. Above complete by below incidentally complete become—aim great-completion one in, purify traverse not-need speak. Ground one: rigpa spontaneously-accomplished all-do in, not-transform not-purify rigpa spontaneously-complete. Third: supreme place definite in yogin distinction generally show and vessel-possess individual explain in two from. From Rang-shar: think not-possible yogin also within five kinds gather, that also show this like—great power complete, great prophecy obtain, great breath emit, body half and command-obey action yogin. Later four yogins also within these five gather explain. From that itself: that also five yogins complete. Five yogins individually explain from Rang-shar: all three realms beings command-obey action yogin is; truth see person that, delusion appearance cease, body-mind half yogin is; spontaneously-accomplished various appearance in certainty obtain become, prophecy obtain yogin is; final of final sense-power that, ten directions emanation realm in dwell tathagata that, great breath emit yogin is; great primordially-pure unchanging in action-effort all free that, great power complete yogin is.

Emaho! Five great accomplished yogins!
