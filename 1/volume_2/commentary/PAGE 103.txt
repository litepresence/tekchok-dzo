Now we come to speech training—this is where most of you fail! First, speak less. Cut ordinary speech short in sessions, then extend. Sometimes speak alone even when no cause exists. This isn't about becoming a mute—it's about breaking the automatic pattern. You chatter like a magpie all day, then wonder why your meditation doesn't work. Cut it!

Abiding means mantra and virtuous utterance—not denying them, but not mixing even one syllable with ordinary words. At this time, body's sign makes meaning understood. Then swallowing: not uttering mantra either. Firm: not transgressing from silence. Like a mute—not making sign with anyone. Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut. Do you feel the relief?

When speech's speaking is cut, inexpressible meaning arises in mind. Not mixed with others' speech—body purified. By this purification, buddhas and dakinis bless, liberating body into illusory body. Then, object blocked, speech purified—sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes. Clairvoyance arises. This is the instruction on cutting body-mind connection.

Mind's main point: not thinking any thought while gazing at sky expanse. Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished. Body and speech bound, mind caught secondarily—dhatu-awareness dawns, elements' binding cut. Thus body, speech, and mind bound in dharmadhatu's vision—this becomes habituation.

Emaho! Stop talking and look at the sky of your own mind!
