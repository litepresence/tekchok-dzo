Ah, precious disciple! We have arrived at the conclusion of this section on signs [15201-15220]—the marks of liberation, the indications of maturation, the portents of the path. Like a skilled physician reading the pulse, the wise practitioner reads these signs.

The four lamps shine [15221-15240]—the lamp of space, the lamp of thigle, the lamp of wisdom, the lamp of water. Each illuminates a facet of your true nature. Together they dispel the darkness of ignorance, revealing the primordial mandala that has always been present.

Thodgal's four visions [15241-15260]—dharmata appearing, experiences maturing, awareness reaching full measure, exhaustion of phenomena. Like the dawn progressing to full day, recognition deepens until all is light. This is not gradual cultivation but direct manifestation!

Spontaneous liberation [15261-15280]—the hallmark of the great perfection. Not achieved through effort but recognized through relaxation. Like ice naturally melting in spring sunshine, confusion dissolves when exposed to the warmth of awareness. No need to hammer at it!

The dharmata nature [15281-15300]—empty yet luminous, beyond existence and non-existence, transcending all conceptual extremes. Like a bird flying through the sky leaving no trace, the realized mind moves through phenomena without grasping or rejecting.

Thus the path is complete [15301-15320]—ground as recognition, path as maturation, result as spontaneous presence. All three are one taste in the great expanse. Rest in this, fortunate one, and let all efforts cease!

Emaho!
