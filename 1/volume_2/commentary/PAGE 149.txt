[6357-6364] Listen here, dear practitioner! Mind, whichever of those two dawns—outward dawns, outer object; inward dawns, inner body! Fragments divided, particles portion not considered. Arisen vision-object not-existing see time, from that mind not-arisen awareness-ground grasping. Object conceptuality basis not-existing, root-free great thig-decided!

[6365-6371] Arisen maker sha-ra-ra o-la-la's mind and mind-arisen self, self-arisen instant's knowing substance two become. Self other-from not-arisen analyzed. Now arisen place self-arisen—arisen or thought color and shape? No color, no shape, not-existing color various, not-existing shape various! Thus appearing like mind, mind also dharmata free, dharmata also self-liberated!

Do you see? Mind is self-arisen! Not from outside, not from inside—just self-arisen! No color, no shape, yet appearing!

Emaho! The self-arisen nature of mind!
