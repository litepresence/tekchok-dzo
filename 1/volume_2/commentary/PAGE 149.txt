[6357-6376]
Listen! When mind's two aspects dawn—dawning outward, outer objects. Dawning inward, inner body. Divide particle by particle, analyze atomless—arising's appearing object not seen.

Then knowing mind didn't arise—grasping-object fixation, groundless, rootless great decided! Ariser sha-ra-ra, oh-la-la—mind and mind-arising, self-from-self arising—instant consciousness becomes two substances.

Other-from-self not arisen, already analyzed—so arisen that self-arisen arising? Color, shape, sign, characteristic, size, partial aspects—analyzed, nowhere abiding!

Mind-made analysis merely groundless, suddenly gone pure—inner grasping fixation groundless, space-like, self-realized! Dharmas and dharmata appearing—all grasping, objectless, supportless great!

At that time realizing—mind first unborn, primordially abiding, today realized—dharmakaya beyond elaboration, meaning understood!

Emaho! Search for mind—find nothing!
