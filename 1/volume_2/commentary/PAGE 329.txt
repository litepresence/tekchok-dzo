**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [13911-13940]

Listen well, you who wish to be free! The second topic concerns how subsequent memory arises. Previous accumulations and the lama's compassion, entering into the sublime Dharma and training—these habits appear here [13911].

Receiving empowerments, you see the river of empowerment flowing. Practicing generation stage, you remember the deity. Practicing completion stage, path, essential instructions, meditation, and view are remembered. Pure aspirations are remembered, and those with dull faculties are blessed to remember natural nirmanakaya [13912-13918].

At this stage of spontaneous accomplishment, due to previous exceptional merit, your own display appears—this is called "ground empowerment" [13919-13920].

First, all Tathagatas from the sky above bestow empowerment, and offering goddesses without number rain down flower showers, singing auspicious songs and dancing—great appearances arise [13921-13922].

At this time, for those with supreme devotion to the lama, remembering the lama, he appears in space and gives essential instructions—liberation becomes inevitable [13923-13924]. For those with faith in the yidam, seeing the deity's face, the karmic body does not appear. When the yidam's illusory body is taken, prophecies also arise [13925-13927].

Emaho!
