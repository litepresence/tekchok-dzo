The Buddha activity—body, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity—adorned by the ornament wheel's pure realm, completely perfect and greatly expanded. This is the fruition, the result of all practice. Not just personal enlightenment, but the complete manifestation of all enlightened qualities.

From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection:

"Buddha activity accomplishes the essence,
Buddha activity does what needs to be done,
Divided, shown as four aspects."

And then: Emaho!

Peaceful and expansive,
Likewise powerful and wrathful—
Peaceful gathers into dharma-nature expanse,
Expansive shows various essences,
Powerful ripens the unripened,
Wrathful cuts through everything completely.

These are the four types of enlightened activity. Don't think "activity" means doing things in the ordinary sense. This is Buddha-activity—spontaneous, natural, effortless manifestation that benefits beings according to their needs. Sometimes peaceful, sometimes expansive, sometimes powerful, sometimes wrathful. All are compassion in different forms.

[17110-17120]
This is the conclusion of the 25th chapter on spontaneous accomplishment, the final chapter. Thus, the mansion of excellent explanation, the jewel mansion, reaches the end of the dharmadhatu sky, completely arranged without exception, vast collections of inexhaustible Dharma topics, fulfilling the hopes of embodied beings, raining down like the wish-fulfilling jewel.

The glorious auspicious sun of bliss increases the feast of joy. The Teacher's Dharma rain falls in the three worlds. Those with various trainees to guide, possessing limitless followers—among them, the peak of great perfection, supreme and secret—this amazing, wondrous, authentic offering, clearly opened.

Longchenpa is describing his own work! Not with pride, but with dedication. He's offering this Treasury as a jewel mansion, a stupa of Dharma, reaching to the ends of space, benefiting all beings.

[17121-17135]
The object of the Omniscient Lord of Mind's activity is whatever spreads through the realm of beings with fortune. The stainless, dust-free, fresh red sun beautifies the mansion of my intelligence. Even very difficult to realize realms should be seen by self and others.

Whatever appears as the nature of this—the place of deep ocean waves, the lake of unprecedented wisdom, even shaking the throne of conceptual fixation—the glorious great lake Unshakable, that unmoving, without waves or disturbance, deep and vast, difficult to realize, that has today appeared before my mind.

He's describing the nature of mind itself—the ocean of wisdom, unmoving, deep, vast. And he's saying: today, it has appeared. Not "I realized it" but "it appeared"—as if the wisdom dawned on its own, through the power of the practice and dedication.

[17136-17147]
The ocean of vidyadharas, the assembly of oath-bound protectors, open the eye of delight in this. Through the profound and vast vajra realm, this stainless jewel mansion, extremely clear in nature, makes the Luminosity Heart Essence teaching remain long in the world, revealing the good path for the fortunate, causing the lotus of liberation to bloom.

From the sleep of the powerful holy elephant, concerned that the profound key points would be scattered and lost in other established philosophical systems, without delay, in the 25th chapter of Buddha's collection, gathering the heart meaning in one direction, I respectfully made it a support for the mind.

This is Longchenpa's explanation of why he wrote this text—to preserve the profound teachings from being lost, to gather the essential meaning, to make it accessible while keeping it profound.

[17148-17226]
The text continues with extensive architectural metaphors comparing this Treasury to a great stupa, a mansion, a mountain of Dharma. The unsurpassed vehicle's Mount Meru, spontaneously high, the four-sided vase completely round, the conch of profound instruction, the wheel of Dharma limitless, the sun and moon of base, path, and fruition moved by wind, the flower and bell completely raised, the white parasol's peak, the jewel pinnacle vast.

This is the completion, the sealing of the entire work. After 415 pages, 25 chapters, thousands of verses—Longchenpa has built a mansion of Dharma, a stupa of wisdom, a treasury of jewels. And he offers it to you.

[17215-17218]
Listen to this call to action: "Therefore, faithful ones desiring liberation, strive to enter this jewel treasury! Having separated from the darkness of non-recognition, luminosity manifest, in this life go to the other shore of the three realms' ocean!"

This is it! The whole point. Don't just read—enter! Don't just study—realize! Go to the other shore in this very life. This is possible. This is what Longchenpa is offering you.

The rest of the page is dedication of merit—offering the virtue of composing this immense work to all beings, wishing them to pacify the defilements of mind, to realize self-knowing luminosity like the sun and moon, to obtain the ground of spontaneously accomplished vajra peak possessing all supreme qualities, and to accomplish benefit and happiness for beings without separation of body and wisdom.

This is how you complete a Dharma text—with dedication, with offering, with the vow to benefit all beings. Take this into your heart. Don't let it be just words. Let it transform you!
