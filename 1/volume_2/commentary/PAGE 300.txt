Fortunate disciple, thus concludes this portion of the Treasury's commentary [15441-15460]—pages 251 through 300, covering the signs of the path, the four visions of thodgal, spontaneous liberation, and the nature of dharmata.

Remember [15461-15480]: these teachings are not for mere intellectual understanding. Like a recipe for food, the words are useless unless put into practice. Meditate on the thigle; recognize the four lamps; rest in dharmata's natural state. This is the only way.

The signs described [15481-15500]—relics, lights, sounds, earth-shaking—are not fantasies or exaggerations. When awareness truly recognizes itself, the elements respond. Like a magnet affecting iron filings, pure awareness naturally purifies the material body.

Do not seek these signs [15501-15520] as goals in themselves. They are byproducts of recognition, like flowers that bloom when spring arrives. Focus on the root: stable confidence in the natural state. Everything else follows naturally.

The bardo instructions [15521-15540] are your insurance policy for death. Practice them now while alive; then at death they will arise spontaneously. Like a trained dancer whose body remembers the steps, your mind will remember dharmata.

Patrul's final words [15541-15560]: Do not waste this precious human life in distraction and worldly pursuits. The signs of death approach like a mountain's shadow at sunset—inexorable and swift. Practice now, liberate now, be free!

Emaho!
