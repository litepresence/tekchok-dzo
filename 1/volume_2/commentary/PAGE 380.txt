Listen! Actually nowhere established as anything. From that itself: "In nature's appearance, no mark-grasping at all. Not color, self-clear, knowing and awareness aspects only. Without grasping's held object, no conception's grasping aspect. In light-transcending self-radiance, primordially abiding distinguished. In body-transcending self-radiance, completely pure great mudra abiding." Thus.

Emaho! Don't grasp at experiences! The clear light, the bliss, the visions—these are all marks if you grasp them. The true nature is beyond light and dark, beyond form and formless. Like space doesn't need light to be space, your nature doesn't need experiences to be complete!

Second, nature of awareness abiding in expanse has five: Elements Mama Zhayog. Dissolving into pristine awareness expanse. Wisdom elevating to sky. Coiling in luminous clarity expanse. Awareness holding own place. First: Three wombs gathered as one, five elements liberated below, unobstructed to pure pristine awareness eye. That too, when impure confusion appearance dissolves into pure suchness, flesh-blood body dissolves into luminous illusory body, then that itself dissolves into Dharmakaya jewel secret body. Wisdom eye dissolves into pristine awareness eye, that itself dissolves into suchness eye, object and knower activity completely pure. In jewel secret womb, internally clear pristine awareness intent, without transfer or change.

From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Impure confusion appearance obscures pristine awareness appearance. Confusion appearance ceases, pure appearance dawns. Latency womb obscures pristine awareness illusory body. Abandoning this body, light appearance dawns. Then reaches jewel womb's end. Three wombs gathered as one, emanation in ten directions accomplished." Thus.

Present body's five elements' dregs purified. If calculated as separately abiding in primordially pure internal expanse luminous clarity five great elements' expanse, impure elements actually become pure elements or abiding as Mama Zhayog, not so.

This is the completion of the path! The body dissolves, not into nothing, but into light. The elements transform into wisdom. Don't fear this dissolution—it's the natural completion, like ice becoming water, water becoming vapor, vapor becoming space!
