**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [14380-14405]

Listen, my fortunate ones! The first: When rigpa enters outward clear light appearance, know radiance as self-display [14352]. When light enters inward into rigpa, know not moving from that ground of original purity [14353].

Second: At the time of four wisdoms preparation, outer, inner, and secret three liberations abiding in own face, knowing own face essential instruction—grasping that [14355-14356].

Aggregates' self-grasping ceasing, body liberates as clear light, dharmata abides in own face. Elements coarse and subtle particles liberated, appearance abides as clear light great bliss. Afflictions coarse and subtle liberated, rigpa abides as mother and child dissolved [14357-14359].

Outer delusion purified, rigpa knows meeting dharmata mother, and various conditioned appearances as objects liberate from coarse and subtle things, mother and child nondual liberation [14360].

How liberated? Earth element's characteristics self-purified, body's flesh bindings liberated. Water purified, blood; fire purified, warmth; wind purified, breath bindings liberated [14361-14365]. No thought horse, flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated. Inner rigpa without affliction stains, five wisdoms self-display. Objects' stains without, phenomena and dharmata nondual [14366-14369].

Emaho!
