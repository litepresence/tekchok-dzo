[4954–4963]
Listen here, yogin! Three main points establish the base within: dharmata as inner field, gate of dawn, and wind's abiding. Through secret habituation, ripening signs, and ultimate exhaustion, you take the measure. The three kayas complete the fruit—therefore called "three," determined as four groups of three!

[4964–4971]
Or understand it this way: dharmata contains the three kayas spontaneously present. Their self-resonance dawns outward as three visions—dharmakaya's resonance as inner experience, awareness-emptiness; sambhogakaya's resonance as five lights outwardly clear, wisdom self-clear; nirmanakaya's resonance as dawn-liberation, limitless with discriminating awareness potency. Through three bases established, entities are non-different. Through three paths, obstacles cleared, no near or far in the path. Through three measures, measure delivered, no randomness or confusion. Through three fruits, delivered to exhaustion's end—no yes-no, no doubt. This is called direct perception!

[4972–4983]
In ordinary times, you see pleasure, displeasure, and equanimity—three appearances of pleasure, pain, and middle. When taking guru's instructions into experience, you directly see dhatu, awareness, and dharmas as three. Whatever appears is dharmata appearing. Whatever field it appears in is dhatu. However it appears is light, light-house, awareness, hanging-cord together. Through experiencing this vision, you buddha without seeing the fruit as stone—dharmata's self-exhaustion!

Emaho! The three that are simultaneously liberated!
