[130-133]
Continuing with the characteristics. Water's characteristic: moisture—not just wetness, but the quality of cohesion, binding things together, fluidity. Fire: warmth—not just heat, but the principle of transformation, maturation, clarity. Wind: movement—not just motion, but the principle of change, activity, dynamism. Space: openness and spaciousness—not just emptiness, but the principle of accommodation, the capacity to contain everything without obstruction.

These aren't abstract qualities. They're describing how the elements actually function in your experience and in the world. Feel them directly!

[134-145]
Fifth, the sequence of functions. Now we get the embryology—the actual development of the body in the womb. From the Thalgyur:

Earth makes the basis of the body first. By producing, it ripens as flesh. Water gathers the entire body; by producing, it ripens as blood. Fire ripens the entire body; by producing, it ripens as warmth. Wind lifts the entire body; by producing, it makes breath ripen.

This is the order: earth establishes the foundation (flesh), water brings cohesion (blood), fire brings maturation (warmth), wind brings movement and vitality (breath). This isn't just physical development—it's the pattern of how manifestation occurs. Foundation first, then cohesion, then maturation, then dynamism. See this pattern everywhere!

[146-155]
Sixth, dharma-nature. Though the elements are generally empty—yes, they're empty of inherent existence—here Longchenpa focuses on how they hold their own characteristic, their particular dharma-nature. From the Self-Arisen:

The cause of arising is earth—everything manifests from the ground, the basis. The wisdom of arising is fire—wisdom is the clarity, the knowing quality. The emanation of arising is wind—emanation is movement, activity, manifestation. The master of arising is water—water is the cohesive principle that holds everything together. The dharma-nature of arising is space—space is the fundamental nature, the openness in which everything arises.

Each element has a special role in the process of arising. This isn't just poetic—it's describing the mechanics of manifestation from the basis!

[156-166]
Seventh, application of meaning—this is where Dzogchen really shows its profundity. From That Very (a tantra):

Within dharmakaya, primordially pure, by essence without change, arising earth also is. This is the key insight: the element earth isn't separate from dharmakaya. Its very unchanging essence IS the earth element. 

By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising fire also is. The engagement of awareness-wisdom with objects—that's fire.

By awareness-wisdom gone without movement into dimension, arising wind also is. When awareness rests without moving into the expanse, that's wind.

By awareness-wisdom gathering the three cavities as one, arising water also is. When the three centers (channels) are gathered, unified, that's water.

By wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous, arising space is. The dissolution into the inseparability of emptiness and clarity—that's space.

Longchenpa is showing you: the five elements are not separate from the five wisdoms. They're the display of the five wisdoms in form. This is the completion stage view!

[167-172]
Now the second part of applied meaning—connecting the outer five elements with inner awareness. From the Norbu Drathakod (Display of Jewels tantra):

The five outer arising are the common dharma of self-continuum. All outer-appearing elements, by connecting with self-awareness itself, are the common dharma. 

This means: everything you see outside—mountains, rivers, sky—is actually appearing to your own awareness. It's not separate from your awareness. The divisions are thus: the characteristic of earth making solidity also... [continues]

Here's the pointing-out instruction hidden in this scholastic presentation: don't look at the world as separate from your mind. The solidity of earth appears in your awareness. The fluidity of water appears in your awareness. They're not "out there" separate from you—they're the display of your own rigpa!
