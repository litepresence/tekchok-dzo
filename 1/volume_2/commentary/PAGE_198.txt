Know path dharmas all as five bodies five wisdoms. Know result dharmas all as three bodies irreversible. Know essence dharmas all as empty. Know nature dharmas all as clear. Know compassion dharmas all pervading beings. Know wisdom dharmas all unmixed. Know light dharmas all non-grasping. Know ray dharmas all without dispersion-gathering. Know rigpa dharmas all free from self-thought. Thus all dharmas as neither thought nor examined—turn!"
