Listen, fortunate child! Light's nature is five-colored self-clarity [11619-11621]—arising from pure elements meeting practiced awareness's self-radiance. It manifests as three types: upward-reaching, radiating spokes, and surrounding aureole.

Or [11625-11635]: like a ladder reaching to the sky, or like a dome of light appearing in space's center. The result: if aureole appears, liberation in first bardo; if reaching upward, dissolution into ka-dag without bardo; if radiating spokes, enlightenment in final bardo's time.

The Vajrasattva Mirror teaches [11636-11641]: "Light appearing like a house—five days to stability, manifest buddhahood. Light like a ladder—seven days to manifest buddhahood." The duration indicates the depth of recognition.

The Blazing Relics states [11642-11655]: "Light has three aspects—surrounding aureole with circumference from whose trail it arises: this achieves certainty in first bardo. If reaching upward, without bardo, instantly Buddha. If radiating from spokes, in final bardo finds manifest enlightenment."

When lhundrub appears [11656-11667], emanations spread to benefit beings everywhere. This is the great play—recognizing your own nature, then naturally benefiting others without effort, like a lamp that illuminates simply by being lit.

Emaho!
