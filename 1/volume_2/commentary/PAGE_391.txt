Listen! In primordially pure time, here, truly, non-existent, existing as seed-element mode. From Six Expanses too: "Essence, nature, and compassion's appearances appear to intelligent ones. Essence nowhere established, nature appears as clear appearance aspect. From compassion aspect, two pristine awarenesses arise without actor and action. Arising-appearance for two intellect levels, thus such pristine awareness activity appears free from effort and accomplishment. Buddhas' pristine awareness appears thus from the ground." Thus it is said.

Emaho! This is the key to understanding how enlightenment appears! Essence—empty, unestablished. Nature—clear, luminous. Compassion—unobstructed, appearing. These three aren't separate things—they're inseparable aspects of your own rigpa. The "two pristine awarenesses" appear according to the capacity of the perceiver. To deluded mind, they appear as samsara. To pure mind, as nirvana. Same display, different recognition!

Thus, expanse and pristine awareness non-dual Dharmakaya ultimate is called "great primordially pure liberation place of non-dual primordially pure spontaneously accomplished." Though abiding as nature's ground-appearance, essence nowhere established, ultimate truth sole completely perfect, great perfection, transcending body and pristine awareness, sky-like suchness is ultimate result, great internal expanse, unsurpassed liberation place, body-speech-mind non-dual vajra secret spontaneously accomplished jewel womb. From Samantabhadra Mind Mirror: "Tathagatas don't have arising and abiding in body. Why? Tathagatas lack body as substantial thing. Tathagatas' speech doesn't have transformable and untransformable. Why? Tathagatas' speech is empty. Tathagatas' mind doesn't have thinking and not-thinking. Why? Tathagatas' mind is free from conceptions." Thus. And from Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra Diamond Cutter too: "Those who see me in form, who know me in sound, entered into wrong rejection—those people don't see me. Guides are Dharmakaya. Suchness is not knowable. That cannot be known." Thus spoken.

This is radical! The Buddha has no body, no speech, no mind in the conventional sense. Don't misunderstand—this doesn't mean nothing exists. It means nothing exists as a solid, graspable, permanent "thing." The Dharmakaya is not an object of knowledge—it's the knowing itself!

Prasangika-Madhyamikas hold actual Buddha as that pure empty Dharmakaya...

Longchenpa is engaging with philosophical positions here. He's showing that even the highest common vehicle view—Dharmakaya as emptiness—is a stepping stone to the Dzogchen view. Don't cling even to emptiness! The empty nature is not a void—it's the luminous clarity that knows itself. This is the view that cuts through all extremes while naturally expressing great compassion!
