Listen! There is a great charnel ground called Blazing Ye Mountain. It has a measureless palace like this: A skull house four stories high. It is thus: Dry skulls as fruit, flesh and blood as walls, intestines with veins as roof. Measures and height immeasurable. Thunderbolt nails. Rakta as gutter water. Sun and moon as seats. Crocodile mouth as door frame. Eight great gods as pillars. Great supreme foundation. Daytime, wind swirls. Nighttime, fire blazes. Four corners of that palace, great field's canopy spread. Five goddesses dancing. All ground, rakta's waves swirling.

Inside that palace, Bhagavan Youthful Hero Powerful, mind unmoving from peace, yet body shown in wrathful aspect. Surrounded by dakinis and immeasurable wrathful gatherings. Thus: Dakini Purna Nyebar Zhiba, Brahma Dung Ngri Can, Rishi Moonlight Youth, and surrounding dakinis Ekajati six sisters, fourteen servant women, fifty-eight assistant women, and assistants hundred-thousand ten-thousand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable dakini retinue.

From Bhagavan's mind emanated retinue, Vajra Holder in hand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable wrathful retinue. Garab Dorje, etc., surrounded by immeasurable human retinue. Turning result Secret Mantra unsurpassed Dharma wheel to retinue, peaceful emanation body bodhisattvas liberated. All have wrathful frowning faces.

That palace is extremely vast. Those faculties' end persons...

Emaho! Don't be shocked by these terrifying images! This is describing the fierce aspect of wisdom—the energy that cuts through delusion. The charnel ground isn't a place—it's the recognition that all appearances are impermanent, all concepts dead. The wrathful deities aren't enemies—they're your own awareness in its most powerful form!
