Listen, you who seek liberation! Equality wisdom has four equalities: equal cause, equal condition, equal time, and equal nature [13785-13788]. The equal cause is all phenomena of samsara and nirvana. The equal condition is familiarity with dharmata. The equal time is when realization becomes manifest. The equal nature is your own awareness [13789-13792].

When you rest in this equality, it is called "equality" because dharmata cannot be corrected by anything, cannot be labeled with concepts or words [13793-13794].

Wisdom means recognizing what has always been equal, and the characteristics becoming certain at this very moment.

Then appears a red cloth, clear and distinct, with thigles of five lights radiating—this is discriminating wisdom [13798-13801]. Discriminating means the twenty-one sense faculties, which reduce to nine, then to three (sharp, medium, dull), and ultimately to two: rigpa self-display and conceptual mind [13802-13806].

With direct perception and subsequent attainment, you recognize what has always existed, the characteristics becoming certain [13809-13810].

All-accomplishing wisdom comes from the seed aspect where power is not complete, so it is established in original purity [13811-13812].

Emaho!
