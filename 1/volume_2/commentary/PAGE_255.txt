Listen, fortunate one! When you possess these nirmanakaya signs and desire to benefit beings, you take miraculous birth in the nirmanakaya realms [11026-11041]—dwelling sixty-eight thousand years for others' benefit, then manifesting in countless world-systems, all while absorbed in ka-dag.

You may wonder [11042-11056] about the five hundred years of self-benefit—there is no contradiction! For self-benefit one may dwell five hundred years; for others' benefit, countless aeons. Both are possible without conflict. Like a tree that grows for centuries yet gives shade immediately, time is not an obstacle for the realized.

Like water dissolving into water, like butter into butter, like space into space [11047-11056]—so your own nature dissolves into itself without any grasping at essence. This is not annihilation; it is spontaneous liberation! The waves return to the ocean; the rays return to the sun.

The inner awareness signs [11057-11074] are: bliss, non-attachment to worldly concerns, all appearances shining as light, seeing kayas in light without cessation, body at ease without grasping, mind one-pointed, awareness naturally relaxed, unfabricated meditation arising in your being.

This is your inheritance, fortunate child! Not something to be achieved from outside, but your own nature recognizing itself. Like a prince who discovers he has been wearing the crown all along, the realization dawns that you were never separate from the three kayas.

Emaho!
