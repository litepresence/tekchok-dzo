[1072-1080] When seeing the eight gates of spontaneously accomplished intermediate state completed, liberated by knowing one's own face—in that impure samsara gate, oneself radiating light rays from the secret space of sambhogakaya father-mother union, entering individually into pure wombs at each station, appearing to be born—through teaching Dharma, showing liberation. This is like opening emanations in a dream, summarized merely as self-appearance. When channels and elements are nearly pure, in this life too the six realms appear inside the thigle, bound by three inner crucial points, reaching exhaustion ground—not depending on distributing emanations. This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, that is the power of realization.

[1081-1100] Second, the emanation-kaya of performing actions: to those abiding on the grounds, sambhogakaya; to the impure, supreme emanation-kaya; to the very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to stations, performing benefit. From Self-Arising: showing to each whatever tames them, appearing suitable to others—not deluded regarding others' benefit, able to transform into anything. Afflictions naturally nonexistent, latencies appearing like body. To beings arrived at the time, showing great correct benefit. To whatever beings are tamed, appearing suitable to that.

[1101-1107] That emanation-kaya performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges: teaching Dharma in each being's own language; knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought; great vehicle, small, various, secret mantra generation and completion.

Emaho! Emanation-kaya's skillful means!
