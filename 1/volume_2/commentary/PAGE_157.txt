Virtue and vice, good and bad—they all dissolve suddenly. Their essence has no basis. They're self-liberated the moment they arise. Awareness has a primordial tone—if you try to grab it, you've already missed. The dharmata has no direction to point, no place to find.

All appearance, existence, samsara, nirvana—they're all the same great display: clear appearance of non-existence. Appearing without solidity. Like elements in sky, like dreams in sleep—not moving from awareness's nature. Everything self-appears in awareness, but awareness doesn't see samsara as something separate. Doesn't see nirvana as achieved. Both are just designations on something that was never divided.

Great liberation comes from not being caught in exists or not-exists. You can call it anything. Liberation isn't contradicted by any word. But words don't capture it.

Samantabhadra said: to unstained mind, appearance is not dependent on objects. That's what I showed—that's the great self-pure intention. Not cleaning up your mind, but recognizing the mind that was never stained.

From another text: entity of complete non-existence, not falling into any direction. Whatever deludes you is just appearance appearing harmoniously, yet that appearance isn't real. Like ornaments in dharmadhatu—beautiful, but not solid.

Great emptiness wisdom deludes from complete non-existence. Here's the paradox: not seeing emptiness as nihilism, not seeing it as something. Both sides cut.

The Pearl Garland puts it simply: that is me, that is beings. Mind arises from mind. Not many, just one. Samsara-nirvana is myself. Mandalas are just paths for those who need steps. Dharmas appear as dharmas. Abiding, moving, sitting, sleeping, living, dying—all arise from that. Earth, water, fire, wind, space—all from that.

From that—the vast awareness that can't be pointed to. Everything appears, nothing sticks.

Rest in that. The rest is effortless.
