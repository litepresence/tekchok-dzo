Listen, child of the lineage! These fifty pages [15321-15340] have covered the vast ocean of Dzogchen teachings—thodgal visions, spontaneous liberation, dharmata nature—all pointing to your own mind. Like a finger pointing at the moon, the words are not the truth but guide you to it.

The thigle in your heart [15341-15360]—have you recognized it? Not the visualized thigle of generation stage, but the natural thigle of awareness itself, round and luminous, free from all limitation. This is the seed of buddhahood already present.

When the four visions dawn [15361-15380], do not grasp at them as accomplishments. Like rainbows in the sky, they are beautiful but insubstantial—appearances of your own rigpa, not external deities to worship. Recognition is liberation; fixation is bondage.

Spontaneous liberation [15381-15400] means just this: whatever arises in mind, let it be. Do not follow it; do not block it. Like a guest in a hotel, let thoughts come and go without building them a permanent residence. This is the yoga of non-meditation.

Dharmata nature [15401-15420]—your inheritance from the beginning. Not received from a guru, not achieved through practice, not found in scriptures. Like a mute tasting sweetness, you know it directly without words.

Thus Patrul has spoken [15421-15440], not adding anything new, not creating anything artificial—merely pointing out what has always been your own face. Look, fortunate one, and recognize!

Emaho!
