[552-553] Now listen close—you want the heart of this in brief? Here it is. Longchenpa's pointing at what you already are, right now, reading these words. That awareness jewel of yours, it's not some treasure you dig up from the ground. It's primordially pure essence abiding in the secret cavity, in the palace of luminous self-nature. Don't go hunting for a palace somewhere else! This body of yours, this very mind—that's the palace. Essence, nature, compassion—these three aren't separate things you stack up like blocks. They're the master itself, inseparable, abiding as one. You looking for three different experiences? You'll miss the one that's staring you in the face!

[554-557] Look here—when essence abides as kaya, its own purpose isn't some object you can point at. It's not clear like "this is it." Yet it's self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from a base that never stops, never ceases. Your nature is the base where five lights arise, where life wind moves, where four branches dance. This isn't theory, friend—this is what's happening in your chest right now, primordially abiding as the essence of speech. And compassion? It's self-arisen awareness essence, spontaneously complete. Not "becoming" complete—already complete! The wisdom of two-knowing—this is what you are, abiding without shift or change, without kaya and wisdom ever separating or gathering. Stop trying to unite what was never apart!

[558-560] What are these two knowings? Listen: depending on the inner-clear essence of dharmata—everything known. Depending on the outer-clear aspect of what's appearing—all aspects known. It's like this: you know what's inside the room, you know what's outside. But it's not two different knowers! One awareness, two ways of shining. Don't make this complicated.

[561-562] Five winds—now pay attention to your breath. Root life wind, the portion of compassion awareness wisdom—if pure, it's Buddha wisdom. If impure, it's the base of sentient beings' confused aggregates. Same wind, different recognition. The difference between buddha and sentient being isn't in the wind itself—it's in whether you recognize what it is!

[563-567] From that root, four branch winds emanate like rays from the sun—that's compassion's potency displaying. Upward-going wisdom horse, downward-clearing wisdom ray, fire-equal ripening power, all-pervading completing power. These four aren't somewhere else—they exist only in the portion of life wind itself. In the dimension of dharmadhatu, they don't emanate out. They abide only as essence, non-ceasing base of display, essence branch clear as light. See? Not going anywhere, not coming from anywhere.

[572-582] Kunsel says it like this—kaya abides like the form-reflection of an empty-luminous bubble. Speech abides like fire spark rays in the expanse of awareness. Mind's clear nature is life wind itself, like wisdom fire sparks without falling in any direction, abiding as five wisdoms. And all of this—wisdom that no concept can deceive. Not your thinking mind, friend. Wisdom itself, beyond the reach of your clever ideas!

[583] Emaho! What a wonder!
