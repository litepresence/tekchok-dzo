Cut through everything. That's the only tool you need.

When you finally stop trying to find mind, ease arises. Not the ease of getting what you want—the ease of nothing to get. No returning place, no support, no house to maintain. The house of mind ceasing isn't destruction. It's just rest. The child builds houses in sand and knocks them down. No loss. No tragedy.

Here's the radical teaching: Buddha doesn't exist. Not even as a concept. Not even as a name. You're not becoming Buddha—you're recognizing that the whole project was based on a misunderstanding. The hope for results, the effort on the path, the striving to achieve liberation—all of that is what's being cut.

Samsara and nirvana are just names. Labels you slap on experience. The liberation measure is not finding meaning in those labels. They're empty sounds. Pointing at nothing. You thought you needed to escape samsara to reach nirvana? You're pointing at the same thing with different words.

Mind itself is non-existent. Having nothing, being nothing. No cause to find, no reason to seek. The four aspects of non-existence, the sixteen dharma-dwellers—this is not a new system to learn. It's describing the cessation of all systems. Destroying mind's house means there was never a house. Just appearances before-after, arising and dissolving.

Iron destroys iron. Impermanent destroys impermanent. Wisdom destroys ignorance. But who is destroying what? No one doing it. Like writing on water—no trace left. Looking for mind in mind is like looking for treasure in a poor man's house—it was never there to find.

The dissolve has no place to hold. That's why it's called liberation—not because you achieve something, but because there's nothing left to lose.

Stop searching. The search is the trap. The ease is on the other side of stopping.

Rest now. The rest has no further instructions.
