Look! Do you see? The visions appear—like wisdom palace shape, like sun and moon connected, like stacked lotuses, like stacked stupas, like thousand-petaled lotus. These forms transcend the binding of five elements! They're not ordinary appearances.

What are they called? "Experience of one-arising one-ceasing"—they come and go as one. And that? Called "increase above"—each one different from before, higher and clearer. Thus: awareness causes arising, arising from previously relying on empowerment sequence. The empowerment opens the door; these visions show you've walked through.

Now the particular explanation of vision manner—two types: five wisdoms' color vision, and shape vision. First:

Vajra family fully purified: mirror-like wisdom self-light dawns white color form; that same vajra unmovable resonance pierces white and dawns. Below that: Tathagata family fully purified: dhatu wisdom dawns blue color form; display resonance dawns blue-black.

Jewel family fully purified: equality wisdom's yellow cloth, and very piercing Jewel Source resonance, like refined gold, dawns. Lotus family fully purified: discriminate wisdom color red cloth, and very red Infinite resonance, like coral color, dawns. Karma family fully purified: action-accomplish wisdom dawns green color cloth; very green Actual Accomplish resonance, like indranila form, dawns.

Those outer sequence, blue vajra fence surrounding all: showing wisdom without difference. From that vision increase: five five clear, each chief color five light.

Emaho! Five families, five colors, five wisdoms—they're all appearing right now in your own heart! Don't look elsewhere!
