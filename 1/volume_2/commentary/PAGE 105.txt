[4673-4688]
Differentiated by lineage scripture: from Self-Arising Awareness Tantra—body, etc., by fully pressing all main points, awareness itself and directly, from guru's instruction, know. Rely upon actual main, self-mind. Body main point and speech and also, relying upon mind main point, making wind somehow slow, arising from fully projecting, body and mind connection cut. Not reversing even in three realms!

[4689-4701]
Gate: look with three-bodies' eye. Field: separate from obscuration-doer. Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness. From Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: by dharmakaya gaze manner, press and extract three-realms' samsara. Sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground. Nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field.

[4702-4719]
From Letterless: gaze eye at sky element. From Secret Sound Tantra: lower, reverse, corner—three gaze manner types famous. Nirmanakaya: lower, buddha looking at disciples. Sambhogakaya: corner look, buddha looking at field-realm. Dharmakaya: reverse, buddha looking at base. Bad eye faculty? Harmonize with nirmanakaya, eye not dim. Eye fault? Harmonize with sambhogakaya, eye clears. Good eye faculty? Harmonize with dharmakaya, swift vision arrives. Within three eyes, realize. Dharmakaya: dharmata eye existing in speech.

Emaho! Three gazes for three capacities—find yours!
