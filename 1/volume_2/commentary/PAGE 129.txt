[5540-5564]
This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection, and that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through copper-shining, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings." Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the copper-shining—like the great master Vimala and Padma.

Then, having obtained control over birth and entry, although buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay, yet doing the benefit of beings until samsara is not empty, possessing self-power. Control over birth: at the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously, even insects cease into light. Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.

Control over entry: although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound, through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings, making rain of food and clothes. Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse, if not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse; if doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free, doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields. Through earth treasures, jewels, dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means, for compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.

Emaho! Great transfer body—benefit beings endlessly, compassion without limit!
