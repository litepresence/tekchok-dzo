Listen! With jewel horse-drops. All ground made of crystal jewel. Extremely pleasant. Beautiful to see. With stairs and windows. Four directions have four great windows. Sun rises from windows, shines on crystal-made ground, inside daytime five lights' appearance spontaneously dawns. Outside that measureless palace, water moat with eight qualities.

Outside that, seven jewel iron mountains. In their center, throne made of seven jewels, with Dharma teaching seat. There emanation body Vajrasattva, dawn teaches cause Dharma to retinue. Noon teaches mantra Dharma. Morning teaches internal Dharma. Sun noon teaches Great Perfection unsurpassed result Dharma. Thus daily, four Dharma sessions arise. Those abiding bodhisattvas bound by one birth, merely so.

Emaho! "Four Dharma sessions" means awareness is always teaching—through every perception! The "seven jewel mountains" are the seven aspects of enlightenment. The "eight ponds" are the eight liberations. The "birds" are the natural sounds of wisdom. This is your own mind when recognized—every moment is Dharma, every appearance is instruction!
