Listen, child of the lineage! Preta-realm signs [11914-11928]: at death, unclear sky with fading light like western sunset, dead sun and moon, yellow clouds covering them, rain falling with subsequent cold, evening rain. These indicate external, internal, sudden, distinctive, inverted, karmic, and enjoyment-obscured preta realms.

Animal-realm signs [11929-11935]: at death-transfer, dark and hazy sky without warmth, covered by dark clouds, valley blue with smoke appearance, hazy unpleasant sky. This leads to animals with many legs, no legs, four legs, winged, scaled—countless varieties.

Asura-realm signs [11936-11950]: fierce wind rising from all directions, terrifying dark red cloud-forms appearing, clouds swirling violently with thunder roaring and lightning flashing, sun and moon obscured. Five asura types: five-cornered, six-faced, long-armed, big-bellied, sky-going with matted hair.

God-realm signs [11951-11963]: at breath-separation, clear pure sky with bright sun and moon, no wind or dust, directions beautiful and joyful. This leads to six desire-god families, five pure abode gods, fifteen clear light birth-places, four limitless perception entrances.

Human-realm signs [11964-11984]: clear sky without dust, gentle white clouds stretching like silk, sun and moon with rainbow light surrounding—indicating precious human birth in the three higher realms.

Emaho!
