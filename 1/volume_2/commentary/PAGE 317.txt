From there radiate pure rays, threads, direct and horizontal, like sunlight spreading from the rising sun's wheel! These are not external lights—you are seeing your own nature displaying itself to itself! Like a mirror seeing its own face, like a lamp illuminating itself.

Emaho! The light of your own mind—brighter than a thousand suns!
