[4637-4645]
Body, speech, and mind's main points—know them, rely on them, liberate from samsara! Three main points relying, direct self-point delivery: bind three main points in vajra seal, introduce awareness's own face directly, show vision's dawning manner from that. First two: show general seal of three main points, deliver particular self's main point.

[4646-4661]
Gate, field, and wind-awareness—these three. Do not separate from instruction. Gate and field themselves, wind and awareness main point itself—seal them all. Like a weapon hitting a vital point—when channels or heart's meaning is struck, whatever is done, feeling dies. Three main points: dharmata has no ground for change. Gate is cause to see; field is cause not to change; wind-awareness delivers to sign-measure.

[4662-4672]
Gate like threshold, field like escort, wind-awareness like bandit. Arrow hits, person cannot change—captured. Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand. Impossible not to hit dharmata's direct main point. Field not existing, no basis ground; gate not existing, beings' path lost; wind-awareness not existing, knowing-awareness doesn't penetrate—therefore three main points determined. More than that: limitless, you lose the main point. Fewer: meaning not accomplished.

Emaho! Three keys to unlock what was never locked!
