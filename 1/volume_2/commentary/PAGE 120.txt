Look here, devoted one! The awareness eye draws forth vision [5208], and from that, canopy tents and houses appear as preliminary purity [5209]. These too differ by diligence - three days, seven days, fourteen days of arising and ceasing as one [5210-5212]. Beyond that, experience increases vision even further [5213].

Listen! During this preliminary time [5214], conceptuality's difference raises and ceases as signs [5215]. Then the vision of awareness's self-essence dawns [5216]! Light points dawn like hanging cords gathering as one [5217], then two points connect - method and discriminating-awareness fully purify [5218], then five points connect as the five wisdoms enter [5219]. Direct connection of points - not different, merely small existence [5220] - experience increases beyond this [5221].

The Thalgyur declares: "The five-colored light, victory-banner and boat-part vision, seeing the field boat-only measure" [5223-5225]. The Self-Arising Tantra proclaims: "Seeing one's own face thus, upper joint four fingers apart, separate person of good capacity - how could they enter samsara?" [5227-5231].

Dear practitioner, whatever boat-part forms dawn accomplish emanation qualities [5232-5233]. Whatever fields dawn are the same heaps [5234-5235]. When outer visions cease, sixteen moments [5236-5238] - thus it is said.

Third, the awareness measure-arrive vision shows general manner [5240]. From explaining nature particularly [5241], first: points each dawn in half the body, purifying nirmanakaya [5243], then the body itself dawns each, directly seeing dharmata [5244], then body becomes five-by-five fathers and mothers as sambhogakaya wisdom measure-arrives [5245], then individual heaps with mandala vision [5246].

Thus, dear one, these are your own face - do not seek elsewhere! Emaho!
