[1072-1080] Listen carefully, dear one! When seeing the eight gates of the spontaneously accomplished intermediate state completed, liberated by knowing one's own face—in that impure samsara gate, oneself radiating light rays from the secret space of sambhogakaya father-mother union, entering individually into pure wombs at each station, appearing to be born—through teaching Dharma, showing liberation.

This is like opening emanations in a dream, summarized merely as self-appearance. When channels and elements are nearly pure, in this life too the six realms appear inside the thigle, bound by three inner crucial points, reaching exhaustion ground—not depending on distributing emanations. This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, that is the power of realization.

[1081-1100] Second, the emanation-kaya of performing actions: to those abiding on the grounds, sambhogakaya appears; to the impure, supreme emanation-kaya appears; to the very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to their stations, performing benefit. From the Self-Arising Tantra: showing to each whatever tames them, appearing suitable to others—not deluded regarding others' benefit, able to transform into anything.

Afflictions are naturally nonexistent, yet latencies appear like a body. To beings arrived at the right time, showing great correct benefit. To whatever beings are to be tamed, appearing suitable to that very being.

[1101-1107] That emanation-kaya performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges: teaching Dharma in each being's own language; knowing faculties and latencies, showing what is suitable to that thought; great vehicle, small vehicle, various vehicles, secret mantra generation and completion stages.

Emaho! Emanation-kaya's skillful means are limitless! Like a master illusionist, the Buddha appears in whatever form benefits each being!
