Listen, friend! The Clear-Meaning says: all gathered in mind, inner self unmoving, abiding yet eye sees form—this mind is sense-born. But this is worldly direct perception, not the transcendent kind!

The direct perception meeting ultimate dharmata is awareness' essence existing in the heart. Like the sun and its rays—cause and effect certain—you meet this through faith in reasoning, not through ordinary senses. This transcends both worldling and transcendental realms. While worldly direct perception focuses on mind knowing objects, this is awareness direct perception—seeing the main point sealed within!

[4932–4941]
Now, four ways dharmata is named. Listen carefully! Samsara's dharmas versus nirvana's dharmata—this is dharmata. Appearances as dharmas versus emptiness as dharmata—this is dharmata. What lacks main point not liberating versus what exists certainly liberating—famous as dharmata. Dhatu as dharmas versus awareness as dharmata, both non-dual—this is it!

[4942–4953]
Direct perception is actually seen in sense-power's field without relying on intellect. However much you seek with intellectual wisdom, the time of finding never comes! The seeker lacks eyes—luminous clarity possesses no form. As the Collection says: "Wisdom investigates but finds not the bottom of aggregates." This luminous vision is not the form famous in terms—it cannot be destroyed by the four elements' harm. Form can be crushed, but this is not form!

Emaho! Direct perception beyond the senses!
