Attend to the final summary! [12481-12505] The essence of thod rgal is this: rest in the nature of your own mind and let the displays arise naturally. Do not try to create them, do not try to stop them. Simply recognize them as your own face.

[12506-12530] The five lamps are the supports for this practice, but the real lamp is the lamp of wisdom in your own heart. External conditions are merely helpers—the true practice is internal.

[12531-12555] Whether you practice for three years or seven, whether the signs arise quickly or slowly, do not be attached to progress. The path itself is the result. Every moment of recognition is complete in itself.

[12556-12580] When obstacles arise, recognize them as displays. When good experiences arise, recognize them as displays. When nothing arises, recognize that as the display of emptiness. In all cases, the recognition is what matters.

[12581-12605] The great masters of the past achieved liberation through this practice. You have the same nature as them, the same potential. What they achieved, you can achieve. Have confidence in this!

[12606-12630] Yet do not think 'I will become a great siddha!' This too is delusion. Simply practice with sincerity, and let the result take care of itself. The fruit of the practice is not for you—it is for the benefit of all beings.

[12631-12655] When you achieve stability in this practice, you can help others. Your mere presence becomes a blessing. Your words become dharma. Your actions become benefit for beings. This is the true result.

Emaho!
