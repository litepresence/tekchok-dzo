Listen well, fortunate ones!

Wisdom dissolving into wisdom is like a child entering the mother's lap [14260].

Light dissolving into light is like a rainbow melting in space [14261].

Form dissolving into form is like a vase [14262].

Non-duality dissolving into non-duality is like a river dissolving into a river [14263].

Freedom from extremes dissolving into freedom from extremes is like space dissolving into space [14264].

Pure wisdom gate dissolving into essence original purity is like a lion taking a snow mountain [14265].

Impure samsara gate dissolving into pure wisdom gate is like drawing in a silken cord [14266].

The fifth, extensive explanation of essential instructions that liberate into those, has two: hitting the crucial point with dharmata meaning essential instruction, and focusing with three times essential instruction [14267-14269].

The first: Methods shown for hitting the crucial point in both this life and bardo [14270-14272].

From essence, nature, and compassion three crucial points:

Essence's crucial point: Recognize your own face directly, decide directly that it is so, and be confident directly of liberation—three [14275-14277].

First: Though nature appears as various lights, essence is rigpa radiance not beyond one, the empty-luminous original purity ground—decide this is your own face, the final liberation place, directly introduced as true seeing [14278-14280].

Second: In that nature, without fabrication, naturally in meditation, cut through completely, without distraction, without grasping—this is meditation [14281-14282].

Third: At that time, free of meditation object and subject, rigpa pure from ground shines and liberates, without abandoning good-bad thought collections, self-liberated—confidence and repetition [14283-14285].

Emaho!
