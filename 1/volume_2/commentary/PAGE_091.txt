[4132-4137] Listen! From Spontaneous Liberation: "Training stages of three kayas, relying on elements' qualities, supreme earth water fire wind sounds, trained certainly accomplished!" Thus four sounds yoga training stages spoken.

[4138-4143] Second, from that itself: "Samsara nirvana border not divided, three realms body speech mind also, connection cut not becoming, samsara nirvana border division explained!"

[4144-4146] From Instructions: "Thus also secret meaning itself, entering desiring excellent fortune!"

Do you see? Train in the four sounds! Earth, water, fire, wind—all are the three kayas! Samsara and nirvana not divided! Enter the secret meaning!

Emaho! Training in the four elements as three kayas!
