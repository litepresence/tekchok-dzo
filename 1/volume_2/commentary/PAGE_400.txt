In the expanse of light and color: mandala, retinue, individual clusters, kaya, wisdom, father, mother, body color, hand emblems, and so forth, clear. From the Secret Seed Tantra:

"On essence's appearance,
Essence kaya arises.
Like self and reflection,
Three kayas luminosity emptiness.
Not permanent, not entity,
Not severed, luminosity kaya,
Not different, without outer/inner."

This describes the nature of sambhogakaya—appearing as forms, colors, mandalas, deities, yet empty, not permanent, not different from the nature of mind itself. Like a reflection in a mirror—clearly appearing, yet without inherent existence.

[16583-16596]
Fourth: sambhogakaya taming trainees, appearing individually as families and mandalas. Emanations divided, for trainees' power: sambhogakaya dharmakaya Vairochana Great Ocean. His manner of abiding: viewed from outside, inner clear; viewed from inside, outer clear; completely transparent, without front/back; from wherever viewed, appears showing face like that, face directions all pervading.

His pure realm: completely arranged ornament, holding sway over twenty-five world systems from lotus on palm.

Place: completely pure, thick arrangement.
Retinue: not different from himself.
Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearance.
Time: realization manifestly arisen.

This is the description of Vairochana's pure realm—not a physical place, but a dimension of pure appearance, completely clear, without inside or outside, pervading all directions.

[16597-16613]
This self-appearance, though emanation from the perspective of looking at the primordial, is posited as sambhogakaya from the perspective of trainees looking at luminosity, perfect marks and signs.

Sambhogakaya's sambhogakaya: appearing as five family Buddhas' chiefs.

That itself's characteristic: essence different, nature one; measureless family mandalas of individual pure realms; place great Akanistha, five families of individual retinues; teaching engaging in five wisdoms of knowing; time: appearance taming expanding.

Sambhogakaya's nirmanakaya: five families' Buddhas and individual chief retinues.

That characteristic: appearance without nature, clear without conceptuality.

That pure realm: pure appearance enjoying devas and devis, inconceivable.

Place: Tushita, basis of wisdom arrangement.
Retinue: measureless Buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Time: time of awareness self-appearance.

That also: not yaksha abiding Tushita.

This clarifies the distinction—sambhogakaya appears in Akanistha, not the ordinary Tushita heaven. This is the pure dimension of wisdom, not the worldly god realm.

Emaho! Pure realms of wisdom light!
