Listen! How guidance and pointing-out relate: guidance shows three statements, pointing-out single statement. Three aspects of guidance tradition: outer view guidance—view of dharmas empty from beginning, nature present three lower realms. Middle view guidance—dharmata three natures; path being result path in Tathagata's own realm. Inner view guidance—ground-chained essentiality spontaneously present.

Three aspects of pointing-out tradition: outer seeing-accomplishment guidance—buddhas and bodhisattvas' vows; perceivers and learned ones see three realms empty from beginning. Middle hearing-accomplishment guidance—treasure teachings are Vairotsana's oral instruction, learned one hears and accomplishes. Inner wearing-accomplishment guidance—yogis' accomplishment of realization path.

Emaho! Guidance shows, pointing-out pierces!
