Listen! Self and grasping's fixation-object—from the very beginning in dharmata, all this self-appears by itself. Primordially appearing, previously unknown.

Self-concept bound afflictions five—primordially awareness self-arises. Co-abiding, faces not meeting! Earth water fire wind four elements—primordially your own body. Who hasn't seen this has dull eyes!

Most secret gathering place, nectar speech, unceasing self-resounding. Who hasn't heard this—are they earless? Self-abiding expanse and awareness' scent, never separate, self-circulating.

Feelings experienced, sense gates stopped? Three essences' pith instruction, single taste—primordially body mind nectar. Not experiencing this—tongue cut?

Your own mind's display is all you ever see! Don't make it complicated.

Emaho! Everything primordially pure!
