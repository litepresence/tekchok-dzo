Listen, yogin! First Samantabhadra capacity equal! This habituated measure arrived, stone-with light liberated! Not arrived, bardo or nature emanated field travel! Six realms delusion precipice cut!

Thus introduced! From Self-Arisen Instructions: "Thus whoever sees person, first Samantabhadra, capacity itself equal!" From Spontaneous Liberation: "Hanging-cord's nature, conceptuality all pure, not-deluded base buddha!"

[4858–4890]
Lu like water's water-vessel good, water increase-decrease not emerging! Body and wisdom increase-gate various, path-vision complete until, from that emerges! Gu that within dharmata not-reversed view and meditation pull!

Emaho! Lu-gu-rgyud of wisdom!

This is the direct path of the Great Perfection! No gradual stages, no elaborate practices—just recognition of what is already present!

Emaho! Direct liberation!
