Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmata, controlling the great eye and clairvoyance, obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms. The all-ground subtle knowable obscurations very cut—except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations. This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion." Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations, entering the primordially pure dharmakaya of the inner expanse, the very peace.

From the Thal 'gyur: The dharmata of self-Buddha cessation: Elements ceasing, dust ceases, dust and particles ultimately cease, not even a mere part abides. Afflictions ceasing, delusion and concept-free attachment not abiding, latencies and all-arising not even dust-parts abide. Thus through subtle and coarse cessation, the five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end, the body of four elements exhausted, all is wisdom, Sambhogakaya. Concept-free samadhi self-abiding, having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication, "Dharma" does not abide in words.

The empty dharmata: through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds, mind and mental-events exhaust. The vision aspect of body and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon, also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially pure vision, this is expressed as "the dharmakaya vision, the core result dharmata, self-vision."

Again from the previous: The dharmata of cause and result: Coarse conceptuality source ceasing, memory self-pure from the continuum also, dependent-arising wind itself fully pure, the dharmata arising from cause. To the primordially pure nature, the numbers of one and many exhaust, body and wisdom non-existent, arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—considered to be the result dharmata. Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.

Emaho! White silk curtain—thin as thought, cut it now!
