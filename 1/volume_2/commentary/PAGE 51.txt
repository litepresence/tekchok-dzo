[2506-2526] By fixing mind upon letters, orbs of light, or mandalas of sun and moon—rising ever higher until they sink into space, becoming invisible—experience arises of emptiness utterly free from conceptual mind. By placing mind within ear and holding it thus, simultaneous and one-pointed, arises experience of sound-meditation. By holding mind upon subtle divine form within heart, arises pure clear-light experience. Thus bardo clear-light matures, and divine form, ring-sel, and rainbow lights manifest. Third: seven sets demonstrating seeing of dharmata. Holding mind upon gradual emptiness: first, cool body's many parts, analyze them with many names and so forth, upon head alone cool with many names. When those names examined for meaning and meaning dissolves into atoms, seek where name abides—when not found, within that state where nothing moves in mind—emptiness displayed in depths—without searching, anger, remembrance or thought, place simultaneously. Experience of emptiness without duality arises. Apply to all appearances exactly as body is. Holding mind upon instantaneous emptiness: whatever appears, when intensely viewed, think "emptiness cleared, cleared, cleared away." Train upon all form-appearances, sound-appearances, and so forth. Experience like placing upon mirror arises. Holding mind upon impermanence: training appearances to be without fixation. Whatever appears without fixation, without truth—appearing variously, thus not true—becoming without boundary, through impermanence—thinking thus and training—arises experience of separation from planetary fixation. Upon whatever appears of five elements, awareness just-big, placed without distraction—liberation in that very place—experience like dream arises. Holding mind upon non-thought: appearances whatever appears, awareness whatever becomes—moment's continuum without parts—thought-free—primordially abides—recognizing that, gathering, reaching, training—arises great thought-free self-abiding meditation. Holding mind upon union.

Emaho! Seven dharmata see!
