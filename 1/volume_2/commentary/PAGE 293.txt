Listen, child of good lineage! Seventh: birth-place purification ritual [14621-14640]—three: death-point purification, corpse purification, subsequent purification.

First [14641-14660]: Sun-Moon Union, "A syllable's connection, breath and that number joined; if then not dead, crown mouth-directed, breath, awareness body's center also, a contemplated gathering do."

Thus ritual-possessed time [14661-14680]: that person's breath not separated, syllable breath with doubtless abiding purifying. Generally beings not seeing this Dharma's door, higher realms drawn, this method shown.

That person's heart inside [14681-14700] white light sphere egg-like contemplated, gradually upward-going contemplated, together with own also that consciousness thus contemplated; oneself also that consciousness thus contemplated, with that person's age-years wind outward going long and short joined, short time with vowel reciting.

Breath rough going time [14701-14720], that crown mouth-directed, a-a twenty-one spoken, wind phu-ru-ru comes, even evil one higher realm proceeds; intellectual view-meditation also dharmata proceeds.

If hell-birth signs [14721-14740], breath-separating time, that consciousness heart or navel a-contemplated, five lights fire burnt, own upper garment moment abiding, place upward proceeds.

Emaho!
