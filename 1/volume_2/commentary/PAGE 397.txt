Listen carefully! Longchenpa is explaining how designation works. "From the dharmas of mere designation aspect, ripened as body, without substantial existence." This is subtle—don't miss it! The body appears, yes, but it's ripened from mere designation, not from some solid thing. Characteristics by which nothing is definitively established. Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called Dharmakaya!

This is the crucial point: Dharmakaya is not "something" that exists somewhere. It's the recognition that there's no solid, findable essence. Like trying to grasp a rainbow—you can't, yet it appears. This appearance without graspability is Dharmakaya!

[16428-16432]
Now the breakdown: Dharma means unstained dharmas of the Buddha ground, connected with awareness. Body means without marks, faces, or hands, merely spoken of as the essence of unchanging awareness. Don't look for a Buddha-form in Dharmakaya! No arms, no legs, no ornaments—just the naked fact of awareness itself, unchanging, ungraspable, yet vividly present.

[16432-16440]
Divisions: Three Dharmakayas related to essence-characteristics, all-pervading abiding, and appearance-modes of divisions. First: With reference to suchness, nowhere established as any essence, free from elaboration extremes. Beyond holding to entity limits, without birth, death, transference, or change. Ultimate directly manifesting, suchness beyond thought.

This is pointing to the unfindable nature. Look for yourself—can you find the "thing" that's aware? Can you point to awareness? You can't! Yet it's undeniable. This unfindability is not a problem to solve—it's liberation itself!

[16440-16453]
Second: Dharmakaya pervading all samsara and nirvana, possessing the two purities—pure of adventitious stains. From Hevajra: "Sentient beings are Buddha, only obscured by adventitious stains. Once removed, they are Buddha." And from Uttaratantra: "Perfect Buddha-body because it radiates, because suchness is undifferentiable, because of possessing potential—therefore all beings always possess Buddha-nature."

Emaho! What news! You're not becoming Buddha—you ARE Buddha, just temporarily obscured like the sun behind clouds. The clouds aren't the sun's nature, and your confusion isn't your nature. Remove the obscuration, and what's left? Buddha! Not a new acquisition, but recognition of what's always been!

[16453-16466]
Third: Shown as aspects of awareness, emptiness, qualities, etc., according to respective vehicles. In this great complete perfection, if divided by display: Dharmakaya's Dharmakaya fields beyond thought. Suchness abiding beyond thought and expression. Great unmoving samadhi. Circle manifold, nature non-dual. Teaching unspeakable suchness. Suchness unchanging at any time.

Dharmakaya's Sambhogakaya fields, free from dust, stainless. Abode memory and mental thought self-dissolved. Samadhi, mind and mental factors' experience ceased, pristine awareness self-abiding.

Do you see? Every possible description still doesn't capture it. Yet these "fields" and "qualities" are not far away—they're the display of your own rigpa, right now, manifesting as the world you perceive!
