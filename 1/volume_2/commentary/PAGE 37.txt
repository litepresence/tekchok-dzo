[Line range] Listen, friend! This passage is not just words on a page—it is direct pointing to your own nature.

The teachings here reveal how confusion and liberation are not two separate things. Like water and ice—they're the same substance, just different manifestations.

Don't think you need to go somewhere else to find awakening. It's right here, in this very moment, completely untouched by all your concepts and worries.

The path is not about becoming something better. It's about recognizing what you already are, what you've always been.

Look directly at your own mind. Don't analyze, don't judge—just see.

Emaho! Recognition is liberation!
