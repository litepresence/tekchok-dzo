[4289-4293] Listen! From Vajra Stacked Palace: "Whoever's conceptualized wheel itself, who can turn it? Afterward that one's mind-stream ceases!"

[4294-4303] Then without projection-gathering, natural settling mindfulness' aperture self-ceases! From Glorious Sky Light: "Perception cut, aperture ceases!" Also body speech two without attachment, mind's root cut conduct appropriate. Self-traceless training, liberated from three realms! From Wheel Stacked: "Who divided mind's border, this not turning into mind!"

[4304-4308] Thus dividing border conduct three makes not entering three realms! From Near Empowerment: "Whichever border divided, not turning in three realms, to that natural settling shown!"

Do you see? Divide the border! Mind-stream ceases! Not entering three realms!

Emaho! Dividing the wheel's border!
