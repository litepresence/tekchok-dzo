Listen! These twenty appearance-birth modes complete in seven days. Intermediate existence that life, seven days passed, exhausted. If no life from that? Again latency's power, former appearance awakened, mind body taken, seven times die. Seven times birth appears, like dream's birth-death. Seven births also miraculously born. Death and birth all done in instant. If virtue's power applied, seven sevens' seven periods greatly beneficial. That too, seven births abiding appearance seven, death appearance seven—twenty-first one. Body taking's long extreme. Seven sets seven, forty-nine days. Within that, karma different, bodies separately taken. Generally intermediate life's short extreme seven days, long extreme forty-nine, between that.

That too, in desire realm untimely death like, there also untimely karma-death exists, karma exhausted longer also exists, yet made intermediate's power. Birth-death appearance's cause: Former death remembering, above day-night's part whatever died's time, that also dies. Birth remembering, instantly born.

Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing. God-human birth, white. Demi-god and animal birth, yellow. Hungry ghost birth, smoke-like. Hell birth, black wool scattered-like. This continuum: From above Sambhogakaya's color and hand-emblem seeing. Eighth, head-looking's difference: God-human birth, upward. Demi-god animal, sideways. Hungry ghost hell, downward. Ninth, accumulating not accumulating: Coarse manifest not accumulating, subtle latency mind's power depending, accumulating.

Emaho! The bardo isn't endless—you have about 49 days maximum! Every seven days you "die" and are "reborn" in the bardo until you find a new body. But if you recognize the nature of these appearances, you can be liberated instantly. Don't waste this precious time!
