**Tibetan Reference:** Lines [13889-13910]

My dear ones, the eight modes of arising are: arising like compassion cuts samsara-nirvana's boundary; arising like light makes all appearances internally clear; arising like form prevents losing the objects of knowledge externally; arising like wisdom makes all appearances pure from the ground; arising like non-duality makes your awareness dwell one-pointedly; arising like freedom from extremes means not abiding anywhere; arising like impure samsara's gate means existence's source isn't stopped; arising like pure wisdom's gate means dharmata and awareness connect as mother and child [13889-13895].

At this time, remember the supreme method—like the archer's arrow shot forth without returning [13896].

When rigpa dissolves into spontaneous accomplishment, at that very moment you reach the irreversible precious king's palace without having exited the gate—this is the extremely important essential instruction [13897-13898].

Now, though you recognize the ground-display of clear light with its loop and thigle, if you do not turn back from that to the ordinary, you arrive at thodgal. At that time, it collapses [13899].

The text quotes the Talgyur: "The dharmata of rigpa is explained. Seeing directly in the loop, the moving recollections of conceptual thought cease. Like birds flying in space, there's no going from dharmadhatu. Through pure rigpa-display without other, the causes and conditions of deluded appearance are exhausted" [13900-13908].

Emaho!
