Listen! Outer view guidance teaching showing—all three realms empty from beginning. Middle view guidance—dharmata's three natures appear as result path. Inner view guidance—ground's essentiality spontaneously present.

Explanation from Short path: Among all vehicles, surpasser is Ati's scriptural treasure—naturally abiding dharmata, primordially pure, untainted by grasping. Two reasons for completeness: Perfect vehicle perfect, Ati's intention perfect. Three reasons for being supreme: ultimate emptiness, subtle compassion, omniscient wisdom.

Then view development: Seer-view—six empties through Mahayana path; Hearers-view—learning at teacher's feet; Practitioner-view—three absorptions taught to train faculties.

Outer view: cause-effect emptiness appearance—no inherent nature through analysis. Middle view: emptiness of dharmata that is transcendence supreme. Inner view: non-arisen emptiness beyond extremes.

Emaho! Three views of ultimate emptiness!
