Listen closely, my heart-sons and heart-daughters! At this time, you must remember the supreme method—like the golden hook [13850]. The spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel appearance has six aspects: how it arises, how subsequent memory is born, how clairvoyance arises, how dharani is obtained, how samadhi is born, and how spontaneous accomplishment dissolves [13851-13856].

The arising: When wisdom spontaneously accomplishes and dissolves, in that instant, all previous appearances and your own awareness gather into the upper light path, and from within that, they shine forth [13857-13860].

The eight modes of arising appear:
- Arising like compassion: samsara and nirvana's boundary is cut
- Arising like light: all appearances are internally clear
- Arising like form: the objects of knowledge are not lost externally
- Arising like wisdom: all appearances are pure from the ground
- Arising like non-duality: your own awareness dwells one-pointedly
- Arising like freedom from extremes: not abiding in any extreme
- Arising like the gate of impure samsara: the source of existence is not stopped
- Arising like the gate of pure wisdom: dharmata and awareness are connected like mother and child [13861-13869]

Emaho!
