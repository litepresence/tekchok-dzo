Fortunate child, understand! That also like present clear light carrier [14281-14300], bardo's clear light like that carrier, those two bridge-joined; space-awareness carrier similar appearance shown: "Son of family, this present clear light is self-arisen wisdom itself—without modifying mind, rest in this nature; upward zangthal you become Buddha."

Also [14301-14320]: "Look without changing this appearance; present clear light dharmata mother's clear light, all appearances buddha-fields dawning, mixed will become; that time recognize self-appearance; that time ka-dag ground you become Buddha."

There not recognizing [14321-14340], clear light lhundrub dissolving time, kaya and wisdom's appearance dawns; then four wisdoms' meeting appearance dawns; then lhundrub's eight doors dawning—you recognize self-appearance; self-recognized immediately ka-dag ground you well-go, three times spoken; oneself also that appearance equally placed, again there clear pointing.

That certainly liberates [14341-14360]. Sun-Moon Union: "If space-awareness unclear, dharmata bliss bardo, rigpa's appearance grasping, before shown lights mind-do; that obtains true appearance. If those unclear, own guru present, above instruction clearly point; no guru, vajra sibling, awareness's clear pointing do."

Thus instructions pointing [14361-14380], prolonged death or dharma-view disharmonious others, death-point with three jewel instructions benefit others shown: breath outer stopped, inner not stopped time, oneself momentary dharmata direct intention placed; then other person's breath separated, gap that mouth-nose three and own mouth-nose three joined.

Emaho!
