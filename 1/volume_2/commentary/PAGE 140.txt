Emanation and blessings! Mantras and samaya transform body and mind.

Outer emanation: body emanates deities through mantra, like sun radiating countless rays. Outer emanation comes from vital winds and channels purifying through mantra recitation—like cleaning a dusty window until you can see through clearly.

Inner emanation: mind emanates as bliss emptiness, like space manifesting as luminous. This happens through channel winds entering central channel—like wind gathering clouds.

Secret emanation: combination of outer and inner—body as deity mandala, mind as bliss emptiness, inseparable.

Samaya protection: Samaya of mantra binds harmful spirits and prevents obstacles—like having invisible guardians. Mantra samaya makes mantra effective—like king's seal making commands unbreakable.

Blessing transmission: Samaya of blessing transmits guru's realization to disciple—like a king passing his authority to ministers.

Then mantra powers: supernatural abilities arise naturally when channels pure—flying, invisibility, transformation, all without effort.

Emaho! Mantra recites, world transforms!
