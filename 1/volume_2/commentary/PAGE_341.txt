You who seek liberation, listen! Thus sixty-eight in the first of six clairvoyances; twenty-four each in second and third; six each in remaining three—dividing parts makes one hundred thirty-four [14199-14201].

These also gather into six groups. The thirty-six, the fifth, sense faculty way seeing six, have outflows [14202-14203]. The first group's five faculties' seeing others thirty are without outflows [14204]. Know the final as extremely without outflows [14205].

These also, from Union of Sun and Moon: "Thus arising, in that type, six clairvoyances arise: knowing past births, death and transition, birth, others' minds, invisible hidden all knowing, seeing and knowing six realms' abodes, and faculties purified clairvoyance—six arise" [14206-14214].

The fourth, how dharani is obtained: All previously heard Dharma arises simultaneously, and previously unheard teachings also arise without measure, so called "dharmata bardo" [14215-14217].

From that: "At that time, unforgetting dharanis also arise in your own continuum. All previous teachings arise simultaneously in the continuum. Likewise, previously unheard teachings also arise, so called dharmata bardo" [14219-14224].

Emaho!
