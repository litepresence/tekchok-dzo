[1420-1428] Listen, practitioner! When defilements are purified and Buddha is realized, two pristine cognitions manifest as result—hear this distinction! There is the Buddha of realized manifestation and the Buddha of nature's spontaneous accomplishment. Though the primordial nature is spontaneously established, one must still realize and manifest it.

The term "pristine cognition" has no definitive fixed meaning—like pointing at the sky, the finger is not the sky itself!

[1429-1501] Three distinctions and two certain terms—pay attention! First, the five aspects: dharmadhatu pristine cognition without concept, mirror-like without ceasing yet clear, equality pristine cognition unmixed and complete, discerning pristine cognition realizing like before, action-accomplishing pristine cognition completing dharmas.

Apply word-meanings thus: dharmadhatu pristine cognition—great emptiness as object, clear light as appearance, pristine cognition as awareness engaging objects. These three gathered are called "expanse"—with two aspects: pure pristine cognition expanse and impure beings' expanse.

Mirror-like pristine cognition—example: mirror mandala. Whatever conditions come, it shows them. Similarly, stainless awareness becomes afflicted by conditions, yet when liberated through introduction, you know your own mark!

Equality pristine cognition—dharmas equal in essence, falling in no direction, equality Buddha lord of all. Discerning pristine cognition—awareness realizing various aspects separately. Action-accomplishing—whatever appears, awareness' nature is complete, action without concept.

Thus, know the great pristine cognition! Realize authentically, liberate with certainty!

Emaho! The five pristine cognitions complete in awareness!
