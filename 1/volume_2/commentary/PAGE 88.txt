From Dakini Drwa Ba Tongden Gyur: "Desiring siddhi, make offerings to guru until end of time." This also doesn't transcend body speech mind.

Body conduct pleasing guru: offering seat, mandala, service, pressing legs, permission prostration, seeing prostration, etc. Permission-prostration is when guru looks at oneself, prostrating. Seeing-prostration is when seeing one's guru.

Speech expression pleasing guru: not guru's faults, focusing on qualities, speaking distinctive words. Yidam knowing pleasing guru: following guru's conduct, guru pleased, mindful of leading others. Making others enter through faith in guru.

Skill in guru's oral instruction—words no excess-deficiency, able to express to others. Not deviating from actually practicing guru's mind intention as it is.

Emaho! Guru devotion is the swift path!
