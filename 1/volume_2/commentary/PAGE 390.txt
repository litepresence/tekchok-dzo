Listen! Compassion serves as the ground-appearance for two pristine awarenesses, yet there's no direct measurement of objects and aspects. From Thal 'gyur: "That too abiding as essence-body, dharmas and Dharma enjoyment emanation aspect, without dividing, without division mode, established from manner, from that—body colors, etc., not mind's object. Nature appearing-maker light mode. White, red, yellow, green, blue—not mark possessing entities, established from class-free knowables' manner. From compassion's various appearances, not one certain like this, therefore called 'ground' for various appearances."

Emaho! Do you see? The colors and forms aren't solid things—they're the play of light, the natural radiance of awareness. Like a rainbow has no substantial existence yet appears vividly, the kayas appear without being "things." Don't grasp at forms, don't reject them—let them be the spontaneous display!

From Six Expanses too: "Possessing marks self-pure, abiding as ground of great clear depth. Empty of pervader and pervaded, not cut from edge, appearing clear. Appearing-maker appearance aspect not ceased. All essences gathered, stainless, self-pure. Buddhas' great secret, abiding in nature's aspect. From compassion's various appearance aspects, emptiness aspect without cessation. Two knowable pristine awarenesses appear from appearance aspect. From non-existence's self-pure appearance, natural dynamic compassion, without effort of activity, without division in unmade appearance mode, primordially without division appears. Like sun's light, not self-made, nature itself thus appears."

This is describing how the display works! Compassion isn't something Buddha "does"—it's what awareness naturally does, like light naturally illuminates. The five colors aren't "out there"—they're the way awareness displays itself. Don't solidify, don't reject—recognize the play!

"Knowing knowables as they are, compassion aspect's pristine awareness, knowing own thing's mode. Without that pristine awareness' aspect, what's the difference from four elements' forms? Knowing all knowables, compassion's pristine awareness, knowing trainees' thoughts. Without this, equal to mere space. Therefore all-knowing pristine awareness appears in compassion's aspect. Not held by memory, abiding as nature itself. Grasping-grasped coarsely not abiding. Clear depth subtle aspect appearing, this is sentient beings' path. Increasing like seed above. This appearance not ceased, like suitable medicine's power, appearing suitably to six families. Therefore compassion."

Don't you see? This "compassion" isn't sentiment—it's the knowing-quality of awareness itself. Without it, Buddha would be no different from a rock. With it, Buddha knows all beings' needs without effort, like a mirror reflecting without deciding what to reflect!

That too from ground-appearance aspect, when appearing as Nirmanakaya, the two pristine awarenesses also actually benefit the six families of trainees...

This is the completion of the explanation—showing how the three kayas and five wisdoms actually function to benefit beings. Not theoretical, not abstract—this is the living reality of awakening!
