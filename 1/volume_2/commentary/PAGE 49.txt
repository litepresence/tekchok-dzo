From that itself: By the twenty-one progressive trainings of mind-holding—first, placing on the ground; second, separating body-mind; third, seeing dharmata. At this time, possessing the body, speech, and mind piths, the yogin should settle. Mixing the moving wind-horse, throwing and gathering, if you rely skillfully on the three piths, mind's thoughts' continuum ceases. Thus spoke the meaning—to take into experience in three.

Listen! Now Longchenpa is giving you specific meditation techniques. Twenty-one progressive trainings for holding the mind. He condenses them into three main phases:

First: Settling the mind on the ground—finding stability, establishing the foundation.
Second: Separating body and mind—loosening the identification with physical form.
Third: Seeing dharmata—recognizing the nature of reality.

This is the path! You start by settling, then you separate, then you see. Don't think you can skip ahead. If you try to see dharmata before you've settled the mind, you'll just be imagining things. If you try to separate body-mind before settling, you'll just be scattered.

The three piths—body, speech, and mind—must be possessed, meaning you work with all three. The wind-horse (your energy, your prana) must be mixed with the practice, thrown out and gathered in. When you do this skillfully, thoughts naturally cease. Not by force, not by suppression, but by the natural power of the practice.

Seven groups—first, self-mind dwelling on the ground. Second, body-mind separated from grasping attachment. Third, showing the seeing of dharmata.

First, the seven characteristics: Holding mind on white A. Suitable ground, comfortable cushion, body sitting cross-legged, meditate on white A shining at the nose-tip. When wind goes out, A also goes out. When drawing in, A also comes in—think this and mix with wind and meditate.

This is the White A practice—a classic Dzogchen technique. You visualize a white Tibetan letter A at the tip of your nose. As you breathe out, it goes out with the breath. As you breathe in, it comes in. You synchronize the visualization with your breathing. This gives the mind something to focus on while also working with the energy.

Why the nose-tip? This is the meeting point of the inner and outer. The breath comes in and out here. By placing the A here, you're working at the threshold between your inner world and the outer world.

If the body has hot disease, think that A has cold touch. If cold disease, think hot touch. Train day and night. An uncommon experience of mind free from emanating and gathering arises. All body-piths and wind-piths are equal.

This is the healing aspect! The visualization isn't just for concentration—it's also medicine. Hot disease, you visualize cooling. Cold disease, you visualize heating. The mind has power over the body when you know how to use it.

If dull, holding mind on the letter PHA—put one-pointed awareness, and saying PHAT fiercely, awareness comes thought-free, ha-de-ba, until thoughts don't arise, hold the mind, also saying PHAT day and night, taking into experience, mind emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation arises.

When you're dull, sleepy, scattered—use PHAT! This is fierce. PHAT is a wrathful mantra syllable. You say it sharply, fiercely. It cuts through the dullness like a sword. The awareness becomes sharp, clear, thought-free. This is the nature of mind itself—emptiness and clarity together.

Also, holding mind on the wrathful one's pleasure laugh. Saying HA fiercely and short, placing mind as before, thought-free clear resonance experience arises.

The wrathful deities' laughter—HA! Short, fierce, cutting through everything. This is another technique for when you need sharpness, clarity, intensity.

Holding mind on asuras' quarrel and dispute—sitting on mountain-peaks or rock-tops, etc.

This is about taking the challenging energy of conflict and using it as the path. Asuras are always fighting—this represents our own aggressive, competitive mind. Instead of suppressing it, you take it to a high place (mountain peak) and use that energy.

Emaho! These are the skillful means—twenty-one ways to work with the mind!
