Awareness main point: hanging-cord, dhatu fence, not-move. From Self-face awareness: hanging-cord, going-coming separate, sky capture. From Instruction-Child: dhatu inside hanging-cord, place arrange, not separate. Relying on slow wind, action separate meaning arises in mind. Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead, conceptuality source exhausted. Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet. Awareness separate from wind, going-coming not-existing—self-arisen awareness enters.

If guide, rely on body main point—do five-six days. Then practice gate, only that much. Then seek field, six-seven days. Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience. Very purified, meditation knowing arises. Wrong or not-wrong cause, see flickering vision, no faith—when guide finishes, nothing to say. Various divinations arise near—make pure those not gone thus. General guide applied: preliminary measure arrives, purify with diligence, actual main faith, not ordinary, arises. Actual main: hit point-delivery, direct delight special arises. Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut, knowing capable of maintaining experience practice, doubt and conceptuality end, mind not desiring other dharma.

Second: introduce awareness self-face directly. Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like, with dhatu luminous-clear vision. This, not-deluded buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance. Look at state: all concept-doers pure, elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within. Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent, meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.

Emaho! The golden thread of awareness suspends you in open sky!
