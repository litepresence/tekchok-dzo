Listen here, dear practitioner! Do you not see how the visions of clarity dawn upon the path like the moon waxing full? When family differences arise in the mind [5177], do not grasp at them as real! The wisdom wind purifies all causes, and like a mirror standing upright [5178], the vision of mirror-like awareness naturally arises.

Look! Through practice and experience, these visions increase [5179]. The wing of equality dawns [5180], and delusion's vision exhausts itself near its own source [5181]. Then comes the discriminate vision, like boat-parts assembling [5182]. When subtle elements cease [5183], the victory-banner of accomplished action manifests as vision alone [5184].

Dear one, wisdom's self-resonance arises as individual clarity [5185], and the wisdom field becomes like a boat of conceptuality's coarseness ceasing [5186]. These paths arise in sequence [5187] - for those of great diligence, five days and five days; for middling practitioners, seven and seven; for lesser, twenty-one and twenty-one days [5188-5190].

See how below these visions, forms dawn with colors and shapes abiding for moments [5192-5193]? When these cease, the five wisdom shapes dawn [5193] - mirror-like shapes like spots in the eye [5194], increasing in excellent color [5195], with many lines dawning to the eye [5196]. This is the preliminary measure arriving [5197].

Then the net of equality dawns halfway [5198], purifying the wind completely [5199], completing the preliminary pure vision [5200]. Then heaps of flowers dawn [5201] through effortful gazing [5202], purifying the preliminary with thousand-petaled lotuses [5203]. Then weapon-like forms dawn [5204] with unfabricated nature [5205], completing the preliminary with wheels and various forms [5206]. Finally, the palace of dharmadhatu wisdom dawns [5207].

Thus practitioner, do not be distracted! These visions are your own nature displaying itself. Emaho!
