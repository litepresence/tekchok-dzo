Look here, friend! Now we're getting to the heart of the matter—the bardo instructions. Longchenpa's not just theorizing; he's giving you the practical keys for those crucial moments between death and rebirth.

First, he divides this into two: the crucial point of union realization practiced in this life, and the actual bardo instruction. Listen carefully—the first one is what you do NOW, while you're still breathing. The second is what you remember THEN, when the breath stops.

[3349-3357]
Generally, there are many bardo distinctions, but here we focus on what's needed: birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, and existence bardo. From these four chapters, we train capacity using the first two.

What does this mean practically? During daytime, work with the illusory body and clear light crucial points. Become familiar with how the bardo arises. Then in dream, you'll have mastery—that's your measure of certainty for bardo liberation.

[3358-3372]
If you condense this into one crucial point:
- Don't deliberately abandon existence
- Don't deliberately establish non-existence  
- Don't cling obviously to existence
- Don't make sad thoughts about non-existence

Whatever you do, good or bad, whatever appears, whatever grasping thought arises—don't cut past traces, don't welcome future hopes, don't depend on present latencies with antidotes.

Feel the meaning here! Not stretched, not puffed, not hesitant. Practice so that appearances touch mind without trace arising. Liberate appearances at the moment of appearance!

[3373-3389]
This is the key instruction: liberate grasping at things. Liberate at the appearance-moment itself—like a bird taking flight leaves no trace. Liberate at the movement-moment—the trace self-dissolves, like hail dissolving in space.

Liberate appearance and consciousness into non-dual—outer and inner without boundary, like water dissolving into water. Realize this, cut latency attachment!

From Klongchenpa's Six Essentials: whatever person doesn't cut past traces, doesn't raise future hopes, if they put present consciousness in its place—mixing non-existent before and after—this is called "one-gathered essence," the yogi realizes the three times as equal.

Emaho! Practice this now, friend. Don't wait for the bardo to test these instructions!
