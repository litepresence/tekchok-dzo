Example: all salts' taste established, or molasses, or fire—knowing one knows all. From Bodhicitta Commentary: "Fire's nature hot, molasses' nature sweet—thus all dharmas' nature empty one."

Thus five liberation modes not for one individual—by sense-faculty differences, whichever suitable liberates.

Third: five liberation modes' conclusion showing five: here five liberation modes free from reference—self-liberation free from object view-meditation-conduct dharma reference. Conditions liberated by conditions—like stain washed by stain, bad conditions liberated by bad, dawn as wisdom's companion.

Primordial purity liberated by primordial purity, rigpa liberated by rigpa.

Primordial liberation free from grasping-grasped unified reference—objects liberated by objects, like poison destroyed by poison.

Naked liberation not referencing samsara-nirvana—causes liberated by causes, like iron cut by iron.

Extreme liberation not referencing terminology words—dharmas liberated by dharmas, like wood-born fire burning that wood.

One liberation not referencing liberating mind—mind itself liberated by mind, like stone breaking stones.

From Pearl Garland: "Conditions liberated by conditions—I don't look at object dharmas. Objects liberated by objects—I don't look at grasping-grasped two. Causes liberated by causes—I don't look at samsara-nirvada two. Dharmas liberated by dharmas—I don't look at terminology words. Mind liberated by mind—I don't look at indicating mind..."

Emaho! Self-liberation in five modes!
