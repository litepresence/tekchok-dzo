[13306-13332]
You there—when the five waters dissolve into water, the body's water drains, mouth and nose dry, eyes roll upward. When five fires dissolve into fire, body's heat spreads, memory stops, the lamp's appearance ceases. When five winds dissolve into wind, body's radiance gone, breath gasping then stops. Then the inner elements' dissolution manner: when the five spaces dissolve into dharmadhatu-rigpa, recognition happens! When inner earth dissolves into outer earth, body loses power—like a mountain crumbling to dust.

Emaho! The body returns to the elements—like a dream fading at dawn!
