From Self-Arising: "When lion utters its own roar, all carnivores faint and fear. When Great Perfection speaks its own words, all lower vehicles faint."

Therefore, this secret instruction for those without fortune who take cause and effect as definitive—keep secret! From the earlier text: "These words, don't speak them even a speck among hearers and self-Buddhas. Why? When they hear these words, they become fearful, terrified, faint. Not faithful to secret mantras, despising them—through that ripening they'll experience great hell. So don't even speak in the direction of wind!"

From general Secret Mantra: "To immature beings, revealing secret is the seventh root downfall."

From Bodhisattva Bhumis: "Showing emptiness to untrained mind is explained as root downfall." Therefore secret!

The eight marvelous words purifying eight consciousness-collections, twelve unchanging great adamantine letters—these bind to dharma-exhausted beyond-mind. Explained so heart-vessels don't contract. Without hope, doubt, binding, grasping—samsara-nirvana at one time released into great namelessness.

For great yogins who reach this nature, cause-effect virtue-vice explained directly—like Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Tilopa. For us, though mind understands thus, not arriving through familiarity, so explain combined with not fearing nature and being careful about subtle karmic cause-effect.

Thus twelve vajra laughs explained three times as three bindings become thirty-six—corresponding to purifying the twelve links of dependent origination: direct, reverse, and completely cut.

Emaho! Secret teachings for those with fortune!
