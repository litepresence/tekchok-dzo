[5963-5968] Listen here, dear practitioner! Dharmas exhausted, intellect-transcended meaning—zinc-tin reliance, wisdom change-change not recognized! In effortless vast great expanse, all primordially transcended. Bondage and liberation, abandon-accept not-existing manner—samsara nirvana nameless great roll!

[5969-5977] First three: Nature Dzogchen byar not sky-like meaning generally shown. Bondage liberation non-dual, own-mind emptiness root-free great thig-decided. Object-vision, mind's mirror collection, six great pervade! Outer vision, inner awareness, between grasping-holding, vision signs, samsara nirvana gathered dharmas all—primordial emptiness universal emptiness great! Appearance-emptiness, intellect-emptiness great! Pure-emptiness, liberation-emptiness great! Not experienced existent, not experienced non-existent. Not experienced true, not experienced false. Not experienced deluded, not experienced liberated. Not experienced samsara!

Do you see? Not experienced! All these categories—samsara, nirvana, true, false—you never experienced them! They are empty from the start!

Emaho! The three great emptinesses—beyond all experience!
