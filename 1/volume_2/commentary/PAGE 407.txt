Knowing the ultimate dharma-nature—emptiness, marklessness, luminosity—manifests the Dharma. This also from the Thalgyur:

"On nirmanakaya, knowables—
Knowing how things are,
Knows the natural state as own purpose.
Knowing how many,
Knows however trainees' minds abide.

Thus from compassion's manner of arising,
For trainees' various migrations,
Taming kayas are just that much."

Thus.

Here's the profound point: Nirmanakaya isn't separate from knowing. The emanation body appears based on knowing the natural state (how things truly are) and knowing trainees' minds (what they need). The taming kayas appear spontaneously from compassion, not from effort or contrivance.

This means the forms in which the Buddha appears—whatever forms benefit beings—are not fixed. They appear based on what needs to be tamed. Don't get attached to thinking the Buddha looks a certain way!

[16899-16922]
The meaning of these wisdoms gathered in the three kayas, clearly summarized:

To such a Buddha, in the condition of dharmakaya, three wisdoms complete in the basis:
Essence primordially pure wisdom,
Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom,
Compassion all-pervading wisdom—
Without characteristics divided into types,
From awareness' clear portion, force or power,
Makes the basis of arising of knowing.

In the condition of sambhogakaya, the five wisdoms possessing characteristics are clear individually:
Dharmadhatu,
Mirror-like,
Sameness,
Discriminating,
All-accomplishing wisdoms—
Not object and subject, but close self-clear appearance.

At the time of nirmanakaya, two knowing wisdoms abide:
Knowing how things are and knowing how many.

These two also, with action and actor, are not—
Knowing in the manner of effortless spontaneous accomplishment.

Thus, the three wisdoms possessed by the Buddha's three kayas:
From the perspective of knowing the two—appearance and emptiness—of knowables appearing externally to nirmanakaya, all-knowing wisdom of dharma's nature peace; from the perspective of knowing self-clear appearance of sambhogakaya's close self-appearance luminosity-wisdom's knowables, all-knowing wisdom; dharmakaya inner-clear essence abiding wisdom portion merely making basis of arising.

This is sophisticated Dzogchen cosmology. Let me break it down simply:

- **Dharmakaya wisdom**: The basis, primordially pure, spontaneously present, all-pervading compassion. This is your own nature.
- **Sambhogakaya wisdom**: The five wisdoms that appear as light, as clarity, as the mandala of deities. This is the display of your nature.
- **Nirmanakaya wisdom**: The two knowings—knowing reality and knowing what beings need. This is how your nature benefits others.

They're not separate! They're three aspects of the same wisdom. When you recognize your own awareness, you recognize all three. Stop dividing them!

Emaho! Three kayas, three wisdoms, one nature!
