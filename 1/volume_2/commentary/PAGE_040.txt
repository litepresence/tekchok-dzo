Listen carefully, friend! From Jewel Heap Sutra: "That order specific thus, order-arrange itself-as practice take!" Four lords' manner, four meaning essences grasp, four object-awareness, thus appearance arising-stream sever!

Four placement methods: appearance-existence dharmas self-release, pure-mode liberated key, afflictions self-power transform! Four examples confidence self-face show, unchanging view confidence great four, irreversible wisdom measure grasp!

Accustomed ones: nature Great Perfection touch, samaya thus appear, primordial wisdom core comprehend, secret great mudra obtain! Practice steps: first conduct continuous—appearance power-transform conduct! Oral instruction appearance release method, appearance-existence basis-establish intent, afflictions location-transform result!

Conduct essence: not-clinging grasping conduct, negation-affirmation nonexistent conduct, clinging attachment-nonexistent conduct! Cause characteristics vehicle conduct, path common enter—not quickly liberated! Self-Arisen: not-clinging grasping conduct, characteristics vehicle meaning-by clinging great-bound!

Emaho! Fourfold conduct of the Great Perfection!
