Inner instruction now: ten stages of ground path. These are preliminary to precious trainings but main to view—path is ground. As Longchenpa says: "These are vital points of all vehicles, essence of Buddha's path."

First four: attention, accompaniment, non-distraction, application. Attention—mind rests in emptiness without shifting. Accompaniment—effortless natural action, like child's play. Non-distraction—mind stays focused despite activities. Application—post-meditation conduct of merit and wisdom.

Next three: conduct, accustomization, maturation, stabilization. Conduct—avoid harmful deeds, physical stillness. Accustomization—body comfortable, speech pleasant, mind pliable, time without boundaries. Maturation—becoming accustomed to meditation's warm gentle nature. Stabilization—naturally abiding without movement.

Then three: culmination, pathlessness, maturation. Culmination—familiarization with realization. Pathlessness—seeing practice in reality. Maturation—stabilization sustained, qualities of arising.

Emaho! Ten stages, one path!
