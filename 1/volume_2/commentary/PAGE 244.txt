Listen now to the signs of delusion! [11806-11830] Just as there are signs of realization, there are also signs of going astray. If you see displays but attachment arises, this is the demon of attachment. If you feel pride thinking 'I am special,' this is the demon of pride. If you fear the displays, this is the demon of fear. These must be recognized as obstacles.

[11831-11855] When displays arise but you do not recognize them as your own face, you wander in delusion. Like a deer chasing a mirage, you pursue empty forms. This is the pitfall of thod rgal practice. You must have the lama's introduction and your own recognition.

[11856-11880] Some practitioners see lights and think they have attained enlightenment. They stop practicing, filled with pride. This is a great error. The displays are merely the path, not the result. Do not be satisfied with mere experiences!

[11881-11905] Others become frightened when they see the empty forms or hear sounds. They run away from the practice, thinking they have gone mad. This too is delusion. These displays are your own mind—there is nothing to fear.

[11906-11930] Some cling to the blissful experiences, wanting them to continue forever. When they fade, they become depressed. This is attachment to samsara, even within the path of liberation. All experiences are impermanent—even the bliss of meditation.

[11931-11955] The wise practitioner rests in the nature of whatever arises, without accepting or rejecting. Good experiences, bad experiences—all are equally the display of rigpa. This is the supreme conduct.

Emaho!
