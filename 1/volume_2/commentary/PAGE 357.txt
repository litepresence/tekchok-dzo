Listen! Refuge going. Womb door bad, turning back. Good choosing.

From Golden Rosary: "Confusion existence's mere aspect. Self-appearance natureless appearing. Self-appearance natureless knowing. Emanation remembering self-liberated." Thus.

Second, extensive explanation has twenty: Circling manner. Definition. Characteristics. Clairvoyance. Miracles. Life measure. Color. Head's looking way. Karma accumulating not accumulating's difference. Karma's signs. Name's enumerations. Body's measure. Birth place identifying. Activity's difference. Light's measure. Karma connection's difference. Next body and afflictions' connection manner. Three realms which included's difference. Next womb entering signs. Example near indication.

First, circling manner's difference: This door not seen or seen yet not confident and not taken into experience ones, for suchness bardo short. Self-appearance not recognizing, existence bardo again and again distracted. Flesh-blood self-grasping form non-existent, yet formerly body self-grasping habituated latency, dream body-like, all faculties complete, flesh form flawless existing-existing-like appearance arising. Former arisen existence's flesh form possessor. All faculties complete, unobstructed possessing. Same class divine eye pure seeing. Irreversible, that is smell-eater. Thus aspect labeled, explained. Flesh form and faculties self-characteristic existing, body taken, actually become, bardo and contradictory.

Therefore, arising basis mark-possessing body free, mind's existence name and four elements seed-aspect depending, body entering near, illusory body name two-possessing. Ground not held, karma all moving, circling.

Second, definition: Suchness appearance setting and six families' body actually not taken between appearance, thus intermediate called. That two joined's middle itself identified.

Emaho! Twenty aspects of the bardo! Longchenpa is being thorough so you have no doubt. The key points: you have clairvoyance but limited control, you're drawn by karma and attachment, and you don't recognize your own nature. But remember—all of this is appearance, empty, natureless. Recognize that, and you're free!
