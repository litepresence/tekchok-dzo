Listen! The early masters said: "Not the result"—but what did they mean? They were freeing us from extreme attachment to the three kayas as truly existent results. Or they were refuting those who hold the three cycles as ultimate. Having removed these contradictions, they also established it as result in reality. But those who don't understand the essence of primordially pure internal expanse as the nature—this is a great error, not good!

Emaho! See the skill of Longchenpa! He's showing how earlier masters used skillful means. When they said "not result," they weren't denying Buddhahood—they were protecting us from grasping. Like telling a child "don't touch the stove"—the stove exists, but the warning prevents harm. The three kayas are both path-appearance AND result—there's no contradiction!

Here, as previously accepted, path-appearance exists, and it doesn't contradict being result. First, it is path-appearance—from the spontaneously accomplished womb of great primordial purity, like entering a house of ultimate result, then emerging from there, needing to appear externally from the primordially pure ground. The mode of appearance appears as abiding-essence-body.

There are two path-appearances: those making oneself Buddha before the result, and having made oneself Buddha, the path of guiding trainees through manifest body accomplishing benefit. From this, here we hold the no-more-learning path-appearance as the three kayas being path-appearance AND being result—non-contradictory, connected meaning.

Don't you see? The path and result aren't separate events in time—they're different aspects of the same recognition. Like a mirror reflecting: the reflection is both the appearing (path) and the complete image (result) simultaneously!

The liberated Dharmakaya internal expanse, the three kayas appearing externally as path-appearance—body and pristine awareness display appearing, Dharmakaya as mind of pristine awareness, Sambhogakaya as its body, Nirmanakaya as appearing activity, producing benefit. This too is internal-clear ground-appearance body and pristine awareness, non-dual, non-separated Vajrasattva suchness, and from that externally clear, the three kayas' path-appearance self-arising—though similar in awareness state, internal-external distinction divided. From self-appearance aspect, in trainees' appearance field, Sambhogakaya-Nirmanakaya appearing, accomplishing benefit, though one as awareness-play, self-appearance not seen by trainees, but that which appears from it is seen—this distinction shows the two similar ones differentiated.

This is subtle! Your own awareness displays everything, but you don't see it as your own display—you see it as "external world." Like watching a movie and forgetting it's just light on a screen. The play of your own rigpa appears as samsara and nirvana, but until you recognize it, it seems like "real world out there." Recognition changes nothing in the display—only in how you understand it!
