Listen! You want to know about these four wisdoms? Don't think they're somewhere up in the sky. Increase, attain, near-attain, moment—these aren't levels you climb like a ladder. They're how your own awareness reveals itself when you stop blocking it. One moment, two, three, four—they arise complete, not piece by piece. Like the sun appearing from behind clouds: was it ever not there?

[3395-3396]
Pay attention here! This is crucial. If you've practiced with the clear light before—if you've become familiar with your own nature—then when that clear light appears in the bardo, you recognize it. Mother clear light, child clear light—they mix inseparably. In one moment, you're transparent in the dharmakaya, pure from the beginning. See? Liberation isn't something you work toward; it's recognizing what already is.

[3397-3399]
But what if you don't recognize? Then you wander into the bardo of existence, taking an illusory body as a yidam deity. Even then, liberation is possible! And if not then, the momentum of good practice continues. You'll meet the supreme dharma in a future life and certainly liberate. So don't despair—practice now plants seeds that never rot.

[3400-3403]
Hear what the Mayajala tantra says: Even if you don't get liberated this very birth, you'll obtain liberation in another existence. The path doesn't abandon you. Your recognition, however small, becomes the seed of awakening.

[3404-3414]
Even the common paths say this: those with faith in suchness will liberate in the future. The Four Hundred Verses confirm it—knowing suchness here, even without obtaining nirvana in this life, you'll effortlessly obtain it in another birth. This is how things work. The Mahayana samadhi teachings are complete.

[3415-3420]
Now Longchenpa turns to the Sugata's intention—the very mind of the buddhas. Rangshar says: Know the sky's expanse. Become familiar with that. Wisdom appearance arises spontaneously. The correct path is just this.

[3421-3426]
Extensively explained: upon the union of sun and moon, two aspects of the Sugata's intention appear. Without modifying anything, sensations cease. Without meditating, just looking—you obtain the measure of warmth. Like ice melting in water, effort dissolves into naturalness.

[3427-3431]
This is the great samadhi where meditation and post-meditation have no boundary—like a river flowing without gaps. Distracted or not distracted, you're continuous space. Daytime and nighttime unite; samsara becomes the path. Daytime is the transcendence aspect, nighttime is the samsara aspect—both are your own mind's display.

Emaho! Day and night are not two!
