Awareness measure-arriving vision arises. Though awareness vision arrives at measure, if not changing from that to other, not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit, not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit from actual vision-mark dharmas. Vision-experience dissolves into base; subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases; experience dharmata exhaustion, dharmata-exhausting vision arises.

First two—nirmanakaya; measure-arriving—sambhogakaya; exhausting—dharmakaya vision. Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn, arrive at fruit dharmata-exhausting pure dhatu. Self-vision potency dissolves into three-bodies' awareness mode; awareness pure fruit, originally from awareness dhatu, self-potency three-bodies dawn, called functioning fruit. Vehicle other: name also not hear essence; vehicle king: called intent. This main point: difficult to realize, is one.

Second: extensively explain individual nature, four are: dharmata direct, experience increasing above, awareness measure-arriving, dharmata exhaust vision. First two: general direct connection place, identify self-characteristic. General direct—conventional term famous direct and ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—two from. Sense-power direct: form etcetera, object five, vision nature. Mind direct: object near enjoy, cause certain, conceptuality object in vision. Self-awareness direct: within pleasure pain etcetera experience called vision. Yogin's direct itself: meaning near meet, actual point enter, particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state, grasp-hold-separate experience certainty.

Emaho! Four visions, three bodies, one awareness—don't complicate what is simple!
