The scriptural treasure! Showing this Dzogchen path is supreme among all vehicles.

Outer: Prajnaparamita—six perfections accomplished through cause-effect. Three reasons Dzogchen surpasses: benefit to countless beings, equals Buddha's speech, natural great emanations, omniscient wisdom. Perfecting six perfections causes the paramitas to self-liberate—unlike gradual path where they take eons.

Middle: Madhyamaka—two truths, four extremes. Three reasons superior: non-object emptiness, emptiness of meaningful existence, clarity through birthlessness, having conduct's ripening method.

Inner: Yogacarya—path of unity and mantra. Two reasons superior: not exhausted in cause-effect, not obtained through birthlessness, quick realization through reliance on path.

Secret: Vajrayana—mandala circles of ground sutras and tantras. Two reasons superior: direct blessing transmission from ground path, through samaya维系 making base. This explains all vehicles—Buddhas taught three times with three vehicles each time, but scriptural treasure teaches the path that reveals all three to one.

Emaho! Outer, middle, inner, secret—one treasure!
