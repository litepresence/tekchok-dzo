Listen! When experience passes beyond sorrow, byung tshor's door also self-self-ceases. Heat and signs self-dissolved, when passing beyond sorrow, afflictions self-dissolved, emptied. Person practicing this exhaustion dharma, developed and self-completed. Whoever sees this essence-abiding capable person, this is Samantabhadra's essence—own nature of all Buddhas' result. Whoever becomes familiar with all Buddhas' result, becomes glorious Vajra holder. First protector, stainless pure, from light womb self-arisen, all Buddhas' activity nature, obtains great secret supreme body. From that non-reversing, yogi with intelligence and power, capable, reaching all result's extent, equal to Samantabhadra. Thus.

Such primordially pure own face, free from existence-nonexistence extremes, body and pristine awareness appearance transcending existence-nonexistence. Ground-appearance merely non-ceased—like crystal own face, light and color nowhere established. From that state, five lights' ground-appearance non-ceased.

From Thal 'gyur: "Though result cannot be expressed, dharmas reaching exhaustion place, own establishment's extreme also destroyed. At this time, lama's pith instruction hidden. View-meditation-action's extremes empty, dharma appearance non-existent. Body and pristine awareness continuity cut. No Buddha, no sentient being. Briefly, nothing abiding. Without going, no coming." Thus.

From Six Expanses: "Thus in suchness primordially pure, no pristine awareness, no body either. Without light, free from colors. Essence nowhere established, ignorance and afflictions—what need to mention? Non-existent." Thus.

Thus internal expanse primordially pure nature, only ground-appearance...

Emaho! This is the radical Dzogchen view! At the ultimate level, even Buddha and sentient beings are not established. Not nihilism—it's the freedom from all concepts, all grasping. The path exhausts itself, like a fire exhausting its fuel. What's left? The natural state, beyond description!
