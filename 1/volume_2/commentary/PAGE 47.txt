Like snow falling on rock salt—on top of the appearance itself, self-liberation goes spontaneously, instantly. That also: arising appearance, ceasing appearance, coming and going appearance, and so forth—training in phenomena as different pieces, grasping and attachment liberated. Although appearing, empty of truth—like reflections, water-moon, sound-echo, emanations, illusions, mirages, optical illusions, like a dream horse completely pure.

Listen to this! Longchenpa gives you eight metaphors for how appearances are: like snow on rock salt, like reflections in a mirror, like the moon in water, like echoes, like magical emanations, like illusions created by a magician, like a mirage, like optical illusions, like a dream. What do all these have in common?

They appear, but they're not real! The reflection appears, but you can't drink it. The echo sounds, but has no source. The dream horse seems completely real while you're dreaming, but leaves no trace when you wake. This is how all phenomena are—they appear, vividly, but they're empty of inherent existence.

The practice is to see this directly. When appearances arise, let them self-liberate instantly, like snow falling on salt and dissolving immediately. Don't try to stop appearances. Don't try to maintain them. Just let them arise and cease naturally, seeing their empty nature.

Training in dharmata's unborn nature, the general form of dharmas, realizing peaceful from the primordial like space.

This is the view. All dharmas—all phenomena—are unborn. They never truly came into existence. They're peaceful from the very beginning, like space itself. Space has no center, no edge, no coming or going. In the same way, the nature of mind is unborn, peaceful, completely open.

From the Six Vastnesses:

In the mind-itself where arising exists,
By self-dawning of six-realms' appearances,
Different forms are grasped,
Appearance matures complete as form.

In the mind-itself where ceasing exists,
By self-dawning as impermanent cause,
In appearances without nature,
Complete like a dream.

In the mind-itself where elaboration exists,
By self-dawning of various appearances,
In individual appearances of five gates,
Complete on the ground of grasping self-ground.

In the mind-itself where showing exists,
By self-dawning of sounds, words, names,
Concepts and minds self-pure,
Guru's secret instruction complete.

This is the Six Vastnesses tantra, pointing to how everything arises from mind. The six realms appear from mind. Forms appear from mind. Impermanence appears from mind. Concepts appear from mind. Everything is the self-dawning of mind's nature.

But notice: it says the appearances are grasped, that they mature complete as form, that they're like a dream, that they're complete on the ground of grasping. This is describing how the whole world appears—vividly, completely—yet it's all mind. The grasping creates the solidity, but the nature remains pure.

The guru's secret instruction is this: concepts and minds are self-pure. You don't need to purify them. You don't need to transform them. They're already pure from the beginning. Just recognize this!

Don't think these are just poetic descriptions. This is pointing to your actual experience. Right now, as you read these words, the appearance is vivid. But where is it? In your mind. And what is your mind? Unborn, peaceful, like space. This is the nature of your present experience.

Emaho! All appearances are the play of your own mind, like reflections in a mirror.
