Second, dissolving into pristine awareness expanse: Five afflictions purified as five pristine awarenesses' five self-radiances dissolving into internal expanse luminous clarity, abiding as ground-appearance of five clear depth colors. From Six Expanses: "Self-radiance moved, white aspect, abiding as great clear depth itself. Appearance self-dissolved, yellow aspect, unmanifest from depth, own face clear. Attachment-aversion self-dissolved, red aspect, clear depth unmixed, abiding greatly. Effort accomplishment movement self-freed, inexhaustible green, also first rays, unmanifest from depth, clear aspect. Unchanging perfection dark blue, primordially perfect, without making, abides." Thus.

Emaho! This is the completion of the alchemical process! The five afflictions—ignorance, attachment, aversion, pride, jealousy—transform into the five wisdoms. Not destroyed, not rejected—transformed through recognition! Like base metal becoming gold through alchemical process. Your confusion becomes wisdom when you recognize its true nature!

These too: Powerful Lady, Holding Dynamic Lady, Elevating Lady, Stable Lady, Appearing Making Lady. From these five: Water-pure nature, downward-clearing Powerful Lady, joins main-circle non-dual with pristine awareness wind, actually without division. Wind-pure nature, upward-moving Holding Dynamic, moves five main-circles in Dharmakaya state in an instant. Earth-pure nature, pervading ground-appearance aspect abiding Elevating Lady, without support-supported, abides as form body in Dharmakaya state. Appearing Making Lady, space-pure nature, non-existent equal four appearances' Dharmakaya and pristine awareness actually non-existent, abiding as internally clear in clear depth ground-appearance aspect. Stable Lady, earth-pure nature, life wind ground-appearance aspect, makes awareness pristine awareness non-conceiving intent unmoving from...

This is subtle body completion! The five winds, the five elements—all purified into the five wisdoms. The body becomes the mandala, the channels become wisdom's path. Don't make it complicated—it's the recognition that your physical body is the display of wisdom!
