Longchenpa continues the detailed correspondences—everything in the universe is in your body. Music and canopies, banners and upper-canopies—all these appearing dharmas are complete in the yogi's body.

Here are the specific correspondences:
- Earth's portion: flesh (the solid substance)
- Water's portion: blood (gathering, flowing)
- Fire's portion: warmth (ripening, maturing)
- Wind's portion: breath (karmic vehicle)
- Space's portion: mind (awareness itself)
- Sun-moon: the two eyes (clarity, perception)
- Male: birth (active principle)
- Female: death (receptive dissolution)
- Planets: the gate-house of desire and two nostrils (openings)
- Stars: teeth (sparkling, distinct)
- Clouds: hair (covering, floating)
- Trees: channels (branching pathways)
- Mountains: the whole similar body (solid, upright)
- Rocks: bones (hard structure)
- Tree roots: heart (foundation)
- Trunk: legs (support)
- Branches: limbs (extensions)
- Flowers: five faculties (senses blooming)
- Fruit: happiness-suffering of body (result)
- Sound: voice (expression)
- Form: body (appearance)
- Smell: pores (openings)
- Taste: skin (surface contact)
- Touch: sickness (sensation)
- Music: internal organs (harmony)
- Canopy: urine (fluid covering)
- Parasol: legs (protection)
- Banner: name (identity)
- Upper-canopy: breath (covering atmosphere)

This isn't symbolic—it's actual structure. Your body literally IS the universe in concentrated form. The Mutik Trengwa verse confirms all this.

Second: completeness in mind. All dharmas of samsara-nirvana, base and path, are completely present in mind. From the same source:

All white dharmas of transcendence are completely present in body and mind. Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence, they're also present. The list includes everything: mandala, deity, offering, mantra, mudra, concentration, empowerment, samaya, instruction, experience, development stage, hearing, contemplating, meditating, view, conduct, giving, ethics, patience, effort, concentration, wisdom, powers, aspiration, perfections, ten virtues, method and wisdom—all are present in body and mind.

This is the completion stage view: you don't need to go somewhere else to find these. They're already complete in your own body and mind.
