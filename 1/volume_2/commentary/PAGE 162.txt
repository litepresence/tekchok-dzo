The ocean of just-place carries intention without trying. Not appearance, yet appearances arise. Not empty, yet not existing as emptiness. Not clear, yet clarity itself. Not dull, yet excitement never stirs. Unmoved, unmoving, beyond all movement. The great method of place isn't made—it just is. Not making send and receive, not grasping or rejecting.

Not dwelling anywhere, not transcending anything—ocean-like primordial wisdom, vast and spontaneous, unmoved in space. From ocean depths impossible to measure, see the peak of victory never setting. Empty mind, great body unmade. By not-making, conquer all making. Primordially unarisen, unmade, just this.

Dharmata dwelling in sky—intention shown. Dharmakaya, primordial wisdom—thought completely abandoned. If no movement, no making, that's the intention of meditation.

When not grasping at appearances or their directions, like stars dawning in ocean depths, clarity never ceases. That's how self-arisen intention dwells.

Identify the naked burst of clear-empty awareness—wide wide wide self-clarity. Cut the mistake-place of samadhi-grasping. From within, copper-shining dharmakaya dawns.

Looking outward at self-knowing objects, great thought-free dharmakaya found within.

When gazing at outer appearances, place in the self-clarity dawning from within. Looking outward at awareness-clarity dharmata, see awareness free from all divisions.

Rest there. The rest has no further instructions.
