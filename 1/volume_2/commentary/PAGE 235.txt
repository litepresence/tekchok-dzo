Look here, precious one! The space introduction has five aspects [10011-10110]! Through wisdom wind-moved space-appearance, you are introduced! Through the five families' surface appearance, space wisdom is introduced!

Like a net hanging half-way, the measureless palace is introduced! Through raising mirrors in the four window directions center and five, the five families' appearance light demonstrates the expanse body!

Like raising a flower cluster of five in a water-filled vessel, the expanse cluster is introduced - these seven! At introduction time, make offerings, arrange excellent materials, prepare clothing and dwelling!

The Introduction Ornament Tantra says: Look at your own nature, suitable vessel disciple! In a dwelling place half-open, with sun ray holes, raise a clear mirror! See the five lights arise outside!

Place intelligence at the eye's top, see self-light clear outside! Look at each other from left corners, see the connecting thread-ray appearance! Or place light at eye's top, look at one another - see the three bodies connected as one method!

Look at butter-lamp essence with itself - meet primordial wisdom clear light's nature! Place two mirrors at colored pigment edge - with intelligent eye method supreme, look! Meet the mother-child measures of rigpa, know the dharmata mother measures!

Emaho!
