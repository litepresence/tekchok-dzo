Listen! Astonished and amazed, born into emanation body's field realms, merely so it is said. These too, from Bhagavan Vajra Holder's blessings, naturally arranged, therefore called "nature emanation fields." Those fields' continuities—from heart's mirror-like etc., pristine awareness jewel self-clear self-radiance, and in skull house, wrathful mandala, primordially abiding appearance, arise. Appearance to retinue, faculties' objects seen capable cause, and liberation certain cause, should be known as that.

### From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
From Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod: "Faculties' end ones, nature emanation body field, exhaling breath—twenty-fourth chapter." Having extensively explained ground and path stages of Secret Supreme certain liberation through crucial points, now ascertaining where accomplished by that method, perfected ultimate result stage in two: General presentation of manifestly awakening in internal expanse primordially pure ground. Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance.

First has three: Held by liberation place's essence. Explained separately nature of how liberated. Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. First: Self-arisen awareness naturally pure, pure by all adventitious stains, two purities possessed Dharmakaya, non-dual expanse and pristine awareness primordially pure jewel secret womb is ultimate liberation place.

From Self-Arising Awareness: "Liberation place is primordially pure appearance. Like vase body example." "All Buddhas' deliverance place is primordially pure great mandala." From Jewel Heap: "Result Dharmakaya emptiness, entities exhausted, very wonderful."

This is the completion ground! Every being has this nature—just obscured. Liberation isn't going somewhere else—it's recognizing what's always been. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life!
