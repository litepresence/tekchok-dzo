Fourth, the extensive explanation of enumerations—from the five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity.

Kaya: appearing as whatever form beings believe in, each one's portion, marks and signs complete.

Speech: sixty branches' melodious sound, well-connected.

Mind: knowing how things are and how many, expansive.

Qualities: all dharmas of powers and so forth, knowing perfectly complete.

Enlightened activity: turning the Dharma wheel of five perfections, nature of outer, inner, secret three.

From the Thalgyur:

"Nirmanakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects.

Kaya marks and signs,
Whatever trainees arise, body emanation.

Speech word-connection good,
Brahma's expanse sixty branches.

Mind by wisdom of knowables,
Abiding in intention of twofold benefit.

Qualities knowing perfectly complete,
Enlightened activity outer, inner, secret,
All activities perfectly complete,
Abide as five perfections."

This is the complete description of enlightened manifestation—not just form, but speech, mind, qualities, and activity. All five are spontaneously present, naturally complete.

Outer five perfections:
- Perfect place: Vulture Peak Mountain
- Perfect teacher: Shakyamuni
- Perfect Dharma: various vehicles
- Perfect retinue: common and uncommon
- Perfect time: at the time of hundred-year lifespan

Inner five perfections:
- Perfect place: Akanistha
- Perfect teacher: Vajradhara
- Perfect retinue: dakinis, siddhas, bodhisattvas
- Perfect Dharma: secret mantra outer and inner dharmas
- Perfect time: time of conditions, karma, and fortune meeting

Secret five perfections:
- Perfect place: charnel ground, blazing fire mountain
- Perfect teacher: Youthful Hero Powerful
- Perfect retinue: dakinis and so forth

These describe the three levels of teaching: outer (sutra), inner (tantra), and secret (dzogchen). Each has its own context, its own teacher form, its own audience, its own Dharma, its own timing.

The key insight: the Buddha doesn't just teach one way. The teaching appears according to what's needed, where it's needed, when it's needed. This is the skillful means of enlightenment.

But don't get confused thinking these are separate teachings. They're all the same wisdom, appearing in different forms for different capacities. The essence is always the same—recognize your own nature!

Emaho! Five perfections, three levels, one wisdom!
