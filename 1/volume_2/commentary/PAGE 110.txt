Listen here! Lu like good water vessel, water increase-decrease not emerging, body and wisdom increase-gate various, path-vision until complete, from that emerges! Gu that within dharmata not-reversed view and meditation pulls!

Rgyud samsara-nirvana pervading, vision that gathering from, body and thigle radiating, melting, gathering etc., clear! From Spontaneous Liberation: "Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish, from that vision four become! Dharmata direct vision, intellect holding view destroy! Experience vision above increase, delusion vision ceases!"

Emaho! Lu-gu-rgyud of the four visions!

This is the direct path of the Great Perfection! No gradual stages, no elaborate practices—just recognition of what is already present!

Emaho! Direct liberation!
