Lu: like good water channel, water emerges without increase or decrease. Body and wisdom increase-opening, various path-visions until complete, from that dawning cause. Gu: inside that, pull not-mistaken dharmata view and meditation. Rgyud: pervading samsara-nirvana, from those vision collections, body and point radiating and arising and gathering, clear cause. From Thalgyur: slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom; from that, vision becomes four.

By dharmata direct vision, suppress intellect-grasping view. By experience-vision increasing above, cause delusion vision to cease. By awareness measure-arriving vision, transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision. By dharmata exhausting vision, cut three-realms' samsara stream. Vision four number determined: outer sun-moon time four, increase decrease; inner body speech mind four, liberating from binding; secret empowerment four determination; actual four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.

Sequence determined: first, base dharmata direct not see, remaining three dawning base not existing—basis and supported base, first dharmata direct vision dawning. That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning, called self-arisen wisdom self-found. Then direct that, if not experience experience, word only, fruit not arise. Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise. Need make firm arisen experience measure. If not firm, experience no end, not possessing dharmas, buddha not arising. Arrive at firm experience measure cause.

Emaho! Four visions like four seasons—each must ripen in its time!
