Listen here, you who fear death! Longchenpa explains something profound: the four rivers - birth, aging, sickness, death - flow to exhaustion and cessation. But this isn't some philosophical theory! This is your direct experience, happening right now.

Look at the outer container disintegrating. "World exhausted, basis-place not-existing" - When the universe itself winds down, where can samsara continue? The cosmic show is ending, but you're still chasing appearances! The outer world ceases - this isn't apocalypse, it's the natural exhaustion of phenomena.

Now the inner sentient beings: "life span upward-growing, downward-decreasing" - This describes how beings mature then decline. But Longchenpa is pointing to something deeper: when outer container ceases, inner beings naturally exhaust too. If one doesn't happen, the other can't complete.

"These if not exhausted, self three realms not liberated!" - This is crucial! You can't achieve individual liberation while the cosmic support system remains active. The three realms continue because the conditions supporting them persist.

Now the profound teaching: "outer container's world exhausted, basis-place not-existing" - When the universe dissolves into emptiness, there's no ground to stand on. "Returning place not-existing" - Nowhere to go back to! "Main point" - This is the key realization!

"Inner sentient beings exhausted, birth-continuity ceased, awareness itself death free." When your own life-force exhausts naturally, without clinging or fear, recognition liberates you from death itself. Not that you don't die - you recognize death as exhaustion into dharmata!

"Then vision whatever's essence established not" - Whatever visionary experiences arise, they all establish in the same essential nature. This isn't hard to say - it's the simplest truth! "Dharmata exhaustion called, meaning's fruit!" - The complete exhaustion of all phenomena into their essential nature.

"Fruit is person this is not hard to say, mind's measure not!" - Don't measure your progress with concepts! "Dharmata exhaustion is measure-arrived time" - When all phenomena have exhausted into their nature, that's the time of completion.

Emaho! The exhaustion of dharmas isn't destruction - it's them coming home to rest!
