From Blazing Lamp: dhatu makes awareness's self-field; vajra itself is hanging-cord; make place this inside. Fruit is: when outer dhatu-vision, eye not moving, self time; inner: awareness abiding in base, cause resonance to dissolve from self, circle; separate lung wind horse cause; wisdom sky dissolves into dhatu sky, cause equal limitless liberation; pure awareness, not moving in dhatu, abides in nature of luminous-clear intent, heart-in mode. That yogin: called capturing original dharmata luminous-clear, from samsara name empty, three-realms corpse cut is.

From Thalgyur: that dharmata direct main-point: know by seeing only, and realize by that knowing, become liberate by realizing only. Liberate called: not untie. Sky in sky, dissolve nature not-aim cause, equal limitless, not possessing part. Capacity-possess find direct: three-realms samsara name empty cause, three-realms corpse cut.

From Thalgyur: experience vision increasing above is: from wisdom color outer emerge, up-stand and wing dawn, various points, body itself, clear in coarse vision field.

Emaho! Three realms' corpse cut—who is the corpse? Look!
