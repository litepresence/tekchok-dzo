Listen here, you who wonder about the view of dharmata! Longchenpa explains something profound about how rigpa relates to phenomena - and you might get lost in philosophy!

"Dharmata not-objectified dharmata is not phenomena: Phenomena not dharmata is not Dzogchen." These lines destroy your intellectual tendency to make categories! Don't you see? Longchenpa is saying: When you try to define dharmata as objects, you're already wrong. When you call phenomena "dharmata," you're confusing levels!

"Dharmata not-objectified: Phenomena not dharmata's not-objectification: dharmata empty but phenomena not-empty - not Dzogchen." This is even more subtle! You might think "Dzogchen says phenomena don't exist." But that's nihilism! Longchenpa says dharmata is empty - but appearing phenomena aren't empty in the same way!

"Not-objectification" means don't reify appearances as things! They appear, but not as solid objects with independent existence.

Now listen to the crucial error: "Appearance-only ultimate: appearance-only ultimate, emptiness-only ultimate - not Dzogchen." This is exactly what philosophy does! It splits reality into two camps - appearance vs emptiness, eternalism vs nihilism. Longchenpa says this dualistic thinking misses the point entirely!

"Appearance-only ultimate: appearance-only ultimate" means treating appearances as ultimately real. "Emptiness-only ultimate" means treating emptiness as some separate truth. Both are conceptual boxes that Dzogchen transcends!

"Not-objectification: appearance and emptiness inseparable" - This is the revolutionary teaching! When you try to define either appearance or emptiness as ultimate, you miss their inseparability. Like trying to separate water from wetness!

Emaho! Stop philosophizing and just recognize the inseparability of appearance and emptiness!
