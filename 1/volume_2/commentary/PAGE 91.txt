[4132-4143]
From Dzogchen: "What virtue accomplishes through many eons, my dzogchen spontaneously accomplishes in an instant." The supreme vehicle's speed—pith understanding, practice maturation, obstacles removed at arrival—unlike lesser vehicles where three incalculable eons needed.

From Ati's approach: "If not outside knowledge of Abhidharma, can't give three vows." Dzogchen beyond all knowledge-extremes—outside knowledge's dominion.

Two divisions: View development stage and practice perfection stage. First's method: seeing.view, hearing.view, wearing.view—developing respective capacities, primordially not created.

Second's method: initial and main practice sequence. Initially three emphasis: joining, receiving, learning—they join themselves with guru's speech, apply to Dakini's song; receive instructions of vital points; learn from guru's oral teaching with thanks. Main practice five excellencees—unlike previous methods—has four.

Emaho! Instant maturation in an instant!
