Listen here, you who think Dzogchen is complicated philosophy! Longchenpa now addresses your intellectual tendency to create contradictions where none exist. He's about to smash your conceptual thinking with simple, direct truth!

"Fruit's primordial purity without body and wisdom—heart-essence misreading arises!" Do you understand what this means? You try to separate primordial purity (*ka dag*) from its natural expressions - body and wisdom. But Longchenpa says they're inseparable! Like trying to separate fire from heat!

"Outer appearance resonance body and wisdom crystal-light inwardly returned like portion, thus said, meaning not understood merely!" Oh, how students love to analyze! You think Longchenpa is giving complex doctrinal points. But he's saying: When you over-intellectualize, you miss the direct experience!

"Actually, inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence; uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished contradicts..." Longchenpa is listing all the logical contradictions you create when you try to understand primordial purity through concepts!

[5525-5540]
Such contradictions - listen carefully! "Uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished" - this is what happens when you think time is linear! "Inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence" - this happens when you separate ground from path!

But here's the crucial point: Longchenpa says "Such faults accepting not suitable!" Why? Because these aren't real intellectual problems to be solved - they're symptoms of conceptual mind trying to grasp what's beyond concepts!

[5541-5548]
Now, after destroying your intellectual errors, the master gives the actual teaching: "Fifth boundary: measure-arrived curtain from exhaustion beginning time, own four legs' fingers light five clear merely existing..."

This isn't some complex visualization technique! The "measure-arrived curtain" isn't something to practice - it's the natural display when awareness recognizes its own completeness. The "four legs' fingers light" aren't special powers - they're how your innate capacity expresses itself!

Emaho! Stop trying to understand primordial purity and just recognize it directly!
