Listen here, you fortunate ones! The text reveals how the mandala of the five Buddha families unfolds within the heart center. Like a master craftsman arranging precious jewels, the deities appear in perfect symmetry—Maitreya and the eight bodhisattvas in the eight directions, the eight goddesses of delight, and the guardians of the gates. Each Buddha sits upon a throne of lions, elephants, horses, peacocks, and garudas [13666-13669], radiant as sun and moon upon lotus seats in vajra posture.

You must understand—though your physical body seems absent at this time, the imprint of self-grasping still lingers like a dream [13684]. The light body manifests from the habitual tendencies not yet exhausted. What appears as external light is actually your own display, like reflections in a mirror. Do you see? The light rays streaming from the heart bind you to these visions through the connection of your own radiance [13687-13688].

This is the stage where recognition is everything. The deities appear not as external gods to be worshipped, but as the play of your own awareness. If you recognize this, you are liberated. If not, you wander further into confusion.

Emaho!
