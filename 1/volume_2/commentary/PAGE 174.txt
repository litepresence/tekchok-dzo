Without break, vast openness, placing time-free three times' pure intention in great river depth—oral instruction of self-clear own-place expanse.

First: adjusting body key and wind key, placing awareness self-clear appearance self-appearance without grasping-grasped—loosely!

From Sixth Treasury: "Suchness uncontrived, like sky unclouded. Self-dawn self-clear portion. Thus in clear sky, like sun's essence self-appearing. Nature stainless body. One gathered definite essence—this is my mandala!"

[7371-7394]
Second: practicing with ten great methods cutting time-three's mind connection:

From same text: "One who doesn't follow past's trace, doesn't project future's hope, places present awareness in own place—all awareness without before-after mixes as one. One-gathered one nature called yogin of time-three equality."

Not tracing past's latencies. Not welcoming future's latencies. Not abiding present's latencies in stream.

By self-liberated memory method, mixing samsara-nirvana as nondual: cutting past memories' interval, pressing down future memories' head, letting present memories self-dissolve.

Not aiming at past mind. Not turning back to future mind. Not placing attention on present mind.

Not sending ransoms to past ignorance. Not casting fathers to future ignorance. Not taking present ignorance in lap.

Emaho! Cut all ties to the three times!
