Look here, devoted practitioner! Second, the inner body measure: when body dust purifies, from heart center white A, light-rays five coil like sun-reflection in intermediate-space, star-window inside dawn pierces [5302]. From crown uspa, wisdom wind abides, nature lifts vision [5303]. From urna, light-ray five fathoms, one light clear [5304]. Hand finger five-to, light five garland coil [5305].

See! Body hair-door etc., outer-inner part dust-particle scope, small each land realms number-not-exist, Buddha and beings measure-not-exist vision, spontaneously-accomplish door eight dawn vision, all here exceed lack not, self-vision-to vision [5306]! Crown-palate wrathful mandala and heart peaceful mandala [5307], body part all-to nature emanation, train-beings emanation, various emanation vision-through Buddha field-in self-vision beings benefit do vision [5308-5310].

Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets, dharma all know wisdom dawns [5311-5312]. Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure, self-vision sambhogakaya complete, mind defilement pure, dust doubt separation itself obtains [5313-5314]. Ground and ground latencies self-pure, the Thalgyur declares [5315].

Measure-arrive body also thus becomes [5316], individual body dust free-from, intermediate-space light star-window vision [5317-5318]. Then light-ray hook shape, subtle and coil-through vision hold [5319-5320]. Body dust self-ceases, copper-shining stainless light body [5321-5322]. Center A mark, urna light-ray fathom one measure [5323-5324], crown-uspa wind-by lift vision [5325].

Peaceful-body hand finger from light garland form coil [5326-5327], sound-not mind activity [5328], head skull palace heruka manifest arises [5329-5330]. This time self-body measure-to arrives, copper-shining body three one coil [5331-5333].

Third, secret awareness measure: subtle coarse move mind pure although, all-ground consciousness only mind exists [5334-5336]. Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawns [5337] - this itself from!

Thus practitioner, your body is the mandala, your mind is the wisdom! Emaho!
