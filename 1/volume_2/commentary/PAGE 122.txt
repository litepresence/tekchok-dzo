From the Thal 'gyur: The measure of completion having thus arrived—direct objective visions cease, the vision of earth and stones melts away, self-knowing enters into everything, inert things move when directed, the measure of wind's movement is grasped, the body's dust-particles become visible. Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies, from that fathers and mothers embrace, the five and five fathers and mothers unite, all within the round periphery—the yogin's body also luminous, appearing to go, come, and sit. All is awareness arriving at its measure.

Second: Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A, five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space. Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted. From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly. Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil. Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.

In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala. In all parts of the body, natural emanations, emanations taming beings, various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields. Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and the wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn. Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya. The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt, the latencies of ground and grounds self-purify.

Emaho! Dust-particles containing universes—your body is infinite!
