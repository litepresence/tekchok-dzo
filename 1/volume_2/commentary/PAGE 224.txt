Listen well, fortunate one! The five lights appear outwardly to the eye, yet their nature is clear light from within [9585-9616]! Like white light demonstrating compassion inseparable from itself - this is how the three kayas abide as one bindu!

Look here! When sunlight strikes a crystal, rays extend outward, yet the light arises from the crystal itself. So too does base-appearances arise from the base - but because of non-recognition, ignorance arises as knowable obscuration!

Samantabhadra transcends the base through wisdom's sense power! In a single moment, distinctions separate; in a single moment, complete Buddhahood! Before all Buddhas, like a great grandfather, already enlightened!

Dear practitioner, understand this: Buddhas without cause, without beginning or end, with a single wisdom eye unstained! The liberation base of Samantabhadra is demonstrated here. When you recognize base-appearance as it arises, you are liberated!

Yet sentient beings do not recognize their own appearances as self-appearances. Like various colored cloths placed over a crystal, like white light appearing as various colors - so does awareness arise as various delusions through the habit-continuum of rising and sleeping!

Do not be confused! These appearances are your own wisdom's display. Recognize them directly, without grasping. Rest in the nature as it is!

Emaho!
