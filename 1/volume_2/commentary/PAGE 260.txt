Listen! In Dzogchen there are two buddhahood modes [11318-11337]: manifest complete buddhahood with signs, light, and material remains; and true complete buddhahood without aggregates' remainder through pure effort.

From the Vajrasattva Mirror Tantra [11338-11411]: these signs—light, sound, relics, kayas, earth-shaking and so forth—manifest for the one achieving manifest buddhahood. This is not ordinary; it is your own nature displaying its power!

The extensive explanation [11412-11425] covers five topics: kayas, relics, light, sound, and earth-shaking. The kaya's essence [11426-11443] is divine appearance—full kayas, half-kayas, father-mother forms, spheres, great mandalas, stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses, and more.

From generation and completion practice [11444-11471], seed syllables, attributes, half-forms appear gradually; full forms appear as couples, spheres, mandalas. Peaceful and wrathful kayas [11472-11482] both manifest—peaceful cannot emanate; wrathful possesses the power to manifest!

The result [11483-11498] is liberation according to sequence: when both peaceful and wrathful arise, consciousness dissolves into space and dharmakaya's self-radiance dawns—liberation without bardo, included in this life's liberation!

Emaho!
