Listen here, you who think Dzogchen has complex systems! Longchenpa quotes three tantras to show one essential point - and you might miss the simplicity!

From the Letterless Tantra: "Unborn direct perception—by buddhas, objectless pure vision seen." This isn't about some special ability only buddhas have! It's describing the natural capacity of mind itself - direct perception without mediation of concepts!

And from the Magical Display: "Jewel Wish-Fulfilling, Desire Glory, all buddhas' direct perception." Do you see? All these expressions point to the same thing - recognizing directly without any interference!

[5003–5015]
From the Jewel Mound Tantra: "Direct means seeing; three means three kayas; arriving certainly in the buddha-field." Listen carefully! "Arriving certainly" doesn't mean traveling somewhere - it's recognizing you're already there! The buddha-field isn't some distant pure land - it's your own awareness when free from conceptual veils!

"The purpose? Through this main point, you liberate without error or obstacle." The liberation Longchenpa speaks of isn't achieved through techniques - it's the natural result of recognizing what has always been true!

[5016–5021]
"As that same text says: 'Without dharmata direct perception's main point, like a blind person going to a cliff.'" Oh, how this shatters your spiritual seeking! You think direct perception is some advanced practice? Longchenpa says it's like a blind person accidentally finding the edge of a cliff - not through skill, but through accident!

This is revolutionary: When conceptual searching stops, direct perception happens naturally, without any special method! You don't need to "develop" it - you just need to stop blocking it with concepts!

Emaho! The main point is just seeing - and you've been seeing all along!

—Patrul Rinpoche, by the cliff edge of conceptual seeking
