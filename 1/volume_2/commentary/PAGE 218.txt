Listen to the descent of wisdom! [9456-9470] Then the thirty-three abodes, Victorious mansion's upper floor, "Potali Kataka" named, descended. Then to Five-Peak Mountain's peak. Then to Vajra Seat. Then to Mount Kailash. Then that great stupa radiated as light-rays, saying "I shall dispel sentient beings' conceptual thoughts." Thus from the first when this world formed, from Vajra Space mandala through natural blessing emanation, Teacher Vajradhara delighted for beings' benefit, descending to Tushita's Joyful Heap's left.

[9471-9494] Through thirty-three, Five-Peak Mountain, Vajra Seat, and Kailash, going for beings' benefit descending one to one, now residing at Kailash's peak in jewel-light-radiating mansion, respected and praised by many dakinis, siddhas, and mantra-holders. Though the actual mirror is absent, for certain symbols, from various jewels or snow and ocean continents, naturally arising crystal should be sought as introduction's mirror. From the Introduction Ornament: "Jewel essence jewel blazing light, or jewel red-blue water-crystal, earth essence jewel eyes unopened, stone essence jewel crystal establishes buddhas' natural state."

[9495-9514] From the Jewel Radiant Display: "Vajrasattva's symbol example is white color moon's hue, examine between darkness and light. Jewel clear light stainless, display possessing five colors. Five bodies not individually distinguished, front and back inseparable. Clear dharmata great light, clear dharmata all-blazing. Lamp-display all's supreme, great emptiness sky-expanse, all display dawns as light. That dawning is not added, none can grasp it. If wisdom eye possessing, like stainless waxing moon, see good mandala. Non-distracted Dzogchen meditation."

Emaho!
