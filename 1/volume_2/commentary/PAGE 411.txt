The qualities that carry to the end, the nirmanakaya guiding beings, connecting to the ultimate dharmakaya. From That Very:

"The essence of qualities produces all,
The definitive terminology of qualities accomplishes various,
Divided, shown as three:
Qualities abiding in the basis,
Qualities appearing in the path,
Qualities carrying to the end."

This is the structure of enlightened qualities—they're not just in the result, they're present throughout: in the ground (basis), on the path, and in the fruition. Don't think you have to wait until you're enlightened to experience Buddha-qualities. They're present right now, in your own nature, if you recognize them!

[17061-17069]
Fifth, regarding enlightened activity also: essence, definitive terminology, division into three. The essence of enlightened activity is benefiting beings, spontaneously accomplishing until samsara is not emptied. From the Abhisamayalankara:

"Likewise, as long as this existence remains,
Activity is asserted to be uninterrupted."

This is crucial! A Buddha's activity doesn't stop. As long as there are beings in samsara, enlightened activity continues spontaneously, effortlessly. It's not that Buddhas "try" to help—helping is their nature, like the sun naturally shines.

[17070-17079]
Definitive terminology: The enlightened activity of the three kayas, acting for trainees, purifying karma and afflictions, connecting to the level of Buddha. Knowing the realm of trainees and latent tendencies, accomplishing their benefit appropriately, without possessing effort or exertion—like the moon's reflection appearing in water.

From the Gyud Lama (Uttaratantra):

"The realm of trainees, the taming action,
Their abode and suchness—
The Lord always spontaneously engages."

This is the nature of Buddha activity—completely natural, completely responsive. Like the moon reflecting in water, it appears without the moon "trying" to reflect. The reflection appears when conditions are present. So too with enlightened activity.

[17080-17095]
Divided into four: From the Rigpa Rangshar Chenpo Gyud:

"Peaceful and expansive,
Likewise powerful and wrathful."

Peaceful activity purifies beings' obscurations and serves as the method for pacifying all suffering, causing the ornament wheel of inexhaustible qualities to arise. Expansive activity increases beings' qualities and fulfills all desires and hopes. Powerful activity harmoniously gathers beings, and through the great river of empowerment ripens the unripened extensively. Wrathful activity cuts through the vicious, presses the three realms into the expanse, and having overwhelmed the three realms, liberates samsara into nirvana, establishing all in the fruition of supreme awakening.

These four activities—peaceful, expansive, powerful, wrathful—are the skillful means by which Buddhas work with beings. Not everyone needs the same medicine. Some need peace, some need expansion, some need empowerment, some need wrathful intervention. The Buddha knows what each being needs and responds appropriately.

This is the completion of the discussion of spontaneous accomplishment. The path is complete. The ground has been explained, the path detailed, the fruition described. Everything is present, complete, spontaneously accomplished.
