Ah, precious disciple! Bardo distinctions [12101-12120]: common and uncommon. Some common vehicles consider birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo, etc. But uncommon Secret Mantra King here distinguishes: nature-abiding bardo, death-point bardo, dharmata bardo, samsara bardo—four.

Appearances' modes [12121-12150]: for three realms generally, afflictions manifest as grasping-fixation. For six realms specifically: gods see nectar in water, humans see water, pretas see pus—one substance, different minds. From Two Truths: "Mind differs, therefore single entity appears as unrealized."

Individual persons [12151-12160]—one person seen as enemy and friend by different people; happiness-suffering, confusion-non-confusion, attachment-aversion, good-bad, dharma-undharma all appear variously. Future karma's good-bad operates through diverse cause-effect.

In short [12161-12180]: whatever appears to anyone is like good-bad various dreams—though appearing, unestablished, they appear in empty clarity. Nature-abiding bardo's appearance [12181-12200]: five aggregates' bondage obscures five kayas' appearance; elements and sense-bases obscure light and color; karma and afflictions obscure wisdom and dharmata.

This is [12201-12220] the four reversals' difficult-to-cross river whirlpool, day-night circling in various karma and habitual patterns.

Emaho!
