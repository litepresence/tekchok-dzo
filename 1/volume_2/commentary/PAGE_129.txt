[5540-5542] Listen here, dear practitioner! This delusion-vision's vision appears like a mirror's reflection. That own body also like water-moon—wisdom illusory body, self-vision zinc-tin, free from elements' harm, vajra body obtained! For sentient beings' benefit, called arising as body of great transference!

[5543-5548] Others' impure eye, from merely stone-with zinc-tin not seen. Great master Vimala and Padma likewise! Then birth and entering, two powers obtained. Even instant Buddha, duration exists. Until samsara not emptied, doing sentient beings' benefit, also freedom power!

[5549-5556] Birth power is: entering dharmadhatu, putting rigpa into three thousand beings, all liberated at one time—great power obtained! Insects also dive into light! Birth power obtained, whatever desired emanated, spontaneously doing sentient beings' benefit!

Do you see? Your body is the vajra body! Not seen by impure eyes, but for those with pure vision—mirror-like, water-moon-like! You have the power of birth and entering. Use it for beings!

Emaho! Vajra body of great transference!
