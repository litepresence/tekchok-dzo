[497-501]
The five fire-equal winds are nondual with:
- Life
- Awareness
- Lamp (of wisdom)
- Bindhu (essence)
- Wisdom

This nonduality is key—they're not separate things but different aspects of the same reality.

[502-512]
Third, the five color-and-radiance-producing winds:
1. Consciousness-producing wind
2. Wind arising from mind
3. Wind possessing radiance
4. Wind of burning
5. Wind of wildness

Their objects:
- Wisdom object
- Appearing object
- Lamp object
- Non-awareness object
- Mind's object (the "horse" that carries mind)

These winds are responsible for the clarity and radiance of consciousness, producing the various cognitions and perceptions.

[513-526]
Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
1. Pervading the base
2. Pervading immediately
3. Pervading hatred and fear
4. Pervading memory
5. Pervading all body by holding

They appear in:
- Wisdom
- Lamp
- Knowing
- Thinking
- Mind's potency

These winds enable the spread of awareness throughout experience—cognitive, emotional, and physical.

[527-540]
Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
1. Wind of making movement
2. Wind of making liberation
3. Wind of making reversal
4. Wind of making swiftness
5. Wind of moments

They pervade:
- Aggregates
- Moments (instantaneous time)
- Bardo
- Concepts
- Three: moments, actions, completion

These are the most subtle winds connected with karma and the process of death and transition.

[541-557]
Thus twenty-five winds gather into five roots. The etymology from Self-Arisen:
- "Move-making wind"—because it makes movement on true ground
- "Life-holding wind"—because it holds life of pure wisdom
- "Color-radiance wind"—because it's the self-nature of five wisdom lights
- "Compassionless karma wind"—because it can liberate into wisdom's true dimension
- "Fire-equal wind"—because it abides without gathering or separating from wisdom's appearing

The essential point: in the five essence winds, relying on awareness wisdom, abiding in the heart, wisdom's self-sound-potential clears as five lights. When awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathers. The non-manifest outer and inner arrives at the essential point of pure wind-mind.

This is describing the completion stage realization where wind and mind merge into wisdom.
