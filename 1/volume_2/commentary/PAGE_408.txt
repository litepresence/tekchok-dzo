In the expanse of one's own primordially pure ground, self-knowing clarity—abiding in the portion of pure expanse. From the Sgron ma snang byed (Lamp Illuminating):

"To the perfect Buddha,
There are three wisdoms:
All-aspect knowing,
All-knowing wisdom,
Wisdom abiding in the basis.

Two wisdoms of nirmanakaya:
Knowing how things abide—knows the natural state,
Knowing how many—other-benefit.

Wisdom of sambhogakaya close by:
Luminosity self-appearance, knowables clear.

Wisdom of dharmakaya abiding in the basis:
Knowing portion makes clear,
No grasping, awareness-conceptuality.

Spontaneous force of compassion.
Clear and knowing, possessed of awareness,
Abiding without mixing with portions."

This is crucial! Three wisdoms:

1. **All-aspect knowing** (*rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa*) - knowing all phenomena in all their aspects
2. **All-knowing wisdom** (*thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes*) - knowing the nature of all things  
3. **Wisdom abiding in the basis** (*gzhi la gnas pa'i ye shes*) - primordial wisdom that never moved

Then for nirmanakaya, two wisdoms: knowing the natural state (how things are) and knowing what needs to be done for beings (how many things there are).

Sambhogakaya wisdom is the luminosity, the clear appearance of knowables.

Dharmakaya wisdom is beyond grasping, beyond conceptuality—spontaneous compassion.

These aren't separate things! They're all aspects of your own awareness. Right now, you have the capacity to know. That's wisdom. Don't look for it somewhere else!

Third, the meaning gathering of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity—twofold: essence briefly shown, and nature extensively explained. First:

Thus, if all dharmas of the Buddha-ground are gathered: kaya inexhaustible ornament wheel, appearing with form-kaya marks and signs clear; dharmakaya possessing the nature of all elaborations completely pacified; speech inexhaustible ornament wheel, with inconceivable Dharma wheels; mind inexhaustible ornament wheel, abandonment and realization nature measureless, clairvoyance inconceivable, essence of oceanic samadhi like the great ocean; qualities inexhaustible ornament wheel, ten powers, four fearlessnesses, measureless great compassion, mindfulness and so forth; enlightened activity inexhaustible ornament wheel, spontaneously accomplishing twofold benefit for all beings pervading the reaches of space.

Just this much alone, all enumerations of dharmas of the Buddha-ground are included—know this!

Look at this! This is what Buddhahood actually is—not some far-off goal, but the inexhaustible display of your own nature. The form body with its marks, the speech that teaches, the mind of wisdom, the qualities that benefit, the activities that help beings—all spontaneously present, never exhausted, never ending.

This isn't something you need to build up. It's something you need to recognize. Right now, in your own experience, these five are present. The ground of your being IS the Buddha-ground. Stop looking elsewhere!

As it is said...

Emaho! All dharmas are complete!
