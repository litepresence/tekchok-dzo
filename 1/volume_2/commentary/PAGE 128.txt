Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—that is a great error. They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward. If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment; being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future; it contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the basis of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse; it contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number. Such faults are not suitable to accept.

Fifth, the boundary: At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet, the occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and the boundary of inward return to outer vision. Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time, focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers, outer visions and the luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse, from merely the pure blue of direct objective vision, like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward, the self-resonance of body and vision also reverses, awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel, like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision, awareness buddha-fied into dharmakaya, coiled. If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action, moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.

Emaho! Great error to think no body and wisdom—expanse is full of both!
