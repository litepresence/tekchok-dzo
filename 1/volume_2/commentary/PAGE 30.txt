[1545-1562] Listen, dear practitioner! The mandala is not something to be drawn—it is primordially adorned, self-complete, and exists within yourself right now! The mudra is not something to transform—the ground itself is complete enlightenment, supreme body of the five kayas appearing. The deity-assembly is not produced—it is primordially complete, peaceful and wrathful, dwelling within your own being.

The mantra essence: channel-center letter wheel and that essence—four lamps as objects dawn. This too from the Self-Arising Tantra: all enlightened-activity mandala is not to be sought—it exists within the self; all enlightened-activity mudra is not to be transformed—it is complete within the four; all enlightened-activity deity-assembly is complete within one's own body; all enlightened-activity essence is called the great lamp of wisdom.

See how everything is already perfect? Don't go looking outside!

[1563-1587] Second: the nature-complete manner progressively extensively explained in two aspects—the original ground complete manner and the being-time complete manner. First, in two aspects from: generally shown.

The ground is originally primordially-pure; within, five wisdom lights in the depth of expanse are clear blue-green—all expanse is this; the dawn-basis of four enlightened-activity lights dwells, not to be counted. White, yellow, red, green—four that from blazing enlightened-activity explained. From that: that also four enlightened-activity meaning, blue-green itself is complete.

Four kinds of enlightened-activity ground are complete, therefore the color blue-green is explained. Four kinds of enlightened-activity meaning: ground is well complete, that also shows this thus. Color white and red various light, descended complete in the ground—white possesses the pacifying mandala; yellow is enriching light; red is regarded as power light; green is spoken as fierce light; blue-green is enlightened-activity complete light.

Emaho! Four lights, four activities—all spontaneously complete within your own mind! Don't think you need to create them!
