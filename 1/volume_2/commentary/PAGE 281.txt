Listen well! Specific contemplation [13161-13180]: conditioned things impermanent like dreams, illusions, etc. Intended Array: "Alas, conditioned things impermanent; born, disintegrating nature. Born then disintegrating—therefore quickly peaceful, happy."

Star, dewdrop, lamp, illusion [13181-13200], bubble, dream, lightning, cloud—conditioned things similar to these. Thus person's life span: uncertain, sudden, instantaneous—time cannot be grasped like this.

Extensive Play Sutra [13201-13220]: "Life impermanent like playful cloud; descending mountain waterfall, quickly swiftly goes."

Intended Array [13221-13240]: some die in womb, some just born, some running, some old, some young, some in youth—what confidence have the living?

Thus thinking impermanence [13241-13260], quickly certain to die, this life's business—attachment-aversion, fighting, laziness, hoarding, great desire, factionalism, taming enemies, hearing without applying, all talk with spiritual friends—what use?

Generally speaking [13261-13280]: life short, knowables many; life span unknown—like swan taking milk from water, accept one's desires. From today, strive at profound Dharma!

Also [13281-13300]: outer appearances looking, year's seasons four changes, impermanent continuous; day-night instant changes, moment impermanent; birth-death sequence thinking, nature impermanent.

Emaho!
