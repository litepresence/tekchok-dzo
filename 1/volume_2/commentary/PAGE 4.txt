Continuing the application of meaning—connecting each element's characteristic with awareness-wisdom:

Earth's characteristic of making solidity connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction. Why? Because earth is stable, unchanging, not born and destroyed like conditioned phenomena. This is the unborn nature of dharmakaya appearing as earth's solidity.

Wind's characteristic of lifting connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction. Wind moves freely, nothing blocks it—that's the unobstructed nature of wisdom.

Fire's characteristic of burning connects with awareness-wisdom gone under the authority of afflictions. Fire consumes, burns up afflictions. This is the wisdom that has power over the kleshas.

Water's characteristic of moistening connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects. Water flows everywhere, pervades everything—that's how wisdom enters all phenomena without obstruction.

Space's characteristic of vastness connects with awareness without break in continuity. Space is never interrupted, never cut—that's the continuous nature of rigpa.

Each element is pointing to a quality of awareness. This is the profound interconnection!

Eighth, the manner of liberation—from the Mutik Trengwa (Pearl Garland):

Space itself, by pervading emptiness, liberates space itself as entity. Space liberates into its own nature—pervading emptiness.

Wind, by appearing without graspable object, liberates into the function of gathering entities. Wind appears but you can't grasp it—it naturally liberates into gathering.

Fire, by consuming what ripens, liberates by moving and separating clarity from impurity. Fire burns, consumes, separates pure from impure.

Earth, when making the producer to lift, liberates into limitless empty non-entity. Earth's production function liberates into emptiness.

Water, by moistening what gathers, liberates into the function of ripening what burns. Water's moistening liberates into ripening.

This is describing how each element, when recognized in its true nature, liberates. Not by getting rid of it, but by recognizing its nature!

[195-225]
Ninth, divisions—the 25-fold elements. This is complex but profound. Each element contains all five elements within it:

Space contains space-wind, space-fire, space-water, space-earth, and space-space.
Wind contains wind-wind, wind-space, wind-water, wind-fire, wind-earth.
Water contains water-water, water-space, water-wind, water-fire, water-earth.
Fire contains fire-earth, fire-space, fire-wind, water-fire, fire-earth.
Earth contains earth-earth, earth-space, earth-wind, earth-water, earth-fire.

Five elements, each with five sub-elements: twenty-five total. This isn't just taxonomy—it's describing how each element has the nature of all elements within it. Space has wind-like movement, fire-like consuming, water-like gathering, earth-like support. And so on for each.

This is the mandala principle: each part contains the whole. Each element is a complete mandala of all five. This interpenetration is the nature of reality!

By training in these distinctions, specific qualities are accomplished. Each combination has its own special function and quality. This is the basis of element transformation practices in the completion stage.
