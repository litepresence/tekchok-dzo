Listen well, you who practice the Dharma! Previous essential instruction: Having grown familiar with three crucial points, recognizing face—like recognizing a familiar object, at that time without doubt, liberated [14442-14444].

This time's essential instruction: Sharp rigpa rising from ground like a shooting star in space, instantly knowing own face and liberating [14445-14446]. Dull rigpa, not recognizing appearance's distinctions, through power of previous profound practice, like a lion cub separating from womb, coarse purified, instant five, twenty-one faculties' whichever way liberated [14447-14450].

These also from Union of Sun and Moon: "This time has three: entering time, liberation time, completion time" [14451-14455].

Entering time is two: rigpa entering into light, and light entering into rigpa [14456-14458].

Liberation is three: rigpa liberated from conditions and elements; rigpa without stains, liberated from afflictions; rigpa itself not falling anywhere, liberated from outer and inner phenomena [14459-14404].

Completion is rigpa itself all phenomena's appearance simultaneously liberated [14405].

Method is two: previous essential instruction's crucial point and this time's sharp-dull difference [14406-14407].

Third topic: Summarizing meaning through self-display faculties' liberation way has three: faculties' division generally shown, liberation-delusion sequence specifically explained, and faculties' individual liberation way extensively spoken [14408-14411].

Emaho!
