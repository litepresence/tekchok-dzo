"The great effortless spontaneous perfection!" Thus it is said.

The second: specific explanation of how elements dissolve has two parts: sudden death by temporary conditions—the bodhisattva's breath-transference manner; and non-temporary conditioned gradual transference. The first: for those who suddenly die by collapse, fire, water, falling, or weapons without gradual element dissolution, rigpa transference—evil ones enter bad rebirths, good ones are born in good destinies. Those with little training from this view-meditation are born with happiness in high pure lands or as natural emanations.

The second: the outer five elements dissolve into the inner five elements. The inner five dissolve into the secret five. The secret five dissolve into the perfect five elements, then enter the great path of clear light dharmata! The first outer elements: the body's parts earth, water, fire, wind, and space five—these are called outer because they appear and produce. We don't mean external visible object elements! How the body's coarse five elements each dissolve has two: outer five dissolving into inner five, and inner five dissolving into outer five. The first: at death-time's beginning, each element's power as before disappears—earth dissolves into earth, power lost; water into water, gathering moist; fire into fire, heat lessens; wind into wind, breathing becomes difficult; space into space, clarity of consciousness fades, memory unclear!

Emaho! The elements return to themselves—like rivers to the ocean!
