Listen, you who seek liberation! Then vase throat held [14861-14880], bhy-lo age-number washing, from preta proceeds. Then vase secret-place held, rgya and wind's joining, from animals proceeds. Then vase right armpit held, kyem spoken washing, from asuras proceeds. Then vase crown held, tam spoken washing, from gods' place proceeds.

Then om ah hum svaha [14881-14900] spoken, vase heart held washing, human birth-place purified, precious human body drawn, that life liberation-fortune proceeds.

Thus three or five or seven days [14901-14920] done, aggregates burnt or transported, higher gods or liberation signs sky not arising impossible.

Sun-Moon Union [14921-14940]: "That itself dead time, that aggregates with outflows, vase crown placed, a syllable's essence and, wisdom water-stream purified, hell's places emptied, from that proceeds likewise. Preta signs possessed, bhye syllable's connection, breath with number seven; tongue's upper bhye placed, awareness essence that gathers; likewise vase mouth's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, preta places emptied, from that proceeds likewise."

Animal signs possessed [14941-14960], rgya syllable's connection, this one's place purifying; breath with nine times, sign rgya marked, awareness ones emptiness, repeatedly wind with thrown. Likewise vase sign's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, animal places emptied, from that proceeds likewise.

Emaho!
