[751-756] Definition of dharmakaya—naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding. From Self-Arising: fearless, empty, and clear, all actions complete. This is dharmakaya's definition. Don't be afraid of emptiness, friend! It's not nothingness—it's clarity itself!

[757-762] Self-body—freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere. No outer, no inner, no within expanse. This is dharmakaya's self-body. Stop looking for it as something to find or achieve!

[763-774] Metaphors for dharmakaya—six beautiful images from Self-Arising:
- Like sun: through clear-light awareness, illuminating all
- Like ocean: through depth, vast and profound  
- Like lotus: unstained by defects, pure by nature
- Like mountain: unchanging, immovable
- Like space: vast without boundary or center
- Like lion: possessing primordial confidence that surpasses all

Sun, ocean, lotus, mountain, space, lion—these are dharmakaya's metaphors. Not mere poetry! Each points to a quality of your own mind right now!

[775-779] Sign—transcending going and coming. Without going, without coming, without abiding. This is dharmakaya's self-sign. Not somewhere you travel to!

[780-784] Appearance—like empty-clarity of sky's expanse. Unceasing clear tone, empty by essence. This is dharmakaya's appearance. Clear yet empty, appearing yet unreal—like the sky!

[785-789] Place—great pure memory-thought. Without limit, without object, without grasping. This is dharmakaya's place. Not a location on a map!

[790-795] Characteristic—essence, nature, compassion, three inseparable. This is dharmakaya's characteristic. Not one, not three—indivisible!

[796-802] Object—self-clear awareness, empty without extremity, adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished. In great inseparability of expanse and awareness. Clear, luminous, unmixed—this is dharmakaya's object.

[803-806] Intent—view unsevered by direction or side, meditation not established as entity or sign, conduct transcending apprehending and grasping.

Emaho! Dharmakaya complete in ten aspects!
