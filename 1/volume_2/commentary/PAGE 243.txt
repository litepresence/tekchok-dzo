Hear the completion of signs! [11656-11680] Thus the path of thod rgal has been fully explained—the lamp gazing, the four visions arising, the light displays, and the signs of realization. You who practice, do not be lazy! The bindus of light are your own rigpa's display, not external objects. Like a face in a mirror, they appear yet have no true existence.

[11681-11705] When you see the smoke-like, mirage-like, and rainbow displays, know these are the signs of wisdom dawning. Do not grasp at them, do not reject them—rest evenly in their nature. As the bindus expand into forms and mandalas, recognize them as your own face. This is the crucial point.

[11706-11730] The five lamps shine from within—the lamp of the heart, the lamp of the pure channels, the lamp of the eyes, and the others. Through these, the light of wisdom naturally radiates outward. Day and night, in all activities, maintain this recognition.

[11731-11755] The four visions arise progressively—from direct perception of dharmata, to the increase of experience, to the perfection of rigpa, and finally to the exhaustion of phenomena. At each stage, do not cling to the experiences. Rest in the nature of the experiences themselves.

[11756-11780] When the pure lands and buddha forms appear, do not think 'I have attained!' or 'This is excellent!' These too are merely displays of your own awareness. The true buddha is not a form—you must recognize your own nature beyond all form.

[11781-11805] Through this practice, the material body becomes light, speech becomes melodious, and mind becomes all-pervasive. These are the signs of progress. Yet do not be attached even to these signs. The final result is beyond all signs and attainment.

Emaho!
