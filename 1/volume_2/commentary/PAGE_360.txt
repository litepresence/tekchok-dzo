Listen here, you who fear the bardo! Longchenpa explains something profound about the intermediate state - but you might miss the essential point while counting days!

"These twenty appearance-birth modes complete in seven days." The master isn't giving you a timetable of rebirth! He's describing how consciousness naturally manifests in different ways. But students immediately start counting: "If no life from that? Again latency's power!"

Look at this profound teaching: "Intermediate existence that life, seven days passed, exhausted. If no life from that? Again latency's power, former appearance awakened, mind body taken, seven times die." Do you understand? The bardo isn't some waiting room - it's the natural capacity of your mind to create new experiences! "Seven times die" means consciousness can project itself seven times before exhausting its momentum.

"Seven times birth appears, like dream's birth-death." This is crucial! Like dreams appearing and disappearing each night - not because you're really dying and reborn, but because consciousness naturally displays itself! "Seven births also miraculously born" - consciousness can manifest without karmic momentum when conditions align!

"Death and birth all done in instant" - This is the key! In bardo, birth and death aren't sequential like in life. They happen simultaneously - instant manifestations of consciousness projecting and withdrawing.

"If virtue's power applied, seven sevens' seven periods greatly beneficial." When you apply practice during bardo, you're not accumulating merit for future rebirth - you're purifying the very momentum of consciousness itself!

Now the colors of rebirth - listen carefully! "Later whatever born body's sign appearing. God-human birth, white. Demi-god and animal birth, yellow. Hungry ghost birth, smoke-like. Hell birth, black wool scattered-like." These aren't literal descriptions! White for god realm isn't about skin color - it's the purity of divine birth. Yellow isn't demi-gods being yellow - it's the quality of desire-energy manifesting!

"Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing." By the seventh time, if you still haven't recognized nature, karmic patterns reassert themselves strongly. The color that appears indicates the predominant karmic tendency pulling consciousness toward particular realm!

"This continuum: From above Sambhogakaya's color and hand-emblem seeing." The signs aren't random - they're your own sambhogakaya wisdom recognizing where consciousness is heading! But the crucial teaching: "Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing" - if after seven cycles you still haven't awakened, the momentum strengthens.

Emaho! The bardo lasts at most forty-nine days - not because it's limited, but because your consciousness has that much natural momentum. But if you recognize mind's nature during any of these appearances, you're instantly liberated - no more counting days!
