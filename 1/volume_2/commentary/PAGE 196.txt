Its example from Vajrasattva heart mirror—"Aho! Vajra holder listen! Immature conceptions samsara, like corpse iron-bound, not liberated, liberation time not arising. Ignorance iron-bound not changed. Ignorance like water, afflictions gathering. Anger fire like eon fire mass. Desire things like drinking salt water. Delusion thick like empty house darkness. Pride arrogance like crushing mountain. Jealousy ill-will like narrow ravine gorge. Five afflictions wisdom-obscuring. Mind like bitch thief. Consciousness like forest monkey. Mind like impure mud. All-ground like being pig. Knowing like feather wind-carried. Grasping-grasped like man woman. Karma varieties like bird net entangled. Suffering varieties like water ripples. Affliction result no endurance method. Samsara's suffering grasping-grasped spear—by doing not out, by placing goes out. Abandoned doing dharmas leisure accomplished. Abandoned all thought supreme wisdom unmoved. Secret mantra king afflictions wisdom-become. Like empty house lamp raised, wisdom lamp ignorance knowing-becomes."

Emaho! Afflictions transform into wisdom!
