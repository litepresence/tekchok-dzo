Great bliss liberation has no finding-time. You don't discover it. You don't achieve it. You stop drowning in the boat that's sinking into water. The mind that thinks it exists—this support, this foundation you stand on—is the deception itself. It's not real but it binds you tighter than chains.

Samantabhadra said it plainly: wanting dharmakaya as an object? Obstruction. Wanting whatever appears as mind? Obstruction. Wanting self-arising as something other than this? Obstruction. Even your longing for liberation can become a cage.

Does mind dissolve from existence into non-existence? The question assumes mind was something that could exist. But look—dissolve under examination and nothing holds. Un-examined, thoughts arise and dissolve on their own. No continuum going from here to there. No place where dissolution happens. No cause for dissolution. No condition for it.

So is destroying mind's house pointless since nothing was there to destroy? Exactly. That's the point. To primordially non-existent mind, there's nothing to get rid of—just recognition of what was never there. Memory's source going to dharmata isn't moving anywhere. It's seeing that there was never a mover.

The teaching calls it "destroying the house" but that's just words. Destroying the existent—nothing to destroy, nothing destroyed. Result is non-dual: object-mind without division, knowing without separation.

Sixteen non-existent dharmas—this isn't a new list to memorize. It's pointing at how everything you think is solid is empty. The Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence cuts through everything: mind was never born, so it never needs to be liberated. Movement is sudden, already free. Other instructions point at mind ultimately non-existent while pretending to exist conventionally.

Rest in that pretending. The pretending is the freedom.

Nothing more. The end of the path is not a place you arrive at. It's the recognition that you were never moving.

Rest now. The rest is complete.
