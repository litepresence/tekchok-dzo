Nine vehicles! Eight lower vehicles. Supreme path surpasses all.

Eight lower: Six Liberation Vehicles of Sravakas: Single Form Realm vehicles (three groups), Formless Realm vehicles (three groups), Sound-hearer vehicle—Vedas path. These are gradual—need eons to perfect.

One Dzogchen vehicle: Secret Mantra Supreme Vehicle—sudden path surpassing all. It has two divisions: scriptural ground and wisdom ground.

Scriptural ground: Outer—all Dharmas, inner—non-appearance beyond extremes, secret—appearance non-arisen. All nine vehicles taught, but these are just preliminary teachings to lead minds gradually to maturation.

Wisdom ground: Outer—all Dharmas as bliss emptiness, inner—all Dharmas as natural presence, secret—appearance and mind inseparable.

Three analogies showing Dzogchen's supremacy: Daughter of Dakini, dream path, prison of worldly life. Dream path perfects in one sleep, others take many lifetimes. Prison instant liberation happens when one hears of Dzogchen—like hearing nirvana, fear and grasping are exhausted.

Emaho! One path instantly surpasses all others!
