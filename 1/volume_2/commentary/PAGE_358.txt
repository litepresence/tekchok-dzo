That too, god-human birth taken, that aspect. Form realm birth, first light body existing thought. Formless upward birth time, formless, aspect not arising, yet sky and mere wind appearance from birth. Formless from lower realm transferring time, half former's samadhi and mere wind self-emanated samadhi's aspect other non-existent. Half later, wherever born's aspect arising.
