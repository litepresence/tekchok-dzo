[807-823] Dharmakaya's conduct—free from cessation, fixation, attachment. Not something you do, friend—it's what remains when you stop doing! Meditation—crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering. Not a technique, just recognition! View—unseen, yet seeing-complete. Not something to look at, but the looking itself! Fruition—unmade, unarisen, free from arising. Already perfect, never needed making! Activity—nothing to accomplish, yet accomplished-complete. Enlightened activity happens without anyone doing it!

[824-839] Now Sambhogakaya—five aspects. Essence from Self-Arising: birth exists yet death-free, possessing vajra. Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear. Five fathers, five fields, five clusters. Five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations. Five bases, five paths, five fruitions. Five abodes, five fields, five essences. This is sambhogakaya's essence—complete display of enlightenment!

[840-847] Though expressed as birth from expanse, birth lacks self-characteristic—death-free! Death-lord demon conquered. From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges. Arisen wisdom transcends all arising. Realizing wisdom transforms meaning. In vast kayas, outer and inner clear.

[848-858] Five lights: blue, white, yellow, red, green. Five kayas: essence-expanse, unchanging vajra, dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Five fathers: Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.

All this richness—not separate from you! Complete mandala of enlightenment right here!

Emaho!
