[1021] Essence of Nirmanakaya: from kaya of expanse and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya, performing benefit for others. Emanation—appearing for others' sake, not separate from dharmakaya and sambhogakaya.

[1022-1034] Etymology from Self-Arising—nine reasons it's called emanation-kaya:
1. Appearing suitable to world realm beings
2. Able to perform emanation-kaya's benefit  
3. Performing all actions
4. Able to liberate countless beings into expanse
5. Brief in time in one field realm
6. Compassion arising without direction
7. Wrathful and fierce when needed
8. Peaceful and certain
9. Beings see as beautiful

All these ways compassion appears—not limited to peaceful forms!

[1036-1041] Characteristic: performing completion of two benefits for disciples. From Self-Arising: performing completion of actions, considered in two aspects.

[1042-1051] Divisions: generally nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, etc. Here, depending on completion of two benefits: emanation-kaya of completed actions and emanation-kaya of performing actions. Self-benefit spontaneously established—completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate. Through three connections' emanation, benefit for six realms' self-appearance. Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful. Samsara's self-appearance must be emptied, for delusion-appearance must be emptied.

[1052-1061] Common prayer: "May three lower realms be exhausted and emptied." For producing mind to liberate all beings. Particularly in bardo: releasing emanations, becoming Buddha—all actions. When six realms' stations appear in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate, teaching Dharma performs benefit. By that cause, samsara becomes empty, dissolving into nirvana through spontaneous accomplishment—called "Buddha entering nirvana."

[1062] This crucial for all with wisdom!

[1063-1071] Appearance in emptiness for self-benefit, emanation arisen from oneself liberating oneself into expanse—called emanation-kaya of completed actions. From Self-Arising: liberating own continuum, manifestly awakened, then distributing emanations. Outer and inner actions complete. Thus considered emanation-kaya of completed actions.

Three kayas complete, friend—now recognize them in your own experience!

Emaho!
