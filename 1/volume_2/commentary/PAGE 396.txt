Listen! Longchenpa quotes from Sengge Tsal Dzog (Lion's Perfected Power): "Vajrasattva's suchness and self-appearance mandala pure of the two—similar ground, one, yet difference of straying is great." This is a crucial warning! The nature of mind (Vajrasattva's suchness) and its self-display (the mandala) have the same ground—they're not two different things. But the difference between recognizing this and not recognizing it? Vast! Like the difference between a rich man and a beggar who both live in the same house but one knows he owns it and the other doesn't!

Pay attention to this philosophical subtlety—it's easy to get confused! If internal expanse and external clear-appearance-path are not divided, and the three bodies are held as the result of self-appearance, then just as Nirmanakaya appears to trainees, the primordially pure Dharmakaya of the place of liberation would also appear to trainees. Since the three bodies are one in essence, Dharmakaya would appear as gathering-dispersing and colors!

Or alternatively, Nirmanakaya would not appear to trainees because Dharmakaya doesn't appear. This is the dilemma! Longchenpa is showing the logical consequences if you hold wrong views about the kayas.

The resolution? The three bodies should not be grasped as one in essence and one in appearance. Nirmanakaya is the compassion aspect. What appears from that compassion is reflected-image emanation, not actual Nirmanakaya, because it's not compassion itself.

This distinction of tenets is extremely subtle—wise ones should examine and understand it in their minds. This is a crucial point!

Emaho! Longchenpa is protecting you from philosophical errors that could derail your practice for lifetimes. Don't just skim over this—ponder it deeply!

Second: Explaining the meaning of the context in three parts: General presentation of the abodes of three bodies. Specific explanation of pristine awareness abodes. Summarizing the meaning of the five abodes of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.

From the first, from the three—Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—first, extensive explanation of Dharmakaya's abode has four: essence, divisions, enumerations, extensive explanation. The essence of Dharmakaya is self-arising pristine awareness, empty-clear, free from elaboration.

From five aspects—abiding mode, characteristics, nature, compassion, appearance-mode: Essence's abiding mode: Abiding unsullied by any flaw, primordially pure nature. That essence's characteristic: Empty, possessing the heart of awareness. That essence's nature: Not mixed with anything. That essence's compassion: Undivided, non-dividing, without division. That essence's appearance-mode: Without duality.

The definition is...

Don't make this abstract! This is describing your present moment of awareness. Unsullied by any problem—ever! Empty yet aware. Not mixed with thoughts or emotions. Compassion that doesn't need to divide subject from object. And it all appears without the duality of inside and outside, self and other. This isn't philosophy—this is your immediate experience when you stop grasping!
