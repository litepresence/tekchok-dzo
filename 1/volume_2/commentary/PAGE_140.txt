[5907-5911] Listen here! From Self-Arisen: "Ground called does not exist elsewhere! To one truth-seeing person, all grounds completely exist!" That introduction-shown person—first, at truth-seeing time, joy arisen to that is first ground, Great Joy!

[5912-5921] To that, knowing own-vision is awareness—second ground Stainless obtained! Then habituation to that—third ground Light-Doing conquered! Then habituated, seeing light's vision—fourth ground Light-Radiating conquered! Then habituated to wisdom's vision, all afflictions self-nature purified, seeing wisdom—fifth ground Difficult-to-Overcome conquered! Then from light, dust body manifest—sixth ground Manifest conquered! Then habituation completed, afflictions far-gone—seventh ground Far-Going conquered!

Do you see? All ten grounds are in one moment of truth-seeing! Not sequential stages—simultaneous complete!

Emaho! The ten grounds of Dzogchen—all complete in one seeing!
