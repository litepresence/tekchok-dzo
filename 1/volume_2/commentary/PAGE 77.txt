Hear this! "Upon mind appearing as contact, consciousness of contacted object self-pure in its own place." What you feel, what touches you—right there is liberation!

Third meaning: continuous practice of view has four aspects. View cutting through the city's continuum. Its instruction: mountain-relaxation method. Its intention: three realms completely liberated.

First, nature. Divisions. From three stages: view's nature is appearance-existence, container-contained, dwelling liberated from the beginning—connected with conceptual mind. Thalgyur says: "View's nature—container-contained, nowhere not pervaded, everything liberated. Liberated dharmas free from ripening."

See? Nothing to fix, nowhere to go. The view isn't something you adopt—it's recognizing how things already are!

Emaho! The city of samsara has no walls!
