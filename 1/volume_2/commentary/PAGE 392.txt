Listen carefully! In one's own face, existence-nonexistence elaboration pacified, not even established as mere body and pristine awareness. Other-appearance as Buddha's compassion and trainees' aspiration prayers, form body and activity appearing together, this is like garuda's offering-pillar, wish-fulfilling jewel, and wish-fulfilling tree. From Avatamsaka: "Peaceful body clear like wish-fulfilling tree, like wish-fulfilling jewel, without conceptions, benefiting sentient beings' world until liberation, always. This appears while free from elaboration." Thus.

Emaho! What a metaphor! The Buddha's appearance isn't like a person deciding to help—it's as natural as a wish-fulfilling jewel granting wishes without intention. The garuda's offering-pillar appears spontaneously without being constructed. Your own nature, when recognized, benefits beings without you "trying to be compassionate." This is effortless compassion—much more profound than manufactured kindness!

Here too, though similar to primordially pure's own face, from subtle pristine awareness existing in expanse, body and pristine awareness appear. Doing benefit for those who made aspiration prayers to be actually benefited by Buddha through it. Distinguished by the special feature of being spontaneously accomplished from essence aspect, not wishing to be produced by cause-aspiration prayers.

These are crucial points of primordially pure result—wise ones should know with very refined intelligence!

Don't miss this! The benefit to beings doesn't happen because Buddha "decides" to help. It happens spontaneously because that's the nature of awareness. Like the sun shining—it's not deciding to warm each person, it just shines. The aspiration prayers of beings align with this natural compassion, but they don't create it!

Second general meaning: Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance in two parts: General presentation of body divisions. Specifically explaining nature of three kayas. First has five: Explained as one body: Ground awareness one. Path awareness place one. Result awareness stainless primordially pure one—from this perspective, the unchanging vajra body, empty, heart of pristine awareness, spontaneously accomplished jewel womb, first Buddha, sky-like free from extremes.

From Self-Arising: Emaho! Great appearance, great clarity. Pure sky, free from limits. Elaboration-free suchness, unchanging. Free from extremes, center, directions, parts. Self-appearance dharmadhatu pure field. First Buddha, without cause. Last, not produced by conditions. Empty pristine awareness heart-endowed. Not abiding extremes, vajra body. Elaboration-free suchness...

This verse is magnificent! Don't read it as poetry—read it as your own nature described! "First Buddha without cause"—your nature was never created. "Not produced by conditions"—no circumstances can make or unmake it. "Empty pristine awareness"—the heart of wisdom that's always been yours!
