[4193-4198] Also at first body formation time, speech and mind two relying on that form. First body conduct must be done! Body conduct done, afterward body karma depleted, doing un-enthusiastic, body sins purified purpose exists! From Wheel Arrangement: "Who divided body's border, this samsara's latency exhausted!"

Do you see? Body's border must be divided! Reverse the body's actions! Exhaust samsara's latency!

Emaho! Dividing the body's border!
