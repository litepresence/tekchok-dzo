[Line range] Don't miss this! These are the final instructions—the cream of the teachings.

When everything falls away—concepts, practices, even the notion of enlightenment—what remains? That naked awareness, completely free, utterly complete. This is what you've been seeking your whole life, and it's been right here all along.

You don't need to become a buddha. You already are one—you just don't recognize it. Like a poor person sitting on a treasure chest, not knowing what's beneath them.

Open your eyes! See what Longchenpa is pointing to. Don't let another moment pass in confusion.

This is it. Right here. Right now.

Emaho! The treasure is in your own heart!
