The common pervasive space dissolves into pure lamp-space! The objectless clear space dissolves into rigpa! The unmixed pure space dissolves into dharmadhatu! The meaning-indicating space dissolves into prajna! The space that liberates into pure lands dissolves into the twenty-one! All spaces are spaces, yet each has its function, each its destination. Like different doors to the same treasury—each opens, each reveals!

Emaho! Space within space—like a jewel within a jewel!
