Conduct maturation! How it relates to Dakini recitation.

First: Dakini Recitation's four divisions: outer, inner, secret, very secret.

Outer: essence's emanation—emptiness emanates as display. When maturing ten perfections, one sees emptiness in all appearances and can emanate emanations as needed, like teacher from limitless treasure.

Inner: sound's emanation—mantra emanates as sound. Body and speech's causes, mind's recitation all engage mantra emanation, three doors all recite.

Secret: unification emanation—mind and mantra inseparable. Body, speech, mind become single, practice unified.

Very secret: mind-support emanation—mind simply abides, recitation unceasing. Single-pointed focus pervades, maturation makes dakinis gather offering.

Then connection with ground path: Dakini recitation's maturation purifies ten defilements, completes accumulations, ripens faculties, purifies obscurations—makes ordinary vehicles' conduct and view mature completely.

Emaho! Dakinis gather offering of single-pointed mind!
