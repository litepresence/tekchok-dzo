By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—this same, certain. Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye in body, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands. Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye in heart, seeing separate from sound-word, hearing and contemplation all dharmata's meaning dawns. Three eyes' gaze: dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down. Equal gaze at wisdom's corner, mixing samsara-nirvana taste. Lower look with discriminating-awareness, deliver wisdom vision.

Lazy one: sambhogakaya. Diligent one: nirmanakaya. Equanimity one: dharmakaya gaze—auspicious! Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata, gaze pure, obscuration exhausted. Field's main point: outer dhatu's field is empty sky separate from clouds; inner dhatu's field—gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot, dhatu-vision blue, five self-resonances arise.

[4745-4751]
From Thalgyur: dhatu outer and inner; outer gaze at cloud-separate sky; when dust and rain removed, press direct main point, make inner lamp the path. Outer: awareness dawning field. Inner: experience increasing field. Awareness and experience, from two not existing, called samsara-nirvana mixed. Earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse—gaze at field, not liberated. First: not desiring vision dawn. Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like, knowing compatible arises, emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning.

Emaho! Gaze at the sky and meet your own mind face-to-face!
