[2573-2577] Listen, friend! Who meditates union-bliss—by this, makes sense-objects the path. Who makes intermediate-space the path—by this, obtains power over mind. Thus it is. Don't reject appearances—transform them into the path of bliss!

[2578-2598] Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, the method of holding mind upon five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. From the Thalgyur: eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Train upon the ground of five sense-objects!

Forms—face-shapes and forms, arts and illusions, different types, and eye-magic etc.—various appearances. Sounds—lute, vase-drum, stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and pheng, har, etc. Smells—fragrance joined, and do through pleasing dependent-arising profound. Tastes—molasses with six, and grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed, dependent-arising branches joined.

Touch—the skilled one sits upon throne, scriptures mixed, joined elements, and by means of some tree leaves, by touch alone upon dharmata, dwells with non-separated mind. Thus it is.

[2599-2628] Especially, the stages of making four elements yoga. From that is spoken: training stage of three kayas itself, making qualities of elements chief, and supreme—earth, water, fire, wind. Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished.

Upon explanation of water's sound, holds dakini's sound-melody. If always familiarized with this, certainly accomplishes emanation-body. Earth's sound—cool and heavy, possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice. If always hearing-training upon this, certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body. Fire's sound—self-made, trained, shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody. Who practices hearing upon this, certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities. Wind's sound—cutting, resounding, Garuda king's practice-speech. If knowing this always reciting, common training of three kayas.

Thus, sound-meaning of four elements, certainly apply to outer times. Winter, spring, summer, autumn—water, earth, fire, wind—apply certainly to sequence of times, and if made suited to yoga body, accomplishment—without doubt in this. Thus it is.

Emaho! Four elements yoga! Everything is the path when you know how to use it!
