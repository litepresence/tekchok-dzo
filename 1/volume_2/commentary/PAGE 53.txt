[2573-2577] Who meditates union-bliss—by this makes sense-objects the path. Who makes intermediate-space the path—by this obtains power over mind. Thus it is.

[2578-2598] Furthermore, as auxiliary to these, method of holding mind upon five objects of appearance—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. From Thalgyur: eye, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Train upon ground of five sense-objects. Forms—face-shapes and forms, and arts and illusions, different, and eye-magic etc.—various. Sounds—lute, vase-drum, and stringed instruments, clay-drum, flute, and pheng, har, etc. Smells—fragrance joined, and do through pleasing dependent-arising profound. Tastes—molasses with six, and grape-wine mixtures—variously transformed, dependent-arising branches joined. Touch—skilled one sits upon throne, scriptures mixed, joined elements, and by means of some tree leaves, by touch alone upon dharmata, dwells with non-separated mind. Thus it is.

[2599-2628] Especially, stages of making four elements yoga. From that is spoken: training stage of three kayas itself, making qualities of elements chief, and supreme—earth, water, fire, wind. Trained upon sounds—certainly accomplished. Upon explanation of water's sound, holds dakini's sound-melody. If always familiarized with this, certainly accomplishes emanation-body. Earth's sound—cool and heavy, possesses Great Brahma's sound-voice. If always hearing-training upon this, certainly accomplishes enjoyment-body. Fire's sound—self-made, trained, shows Vishnu-great's speech-melody. Who practices hearing upon this, certainly obtains dharma-body's qualities. Wind's sound—cutting, resounding, Garuda king's practice-speech. If knowing this always reciting, common training of three kayas. Thus, sound-meaning of four elements, certainly apply to outer times. Winter, spring, summer, autumn—water, earth, fire, wind—apply certainly to sequence of times, and if made suited to yoga body, accomplishment—without doubt in this. Thus it is.

Emaho! Four elements yoga!
