Listen well, practitioner! The mandala itself becomes periphery walls and individual chief-retinue form-vision [5247], the dharmakaya purification fully pure measure arriving [5248]. This is the awareness measure-arrive vision [5249]!

During preliminary time, body actions connect measures [5250-5251] - though separation results and purify-object, purify-agent cause-effect are merely designated [5252], they do not arise from production [5253]. Wisdom self-exists, resonating, purifying defilement obscuration forcefully through vision [5254].

The Thalgyur teaches: "Awareness measure-arrive vision, sambhogakaya marks-examples clear, uncertain color like rainbow, five families father and mother form-vision" [5255-5259]. The Bstan bu states: "Thus until body is reached, sixteen and ten and five and three, without doubt sambhogakaya" [5262-5265].

Second, explaining nature particularly [5266]: measure-arrive definition explained generally [5267], measure three explained particularly [5268]. First, awareness measure-arrive means awareness basis-abide becomes awareness manifest [5270], entering the path from basis-vision self-resonance spontaneously accomplished through dawn-door body-form-vision [5271-5272].

When path-vision exhausts near, mandalas complete [5273-5274]. Measure is first from half-body until body mandala complete [5275] - arriving means from that, exceeding place not existing, form-vision like full moon [5276-5277], waxing increase ceasing, mandala complete, self-essence not fabricated [5278].

Second, measure three particular explained: outer vision, inner body measure, secret awareness measure [5279-5282]. First: vision control lands, light-clear complete [5283]. The Thalgyur says: "Thus from arriving complete measure, direct entity-vision cease, earth stone vision melt, self-know whatever enter" [5285-5289].

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your own body becomes the mandala! Emaho!
