Knowledge entering others doesn't arise. Scripture validates: from Golden Essence Tantra—"By naked liberation's great view, Buddhas and beings both liberated."

Reason: validated by free-from-directions self-pure reason. Thus appearance nakedly liberated—placed in naked place, liberated where placed, released where liberated.

Liberation mode: trained on particular objects, particularly nakedly liberated—gone nowhere, come from nowhere, no place to go. Not changing wherever abiding. Trained on general objects, all appearance gone to naked liberation.

Example: like sense-capable person going to temple—no viewing duality.

Fourth: extreme liberation depending on freedom-from-reference key—reference not applicable anywhere. Liberated from one extreme, not abiding as two, liberated from two so not abiding as one. Similarly both, neither, etc.

Extreme: existence-extreme appearance, nonexistence-extreme non-appearance, both, neither—four extremes ceased called liberation.

Extreme liberation free-from-reference has three: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode.

Understanding: existence, nonexistence, appearance, emptiness extremes—reference inapplicable. Beyond this-is, this-isn't calculation.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: validated by reference-free nature reasoning.

Emaho! Liberated from all extremes and references!
