Listen here! Longchenpa is completing the discussion of Dharmakaya—the Body of Reality. Look at what he's saying: the qualities never reverse, never change, never transform! And the activity? It arises spontaneously, without cessation, abiding as the ground itself. This isn't some philosophical abstraction—this is describing your own nature!

The quote from Thal 'gyur (the consequence tradition) lays it out perfectly: Dharmakaya is body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity—all five! But don't mistake this for some cosmic administrator sitting on a throne. Body is emptiness, clarity, and signless nature. Speech is free from sound, words, and names—beyond all expression. Mind transcends thought and movement, beyond proliferation and analysis. Qualities are without coming or going, pervading expanse and pristine awareness, nature unalterable. Activity is unarisen, unborn, arising through dynamic energy without cessation, beyond created and uncreated.

Emaho! What a wonder! This is not describing something far away—this is pointing directly to what you are, right now, if you would only recognize it!

Now we turn to the second topic: Sambhogakaya, the Enjoyment Body, explained extensively. Longchenpa gives us the structure: essence, definition, divisions, and enumerations—four aspects.

The essence-characteristic is great self-clarity, completely perfect. The way it abides is unmoving in nature—manifesting marks and examples, clear in families, unmoving. This is not some static thing—it's vibrant, luminous, yet utterly stable.

The definition of Sambhogakaya: appearing as Sambhogakaya, engaging in that very appearance, knowledge without obstruction engaging—this is it. The body is great self-clarity, vast display. Don't make it complicated! This is the radiance of your own awareness, wearing the ornaments of luminosity.

[16533-16547]
Now the four divisions of Sambhogakaya:
1. The Body of Great Element Essence
2. The Body of All-Pervading Abiding
3. The Body of the Path of Appearance
4. The Body of Appearance for Trainees

The first: from the ground-appearance of Dharmakaya, self-arising, perfected as the body endowed with fivefold luminosity—this is the nature of ground-appearance as great elements: clarity-warmth, coolness, expansiveness, pervasiveness. Don't think this is physics! These are wisdom qualities, not material elements. The warmth of compassion, the coolness of clarity, the expansiveness of space-like mind, the pervasiveness of benefitting all.

[16547-16563]
The second body: for all Buddhas and sentient beings alike, pervaded by light and light-dwellings, the portion manifesting. From Self-Arising: "Abiding as the heart of light for all, thought-free pure dharmadhatu, matchless sole unique one, center and circle and palace, awareness and emptiness and clarity."

This is describing the mandala of your own being! The palace is not somewhere in space—it's the space of your own awareness. The center is rigpa, the circle is its display, the palace is the dimension in which recognition occurs. Don't look for this in a thangka painting—look for it in the immediacy of your own experience!

Emaho! Like light filling a room the moment the lamp is lit, this body pervades all without effort or intention. What a wonder!
