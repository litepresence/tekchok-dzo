Listen here! Buddha's speech—it's appearance without inherent existence. Like an echo, like a reflection. It appears to trainees through the gathering of their merit and the Buddha's blessing, but in reality, there are no syllables with self-characteristic.

From the Gyud Lama (Uttaratantra):

"The speech of the Victors
Is like an echo, without letters."

And just as an echo's sound
Arises from others' cognition,
Without conceptual fabrication or contrivance—
Just so is the Tathagata's speech.

Arising from others' cognition,
Without conceptual fabrication,
Just so is the Tathagata's speech.
Not abiding outside or inside.

What does this mean? When the Buddha speaks, he's not really "saying" anything! The words appear to you based on your own mind, your own karma, your own capacity. The Buddha doesn't open his mouth and produce syllables. The syllables appear spontaneously in your mind based on causes and conditions. This is the magical display of enlightened speech!

Don't think the Buddha is somewhere "over there" giving a talk. The teaching appears directly in your own awareness. The sound is empty, yet it appears. It's a reflection, an echo—profoundly clear, yet without inherent existence.

From Tsal Dzog (Complete Potency):

"Empty of the nature of speech appearing,
Various definitive terminology of speech arises,
Shown as divided into six aspects:
The speech of Buddha's enlightened activity,
Brahma's divine offering-speech,
The self-sounds of six realms' confusion,
Beings' believing taming-speech,
The secret mother's symbolic speech,
Various sounds shown as speech."

These are the six types of Buddha speech! The enlightened speech isn't just one thing—it manifests differently depending on the context. Sometimes it's the formal speech of enlightened activity, sometimes it appears as divine speech, sometimes as the confused sounds of beings, sometimes as teaching that tames the mind, sometimes as secret symbolic communication. All of these are manifestations of the same enlightened speech, appearing according to what's needed.

Don't get stuck thinking Buddha speech means "the Buddha talking." It can appear as anything—wind in the trees, the cry of a bird, a stranger's words. When you're ready to hear the Dharma, the Dharma appears. That's Buddha speech!

[17034-17046]
Third, regarding Mind—its essence is without confusion. Its definitive terminology: awareness clear in its own place. Divided: the mind of wisdom of abandonment perfectly complete, memory awakened; the mind of wisdom of realization perfectly complete, unchanging vajra mind; the mind of wisdom of enlightened activity perfectly complete, various knowing minds—three.

From That Very:

"Essence of mind without confusion,
Definitive terminology of mind appearing to thought,
Shown as divided into three:
Mind itself memory-awakened,
Vajra unchanging mind, and
Shown as various-knowing mind."

The Buddha's mind isn't something distant, something other. It's awareness clear in its own place—your own awareness! The three aspects are: the awakened memory (not forgetting the nature of reality), the unchanging vajra mind (not subject to birth and death), and the omniscient mind knowing all things.

But here's the key: these aren't three separate minds. They're three aspects of the same awareness. Your awareness, right now, has these qualities. You just don't recognize them yet!

[17047-17051]
Fourth, regarding Qualities—their essence is the perfectly complete Dharma of the Buddha-ground. Definitive terminology: like a jewel, because all perfect excellent qualities arise spontaneously. Divided:

The qualities of the basis—dharmakaya abiding in its own place, self-benefit complete;
The qualities of the path-appearance—sambhogakaya clear in the mandala, other-benefit appearing.

This is the completion of the three kayas and five aspects. The qualities aren't something the Buddha acquires—they're spontaneously present, like a jewel naturally radiating light. Self-benefit is complete through dharmakaya. Other-benefit appears through sambhogakaya. Both are natural expressions of enlightened nature.

Stop looking for qualities somewhere else! They're right here, in your own nature, spontaneously complete. You don't need to build them up—you need to recognize what's already present!

Emaho! What a wonder!
