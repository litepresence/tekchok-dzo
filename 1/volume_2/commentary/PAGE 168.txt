Completion—dharmata's mandala, natural flow, river continuum samadhi without break! Without effort, without depending on cause and effect, wondrous great accomplishments are spontaneously obtained. This is the great mandala of supreme ground!

From the Tal 'Gyur:
"Thus all is dharmata—nothing to accept, nothing to place, nothing's dharmata. Whatever appears, from its own dharmata, there's no fabricated dharmata elsewhere. However done, unthought arises. Without abandoning or accepting—self-appearance!"

[7163-7178]
From Self-Arising:
"Don't attach to appearance. Don't establish non-existence. Don't abandon existence. Don't hope for non-existence. Don't apprehend existence. Don't establish what is done. Don't cease what arises. Don't view arising as fault. Don't abandon afflictions. Don't establish Buddhas. Don't meditate meditation. Don't view view. Don't cease deluded appearance. Don't seek pure appearance."

[7179-7182]
From Nor Bu 'Phrul Bkod: "When knowing that cognizes objects appears to objects, appearance is self-appearance. At that time, let awareness release into openness."

[7183-7194]
The third meaning—all transcended from the start in the great expanse of spontaneous evenness. Without bondage or liberation, without abandoning or accepting—in the great nameless samsara-nirvana. These are the twelve great vajra laughs of the great perfection, pointing to the greatness of the crucial key:

Great perfection of nature, great nameless samsara-nirvana, great transcendence of cause and effect, great already-complete without doing, great self-liberation without abandoning or accepting, great effortless dynamic display...

From the Great Heap of Jewels Tantra:
"Kye! Vajra heart-essence of all Buddhas' speech..."

Emaho! The twelve great laughs burst forth from the natural state!
