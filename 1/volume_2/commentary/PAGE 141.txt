The teaching on the two lights of ground path! This shows how the supreme vehicle surpasses all eight lower vehicles.

First aspect: Outer light shines through dharmas—like sun illuminating all appearances. Inner light shines through awareness—like moon reflecting clearly. 

Outer dharmas: When you teach emptiness to beings with limited capacity, you need scriptural presentation—like giving them a map to follow.

Inner awareness: When you point directly to their nature, they realize immediately—like suddenly clearing their vision.

Then natural manifestation: Outer light radiates as display, inner light remains as expanse. Outer movement animates as beneficial activity, inner movement remains as stillness.

This shows Dzogchen contains both gradual paths of sutras and mantra paths of vajrayana—it's not limited to one approach.

Emaho! Two lights—one illumination, one reflection!
