[1503-1515] Listen here, friend! From the sutras we learn: ka, by not-born, all dharmas' door is thus—each word, each letter, each meaning applies and explains. But in some new tantras, the explanation of letter sounds also has faults in how it arises. If you think there's no difference between mantra and free translation, you're mistaken!

From the sutra treatises: briefly-explained, extensively-explained, and meaning-summarized—threefold application—and in those too, faults are observed. The nature-complete Great Completion tantras' instruction-tantras are easy to understand; each letter is spoken to be easy to understand. Great panditas, knowing each language correctly, attained realization; through their self-translation, they established difficult-to-understand expanse letters and sounds, translating and arranging them mistake-free and easy to understand. A translator endowed with kindness surpasses others. Thus the five wisdoms, from individually separate, become twenty-five, and with distinction parts as explained before—finished.

[1516-1544] The fourth meaning: enlightened-activity distinction in three aspects—four kinds of enlightened-activity essence briefly explained, nature complete manner progressively extensively explained, self-appearance dawn manner kind meaning summarized.

First, in essence: definite-word, distinction, mudra, deity-assembly, essence, mandala—and from these seven. The enlightened-activity essence meaning twofold spontaneously complete: wisdom essence dwells itself. From Rang-shar: all enlightened-activity wisdom, all actions do. From that: enlightened-activity buddha itself is called, action wisdom experience takes, enlightened-activity self itself speaks, from I arisen and I complete, complete ground likewise.

Distinction four: also from that—pacifying and enriching and likewise power and fierce are regarded.

Emaho! Four enlightened activities spontaneously complete! Don't think you need to add anything. All accomplishing is already accomplished in the nature of mind itself!
