Look here! You think you're human because you're special? No! You're here because of three poisons—desire, aversion, delusion. From desire impure, you ripened as birds. Yes! The bird form loves to talk, loves objects, delights in desire. When ripening into body, speech becomes chief. This isn't cosmology—this is your own mind's patterns. Do you love to chatter? Do you make objects your chief concern? That's the bird nature in you.

[4574-4577]
But listen! That very tendency can become the path. The sambhogakaya posture takes that speech-desire and transforms it into connection with dharmata's meaning. Those who always perform this posture become supreme experts—not in words, but in reality itself. Your affliction becomes your awakening. Don't you see?

[4578-4584]
From delusion impure, the pig form emerges. This is the mind-chief form—when ripening, mind changes constantly, intellect shifts, conceptuality runs wild. Not delighting in speech, always delighting in sleep. Sound familiar? The dharmakaya posture takes this very tendency and stabilizes it in dharmata for all three times. Your sleepiness becomes meditation!

[4585-4591]
From aversion impure, the snake form emerges. Body action chief—loving movement, coarse body, delighting in grooming. The nirmanakaya posture takes this restlessness and transforms it into buddhahood. Three postures for three poisons. Three doors out of samsara. No more needed. No less will do.

[4592-4596]
Emaho! Your very afflictions are the raw material for awakening. Don't reject them—transform them!
