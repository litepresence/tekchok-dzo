[6314-6333]
From Ratnakuta Sutra: Tathagatas always arise—non-dharmas! All dharmas like Sugata! Childish intellects grasp characteristics, therefore in the world, practice dharmas that don't exist!

From King Samadhi Sutra: When this world arises, arises and ceases, abiding emptiness—just as before, so after! Know all dharmas thus!

From Arya Ratnakuta Sutra: Ignorance like space! All dharmas characteristic-less! No support, no ground, no grasping! Like illusion—know completely!

See? The Buddha taught that all these things we think are real are like space, like illusions! Don't grasp at them like they're solid!

Emaho! All dharmas—like space, like illusion!
