[6314-6320] Listen, dear practitioner! From the Condensed Sutra: "Tathagatas always arisen, non-existing dharmas, all dharmas blissfully gone like! Childish intellect grasps characteristics, world engages in non-existing dharmas!"

[6321-6326] Also from King of Samadhi Sutra: "When this world arises, arises then ceases, abiding empty—know all dharmas thus! Middle beyond extremes, aspects perfectly clear, completely luminosity!"

[6327-6333] From Jeweled Heap Sutra: "Non-arisen dharmas not-ceased, nature thus completely clear! No objective-reference, no characteristics, no name, no definition—example and expression also exhausted!"

Do you see? All these sutras are pointing to the same truth—dharmas do not arise! You search for arising, but nothing ever arose. You fear ceasing, but nothing ever ceases. Rest in the non-arisen!

Emaho! The ultimate truth of non-arising!
