Listen, fortunate one! Space-awareness familiar ones [14161-14180], dying where snow or rock cave or without people, mind-distracting conditions not existing, crucial. Shantideva: "Dwellers nearby whoever, not grieving; this one Buddha-recollection, etc., no one becomes distracted."

Second: as before shown, transference crucial done [14181-14200]—wind consciousness entering, life-wind from heart's place moving time, this is the time. Rigpa from heart directed at own guru's kaya-colors, hi-gi sound seven or twenty-one to Brahma-opening thrown, ka-dag's ground instantly zangthal liberation.

Sun-Moon Union [14201-14220]: "Four winds gradually ceasing, great wind moving time; consciousness wind-mounted, wind trained; that above matured is crucial; rigpa gathering and throwing crucial; that too hi-gi throwing; that very guru's face meeting."

Rigpa's wisdom wind consciousness entering time [14221-14240], here transference, instructions here clearly pointed out. Sun-Moon Union: "Then guru's instructions, own mind familiarized; these meanings clearly point out."

Breath-transference time [14241-14260], entering object and place—transference; entering kaya and wisdom—space-awareness instruction. Two; also in space-awareness, familiar ones not depending on other conditions, and depending—two explained, thus instructions threefold.

Third: depending on other conditions [14261-14280]—that time guru or vajra sibling, samaya without wavering, clearly points out.

Emaho!
