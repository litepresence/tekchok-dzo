Listen here, you who want to understand the three bodies! Longchenpa now explains how each kaya has its own posture, its own way of abiding. Don't think these are just yoga positions you need to memorize! These are direct pointers to how awareness itself abides in different modes.

Look at the Sambhogakaya posture first. "Relying on elephant lying down" - what does this mean? The elephant represents power and stability, but lying down shows complete relaxation. When you rest in the nature of mind, not trying to achieve anything, all phenomena become "enjoyments" - pure displays of wisdom. The lotus eye sees everything directly because there's no effort involved. When desire objects are purified, you're not getting rid of them - you're seeing they were never real to begin with!

[4511–4525]
Now the Dharmakaya posture - listen carefully! "Golden bird" is the preciousness that flies above all concepts. When awareness abides as dharmakaya, it transcends the three realms automatically. The "lion's den" isn't a cave you find in Tibet - it's the fearless abiding where nothing can disturb rigpa. When Longchenpa says "press two foot soles to earth," he's telling you to be grounded in reality itself! Balance the elements - don't favor one over another. Feel the heat of primordial wisdom, not just your body heat!

And here's the secret: the winds! Primordial wisdom wind flows naturally when you stop trying to direct it. Karma wind - the winds of dualistic thinking - suppress themselves when you rest in non-duality. This isn't something you do - it's what happens when you stop doing!

[4526–4540]
Now understand what makes these postures work. The posture isn't physical - it's how awareness holds itself. When your hand "bends finger to earth," you're not doing mudra - you're recognizing that form and emptiness are inseparable. When you "suppress karma wind," you're not fighting thoughts - you're seeing they have no substance.

The lion posture represents fearlessness. When awareness abides as lion, there's no place for delusion to hide. The golden bird represents the spontaneous arising of wisdom - it doesn't need to flap its wings to fly.

All these postures point to one thing: stop trying to posture your mind! Let awareness rest in its natural state, and the three kayas will manifest naturally.

Do you see? Don't imitate the form - understand the meaning!

Emaho! Your own nature has been posturing perfectly all along!
