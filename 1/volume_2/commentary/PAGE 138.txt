[5830-5833] Listen, dear practitioner! Extremely elaborate all near ceased, not-existing—empowerment! This also example faith, meaning's certainty! Also body's base is four elements' binding, liberating-released arising. Now elements self-nature return not-possible—main point!

[5834-5838] Speech's four: express-basis, express-condition, express-object, express-agent—four bindings liberated from. Now word self-nature say not-possible!

[5839-5844] Mind's four: mindfulness, no-mindfulness, unborn, intellect-transcended—four bindings liberated from. Now think naturally not-established!

[5858-5872] Thus empowerment four as example, faith by meaning thig-decided. Meaning: body, speech, mind, all dharmas, wind-mind-elaborate-free sphere, luminosity clear gathered!

Do you see? Body cannot be bound by elements! Speech cannot be captured by words! Mind cannot be held by thoughts! You are already empowered!

Emaho! Four empowerments—already complete!
