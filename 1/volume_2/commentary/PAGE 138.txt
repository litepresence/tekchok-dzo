Natural maturation! Everything complete naturally when in non-conceptual meditation.

Seven bhumis: lion throne—vast and primordially pure; precious parasol—adorned; lotus crown—beyond cause and effect; precious wheel—dharma's motion transcends cause-effect; perfect wisdom wheel—spontaneous display; bodhi tree—branches of all paths.

These states arise naturally—like a lake suddenly clearing. They're not achieved through effort but through letting be.

Then qualities of maturation: unstained awareness radiating spontaneously, like sun without clouds. Non-conceptual wisdom knowing all vehicles naturally, like space containing everything.

Then ultimate maturation: all vehicles' practices complete in this non-conceptual awareness—like thousands of rivers flowing into one ocean.

Finally, Dzogchen's special feature: All vehicles' paths accomplish in this very lifetime, not taking multiple rebirths, like rain falling on mountain summit—all paths wet at once.

Emaho! Non-conceptual—effortless, complete!
