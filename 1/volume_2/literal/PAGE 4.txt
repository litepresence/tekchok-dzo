[173] The wisdom of awareness is joined with [that which is] devoid of birth and cessation.
[174] Also the characteristic of wind—being that which elevates.
[175] The wisdom of awareness is joined with unobstructedness.
[176] Also the characteristic of fire—being that which burns.
[177] The wisdom of awareness is joined with having come under the power of afflictions.
[178] Also the characteristic of water—being that which moistens.
[179] The wisdom of awareness is joined with engaging all objects.
[180] Also the characteristic of space—being that which is expansive.
[181] The characteristic of awareness should be joined with unbroken continuity; thus it is said.
[182] The eighth: the manner of liberation of the five elements.
[183] From the Pearl Garland:
[184] Space itself, through pervading and emptiness,
[185] Space itself is liberated as thing.
[186] Wind, through appearing without grasped object,
[187] Is liberated as the action of gathering things.
[188] Fire, through maturing and consuming,
[189] Is liberated as stirring and distinguishing pure and impure.
[190] Earth, when producing and elevating,
[191] Is liberated as emptiness, limitless, without things.
[192] Water, through gathering and moistening,
[193] Is liberated as the action of burning and maturing.
[194] Thus it is.
[195] Analyzing the elements:
[196] The five elements, each one—earth of vast earth and so forth—five sets of five,
[197] Making twenty-five in number.
[198] Again from that same [source]:
[199] The wind of space [acts] upon things.
[200] The fire of space gathers.
[201] The water of space burns.
[202] The earth of space opens opportunities.
[203] The space of space is appearance.
[204] The wind of wind [acts] upon stability.
[205] The space of wind is great innate radiance.
[206] The water of wind is great speed.
[207] The fire of wind is great attraction and gathering.
[208] The earth of wind is clear form-image.
[209] The water of water is sound-echo.
[210] The space of water is unobstructed.
[211] The wind of water flows without attachment.
[212] The fire of water gathers.
[213] The earth of water pervades.
[214] The earth of fire produces.
[215] The space of fire burns things.
[216] The wind of fire makes blaze.
[217] The water of fire destroys.
[218] The earth of fire is holding.
[219] The earth of earth pervades sentient beings.
[220] The space of earth is the Great Vehicle.
[221] The wind of earth empties snow [mountains].
[222] The water of earth produces things.
[223] The fire of earth is drying.
[224] Thus it is.
[225] Having trained in the distinctions of these, each special quality is accomplished, as explained in its commentary.
