[979] The clearly radiant mandalas of each of the five families, unmixed.
[980] From Self-Arising:
[981] Possessing individual marks, colors unmixed.
[982] Marks and excellent examples, blazing light-rays.
[983] Possessing the attire of father, mother, and body.
[984] The characteristics of the Perfected Enjoyment Body.
[985] Thus it is.
[986] Fourth, the mode of appearance:
[987] From one awareness-essence,
[988] From the expanse-body, light-bodies spread to the ten directions, accomplishing benefit,
[989] The awareness-body unmoving from the expanse, without change or transformation, self-appearance in the field of luminosity—two complete, appearing outwardly and inwardly.
[990] From that same [source]:
[991] One essence, two essences,
[992] The appearance of Perfected Enjoyment.
[993] Thus it is.
[994] Fifth, the mode of abiding: expanse without accepting or rejecting.
[995] Non-dual space.
[996] The vast expanse of the five perfected lights.
[997] Abiding as the great continuum of emanation spreading.
[998] From Self-Arising:
[999] Without true production and without reference.
[1000] Without mind of entering and liberation.
[1001] How could there be grasping and conduct?
[1002] Transcending words of attachment and fixation.
[1003] Transcending the two: what is to be abandoned and the abandoner.
[1004] Transcending object, mind, and intellect.
[1005] Without reference to object,
[1006] Self-appearance, decisive expression, appearance.
[1007] Liberation in its own place without grasping.
[1008] Emanating in the ten directions.
[1009] In the pure appearance of reference-objects,
[1010] Innate wisdom arises all-at-once.
[1011] In the appearance of objects without reference,
[1012] Marks self-liberate.
[1013] From that, emanations arise extensively.
[1014] Thus it is.
[1015] Third, the extensive explanation of the Emanation Body's ground has five:
[1016] Essence,
[1017] Definitive meaning,
[1018] Characteristics,
[1019] Divisions,
[1020] And methods of examination.
[1021] First, the Emanation Body's essence: from the expanse and awareness-body, spreading as light-body and so forth, accomplishing others' benefit.
[1022] The definitive meaning:
[1023] From Self-Arising:
[1024] Know that these are the definitive meanings of the Emanation Body.
[1025] Because appearing suitably to the sentient beings of the world, it is the Emanation Body.
[1026] Because capable of accomplishing the benefit of the Emanation Body, it is the Emanation Body.
[1027] Because doing all actions, it is the Emanation Body.
[1028] Because capable of liberating into the expanse those sentient beings beyond number, it is the Emanation Body.
[1029] Because remaining for a short time in one field, it is the Emanation Body.
[1030] Because compassion arises without direction, it is the Emanation Body.
[1031] Because fierce and wrathful, it is the Emanation Body.
[1032] Because peaceful and certain, it is the Emanation Body.
[1033] Because seen as beautiful by beings, it is the Emanation Body.
[1034] Thus it is.
[1035] Third, the characteristics:
