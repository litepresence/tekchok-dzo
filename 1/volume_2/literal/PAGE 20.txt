[1036] Accomplishing the two benefits of those to be tamed.
[1037] From that same [source]:
[1038] The characteristic of the Emanation Body:
[1039] Accomplishing what is to be accomplished.
[1040] Considered as two types.
[1041] Thus it is.
[1042] Although divisions are generally taught as nature-emanation, taming-beings-emanation, and so forth,
[1043] Here, regarding the accomplishment of the two purposes,
[1044] The Emanation Body of accomplishing actions,
[1045] And the Emanation Body of performing actions—two are asserted.
[1046] The Emanation Body of spontaneously established self-benefit, accomplishing actions:
[1047] Completing the gate of spontaneous self-appearance in this life or the intermediate state,

[1060] When dissolving into the expanse, the pure gate of spontaneous presence, nirvana,
[1061] It is called "Buddha's nirvana."
[1062] This is crucial for all who possess wisdom.
[1063] Then, that emptiness appearing for establishing self-benefit is the Emanation Body, self-arising from oneself, liberating into the expanse; thus it is called the Emanation Body of accomplishing actions.
[1064] From Self-Arising:
[1065] The Emanation Body of accomplishing actions:
[1066] Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly Buddha.
[1067] Then emanating.
[1068] Outer and inner actions accomplished.
[1069] Considered as the Emanation Body of accomplishing actions.
