[807] The spontaneously present great original liberation fruition.
[808] The activity of perfecting all meanings originally established.
[809] Qualities abiding in oneself without seeking.
[810] Again from that same [source]:
[811] Unceasing, without fixation, without attachment—
[812] The conduct of the Dharma-body.
[813] Clear, unobstructed, without distraction—
[814] The meditation of the Dharma-body.
[815] Without seeing, the view of seeing is complete—
[816] The view of the Dharma-body.
[817] Without making, without arising, without production—
[818] The fruition of the Dharma-body.
[819] Without cultivation, the cultivation of accomplishment is complete—
[820] The activity of the Dharma-body.
[821] One arising, two arising, all arising—
[822] The qualities of the Dharma-body.
[823] Thus it is.
[824] The second: the extensive explanation of the Perfected Body's ground has five:
[825] Essence,
[826] Definitive meaning,
[827] Characteristics,
[828] Mode of appearance,
[829] Mode of abiding.
[830] First:
[831] From Self-Arising:
[832] There is birth—possessing the deathless vajra.
[833] The five lights, the body unobscured, individually clear.
[834] Possessing the five fathers, five objects, five aggregates.
[835] Possessing the five innate [aspects], five wisdoms, five realizations.
[836] Possessing the five bases, five paths, five fruitions.
[837] Possessing the five abodes, five objects, five essences.
[838] The essence of the Enjoyment Body.
[839] Thus it is.
[840] Although from the perspective of arising as self-appearance from the expanse, birth is asserted,
[841] In reality there is no birth possessing self-characteristics, thus no death, because the demon of death is conquered.
[842] Also from the Lion's Perfected Power:
[843] Without inside, inside is the precious jewel treasury.
[844] The innate wisdom transcends all elements.
[845] Realization's prajna transforms in reality.
[846] In the vast body, outer and inner clearly appear.
[847] Thus it is.
[848] The five lights are: deep blue,
[849] White,
[850] Yellow,
[851] Red,
[852] And green.
[853] The five bodies are:
[854] The body of the nature of the expanse,
[855] The unchanging vajra body,
[856] The Dharma-body,
[857] The Enjoyment Body,
[858] And the five Emanation Bodies.
[859] The five fathers are:
[860] Vairochana,
[861] Akshobhya,
[862] Ratnasambhava,
[863] And the five Amoghasiddhis.
[864] The five mothers are:
[865] Akashadhatvishvari.
