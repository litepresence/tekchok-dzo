[866] Buddha-Locana,
[867] Mamaki,
[868] White-Clad [Pandaravasini],
[869] And the five Samaya-Taras.
[870] The five aggregates are:
[871] The five such as Akshobhya each surrounded by five, beautifully encircled by the light-rays of the five peripheries.
[872] The five innate [aspects] are:
[873] The five paths, originally perfect.
[874] The five bodies, originally established.
[875] Awareness, originally arising.
[876] The five lights, originally radiant.
[877] Stain, originally pure.
[878] The five wisdoms are:
[879] From the measure of realization:
[880] Knowing as five bodies,
[881] Knowing as five wisdoms,
[882] Knowing as five lights,
[883] Knowing as self-appearance,
[884] Knowing as the great liberation from extremes without duality.
[885] The five realizations are:
[886] Realizing the object as expanse.
[887] Realizing birth and going as body.
[888] Realizing appearance as light.
[889] Realizing arising and liberation without partiality.
[890] Realizing prajna as awareness.
[891] The five bases are:
[892] The basis of luminosity: awareness.
[893] The basis of things: universal ground.
[894] The basis of delusion: mind.
[895] The basis of the path: lamp.
[896] The basis of conceptualization: prajna.
[897] The five paths are:
[898] The common: path of accumulation.
[899] Path of application.
[900] Path of seeing.
[901] Path of meditation.
[902] And the five paths of no-more-learning.
[903] The five uncommon paths are:
[904] The path of reality: expanse.
[905] The path of awareness: knowing.
[906] The path of luminosity: the two lamps.
[907] The path of Cutting Through: arising-liberation.
[908] The path of Direct Crossing: expanse-awareness.
[909] The five fruitions are:
[910] The fruition of wisdom: liberation into family.
[911] The fruition of light: delusory appearance subsiding.
[912] The fruition of realization: delusory thought purified.
[913] The fruition of self-appearance: arriving at the place of exhaustion.
[914] The fruition of ultimate limit: dissolving into the expanse.
[915] The five abodes are:
[916] The abode of bindu: heart.
[917] The abode of wisdom: crown.
[918] The abode of lamp: eye.
[919] The abode of expanse-appearance: space.
[920] The abode of liberation-place: primordial purity.
[921] The five objects are:
[922] The object of awareness: expanse.
[923] The object of lamp: space.
[924] The object of wisdom: intermediate state.
[925] The object of light: self-appearance.
[926] The object of Enjoyment Body: aggregates.
[927] The five essences are:
[928] The essence of awareness: primordial purity.
[929] The essence of wisdom: spontaneous presence.
[930] The essence of light: the fivefold.
[931] The essence of prajna: realization.
[932] The essence of lamp: empty luminosity.
[933] Thus appearing as five sets, some are the heart-essence of the Enjoyment Body.
