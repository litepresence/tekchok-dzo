[57] outer-arising expansive explanation and
[58] inner-arising expansive explanation
[59] first to
[60] essence
[61] definitive-terminology
[62] purpose
[63] characteristics
[64] function-sequence
[65] dharma-nature
[66] meaning-application
[67] liberation-manner
[68] division
[69] completeness-manner and tenfold
[70] first essence is
[71] outer-arising form-as appearance inner-arising actuality-genitive play is-because
[72] inner-genitive category-within gather therefore five-arising
[73] self-arisen from
[74] outer-arising this-thus
[75] earth and water and fire and
[76] likewise wind and space
[77] thus stated
[78] outer-arising five-form sentient-being-genitive support-container-genitive appearance become
[79] inner-arising actuality-genitive five mind and awareness-genitive support become
[80] thal-gyur from
[81] arising-genitive assertion this-thus
[82] general-common karma-genitive particularities-from
[83] sentient-being karma-genitive support individual-by
[84] outer-arising-upon rely
[85] karma and sustenance and faculty and
[86] entourage and birth complete assert
[87] thus
[88] second definitive-terminology
[89] self-arisen from
[90] arising-genitive definitive-terminology this-thus
[91] fabrication-by not-arisen spontaneous-completion
[92] producing action-by arising is
[93] migrating-being all pervade-by great-arising is
[94] simultaneous birth-by great-arising is
[95] self-in exist-by great-arising is
[96] change not-exist-by great-arising is
[97] harmonious appear-by great-arising is
[98] great-arising-genitive definitive-terminology likewise
[99] thus
[100] third purpose
[101] thal-gyur from
[102] arising-genitive purpose inquiry this-thus
[103] water clear-essence gather and
[104] impurities separate action
[105] individual body-within act therefore
[106] purpose hot and cold know
[107] earth foundation hold and
[108] establish coherent action do
[109] ripening-by root etcetera produce
[110] purpose relative thigle know
[111] fire arising increase and
[112] ripening clarity action do
[113] blazing spreading-by eye etcetera produce
[114] purpose warmths know make
[115] wind scatter lift and
[116] move quiver action do
[117] move tremble-by body hold
[118] purpose mind-genitive abode know
[119] four-arising self great-mandala
[120] body etcetera accomplish cause make
[121] middle abide hold action
[122] end destroy action all do
[123] great-arising cause one-by
[124] various doer master appear
[125] thus intention self and other
[126] action complete meaning skilled
[127] thus
[128] fourth characteristics five-from
[129] earth-characteristic solidity
