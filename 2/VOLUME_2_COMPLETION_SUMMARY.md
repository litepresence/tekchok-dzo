## VOICE PATTERNS

### Longchenpa (Bridge):
```
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. 
Like [metaphor], the teaching appears and self-liberates. 
Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.
```

### Patrul (Earthy):
```
This old fool... watched [metaphor]. Nothing special. Just [X] being [X]. 
Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.
```

### First Point (Direct but spacious):
```
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. 
Like [metaphor]—complete in itself, needing nothing added.
```

### Lotus-Born (Visionary):
```
In the space of awareness... [Metaphor]. 
The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. 
The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as [metaphor].
```

### Lion-Faced (Fierce yet spacious):
```
This very hesitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? 
The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. 
Like [metaphor]—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.
```
