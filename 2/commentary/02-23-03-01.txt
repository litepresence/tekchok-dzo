See what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like marmot whistling across alpine meadow—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The first bardo of clear light is not after death—it is the clear light of this awareness, seen when fixation drops. The second bardo of dharmata is not a vision but the display of mind's nature, always present, usually obscured. The third bardo of becoming is not rebirth but the continuation of not-recognizing, moment by moment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[6-10]
Therefore. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsTrying to understand prevents the understanding that is always present.

Recognition in the bardo is not different from recognition now. The only difference is urgency: now we can afford to pretend we have time; in the bardo, the pretense drops away. But the recognition is the same—the seeing that awareness has never been born and never dies.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
Spontaneously arising. Thunder echoing through empty valley. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as thunder echoing through empty valley.

The instructions for the bardo are instructions for this moment. 'Do not fear the deities' means do not fear your own nature. 'Recognize the clear light' means recognize this awareness, unobscured by fixation. 'Rest without distraction' means rest now, not later.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Clarity emerges. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksThis instant of experience is the only scripture needed.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[21-25]
Heart to heart. Stream finding path through moraineThe teaching describes what is as free as ice cracking on frozen lake.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This old fool. watched wildflowers blooming above tree line. Nothing special. Just line being line. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[36-40]
Spontaneous presence. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofJust as mushroom emerging overnight needs no instruction to arise, this nature is self-existing.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[41-45]
No need for complexity. Wind-carved clouds above plateauWhat is called confusion is wisdom not recognizing itself.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Precise analysis reveals. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe aggregates that bind are the display that liberates.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[51-55]
The expanse of. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedWhat seeks recognition is already recognized in the seeking.

What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[56-60]
Natural perfection. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[61-65]
Sky-like nature. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThe wisdom described is not acquired but acknowledged.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[66-70]
Rest, simply rest. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThis verse reveals what is as vast as heart beating without decision.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[71-75]
The yogini knows. Hailstones drumming on tin roofLike river cutting canyon over eons, recognition cannot be forced, only allowed.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[81-85]
Dancing in space. Thunder echoing through empty valleyLike breath moving without command, awareness requires no support to exist.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity.

[91-95]
Natural delight. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windWhat is taught is the unteachable nature of awareness.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[96-100]
Fierce compassion reveals. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like rhododendron blooming in cloud forest—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities.

Intensity without aggression. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable.

Sudden recognition! Like rainbow arching over nomad tents—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.
