See what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like thunder echoing through empty valley—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

Pure lands are not destinations for the dead but descriptions of recognition's clarity for the living. Sukhavati is not west but wherever mind is unobscured—this room, this breath, this awareness reading these words. The pure land is not elsewhere; it is the purification of elsewhere.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Pure lands are not destinations but descriptions of recognition's clarity.

Thus established. Constellation rotating around north starThe texture of experience now is the Dzogchen view.

The five Buddha families are not celestial beings but aspects of recognition: Vairocana (center) is the space of awareness, Akshobhya (east) is the mirror of mind, Ratnasambhava (south) is the equality of all phenomena, Amitabha (west) is the discrimination of wisdom, Amoghasiddhi (north) is the accomplishment of spontaneous benefit. Five aspects, one recognition.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

In the space of awareness. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven mill. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

To be born in a pure land is not a future event but the birth of recognition in this moment. The lotus seat is the heart opening, the Buddha field is the field of awareness, the retinue is the display of thoughts recognized as wisdom. You are already there—only the belief in being elsewhere obscures it.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as mantra wheels spinning in water-driven mill.

Between this and that. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe nature of this moment is the nature (rang bzhin) of all moments.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Sukhavati is not west but wherever mind is unobscured.

[7-7]
Intimate recognition. Wind-carved clouds above plateauLike perfume rising from unseen flowers, awareness requires no support to exist.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[8-9]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.
