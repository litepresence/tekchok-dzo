[1-5]
Recognition is immediate. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like yak bells clanking at dusk—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The first bardo of clear light is not after death—it is the clear light of this awareness, seen when fixation drops. The second bardo of dharmata is not a vision but the display of mind's nature, always present, usually obscured. The third bardo of becoming is not rebirth but the continuation of not-recognizing, moment by moment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[6-10]
Consequently. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

Recognition in the bardo is not different from recognition now. The only difference is urgency: now we can afford to pretend we have time; in the bardo, the pretense drops away. But the recognition is the same—the seeing that awareness has never been born and never dies.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
In the space of awareness. Stream finding path through moraine. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as stream finding path through moraine.

The instructions for the bardo are instructions for this moment. 'Do not fear the deities' means do not fear your own nature. 'Recognize the clear light' means recognize this awareness, unobscured by fixation. 'Rest without distraction' means rest now, not later.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
The distinction illuminates. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[21-25]
The feminine principle. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeThis verse speaks of what is as uncaused as sound fading into silence.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like distant glacier calving into turquoise lake, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This old fool. watched glacier melting into high-altitude lake. Nothing special. Just lake being lake. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[36-40]
The unity appears. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe aggregates that bind are the display that liberates.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
Rest, simply rest. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millLike moon pulling tides without effort, awareness requires no support to exist.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[46-50]
The melody of. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windYour immediate awareness is the treasury Longchenpa reveals.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[51-55]
Heart recognition. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThe confusion about the meaning is itself luminous clarity.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[56-61]
The tradition holds. Constellation rotating around north starThe view is viewed by the view itself, leaving no viewer.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[62-66]
This hermit. watched dust devils swirling across dry lakebed. Nothing special. Just lakebed being lakebed. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[67-71]
Spontaneous display. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksWhat appears in these words is as primordial as heat rising from sun-warmed stone.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[72-76]
The visionary sees. Thunder echoing through empty valley. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as thunder echoing through empty valley.

[77-81]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[82-86]
Enough. Yak bells clanking at duskThe texture of experience now is the Dzogchen view.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[87-91]
Secret whisper. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe Dzogchen view is not a view to adopt but the nature (rang bzhin) to recognize.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[92-96]
The expanse of. Stream finding path through moraineThe distinction between deluded and liberated mind dissolves here.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[97-101]
The play of bliss. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThis passage invites the recognition of primordial completeness.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[102-106]
With devotion. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeYour present wakefulness is Samantabhadra's enlightenment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[107-111]
This hermit. watched snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream. Nothing special. Just stream being stream. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

[112-117]
Precise analysis reveals. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windThis passage describes your own nature, though words can only gesture toward it.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash.

[118-122]
The phrase reveals. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe meaning here is as luminous as aurora dancing without dancer.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[128-132]
As taught in. Constellation rotating around north starThe nature described is as unchanging as breath moving without command yet ever-fresh.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[133-137]
Vajra nature. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsLike sand dune shaped by nameless wind, recognition cannot be forced, only allowed.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[138-142]
What is needed? Nothing. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThe teaching describes what is as free as spring water bubbling from earth.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains.

Natural perfection. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe teaching offers recognition, not information.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[148-152]
Wisdom words. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe teaching describes what is as free as pearl growing in hidden oyster.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities.
