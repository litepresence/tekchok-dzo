[1-5]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like prayer flags snapping in mountain wind—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The summary is not conclusion but beginningless recognition restated. All that has been said points to what cannot be said. The finger has pointed; the moon is visible. Words end where recognition begins—or rather, words reveal that they are recognition's display, never separate from what they describe.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The summary is not conclusion but beginningless recognition.

[6-10]
Analysis proceeds. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThe nature described cannot be contaminated or purified.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began. The treasury closes by opening, ends by beginning, summarizes by expanding. The teaching is complete when the student recognizes the teacher is their own mind, the text is their own display, the meaning is their own nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The play of appearance. Wind-carved clouds above plateau. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as wind-carved clouds above plateau.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition—or the recognition that the book never started and will never end, appearing to begin and end only for those who need the comfort of frames, of starts and finishes, of stories with morals. The moral is: there is no moral, only what is.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Precise analysis reveals. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThe nature described here is as effortless as clouds forming and dissolving.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began.

[21-25]
Heart to heart. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThe space in which these words arise is the nature (rang bzhin) described.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This mountain dweller. watched juniper smoke rising from monastery roof. Nothing special. Just roof being roof. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The treasury closes by opening; the text ends by beginning.

[36-40]
All dissolves into. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe present experience cannot be separated from primordial wisdom.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
No need for complexity. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeWhat is taught here is not new knowledge but ancient recognition.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[46-50]
The texts say. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millWhat seeks recognition is already recognized in the seeking.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The summary is not conclusion but beginningless recognition.

[51-55]
The unity appears. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe Dzogchen view is not a view to adopt but the nature (rang bzhin) to recognize.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[56-60]
Does it have a root? Look. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like marmot whistling across alpine meadow—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[61-65]
In practice. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestWhat is taught is the unteachable nature of awareness.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began.

[66-70]
Plainly speaking. Stone cairn marking mountain passWhat is pointed to is as ordinary yet extraordinary as honey forming in dark hive.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[71-75]
The diamond point. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[76-80]
Concealed wisdom. Eagle circling on thermal updraftWhat is taught here is not new knowledge but ancient recognition.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

The treasury closes by opening; the text ends by beginning.

[81-85]
Spontaneous joy. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe treasury reveals what is as self-existing as sound fading into silence.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[86-90]
Opening naturally. Stream finding path through moraineWhat is pointed to is as ordinary yet extraordinary as mushroom emerging overnight.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[91-95]
To put it clearly. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverWhat is taught here is as unconstructed as sand dune shaped by nameless wind.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The summary is not conclusion but beginningless recognition.

[96-100]
The framework reveals. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricSamsara and nirvana are not different in this nature.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[101-105]
Language points. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe wisdom described is not acquired but acknowledged.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[106-110]
Clarity emerges. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeThe aggregates that bind are the display that liberates.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began.

[111-115]
The expanse of. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[116-120]
Words translate. Thunder echoing through empty valleyYour immediate awareness is the treasury Longchenpa reveals.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[126-130]
Enough. Stone cairn marking mountain passLike fog lifting from valley floor, awareness requires no support to exist.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[131-135]
This very hesitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends.

Between this and that. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowThe path is traversed by realizing there is no path.

Harmonious view. Hailstones drumming on tin roofWhat you are now is what all verses describe.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure.

The middle way opens. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverThis passage describes what is as undefiled as river cutting canyon over eons.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began.

With devotion. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamLook at your own mind right now—this is what is meant.

The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[161-165]
Sudden recognition! Like prayer flags snapping in mountain wind—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[176-180]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like stream finding path through moraine—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment.

Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[266-270]
Opening naturally. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThis passage describes what is as undefiled as sand dune shaped by nameless wind.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[271-275]
No separation exists. Eagle circling on thermal updraftWhat appears in these lines is the self-liberated nature of all phenomena.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began.

[276-280]
The expanse of. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe struggle to grasp this is spontaneous self-liberation.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[281-285]
Simply stated. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThe meaning here is as luminous as clouds forming and dissolving.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[286-290]
Mighty understanding. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowWhat is spoken here unspeaks the one who speaks.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The treasury closes by opening; the text ends by beginning.

[291-295]
The tradition holds. Yak bells clanking at duskRecognition happens when the recognizer is recognized as empty.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[296-300]
The play of bliss. Stream finding path through moraineThere is no meditation to do, only recognition to allow.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[301-305]
Fierce compassion reveals. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like sunrise painting eastern snow peaks—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[306-310]
Simply this. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThis passage speaks of what is as empty yet apparent as mountain shadows shifting with the sun.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[311-315]
Powerful insight. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash.

[316-320]
Wisdom words. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millDzogchen recognition is as natural as pearl growing in hidden oyster—always happening.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The summary is not conclusion but beginningless recognition.

[321-325]
Direct experience. Stone cairn marking mountain passLongchenpa's words point beyond themselves to direct experience.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended.

With devotion. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe meaning here is as luminous as sand dune shaped by nameless wind.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Simply stated. Constellation rotating around north starThe experience of reading these words is itself the teaching.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is summarized was never divided; what is concluded never began.

Enough. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

Simply this. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverThe awareness that feels confused has never been confused.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure.

In practice. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowThe treasury reveals that there is nothing to reveal.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Simply this. Stream finding path through moraineThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.
