[1-5]
The path (lam) is not a sequence to traverse but stages of recognition. Each 'level' is actually a different way of seeing the same ground. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

The ten bhumis are ten degrees of forgetting. First bhumi: recognition dawns but habits remain. Second: recognition deepens, habits tremble. By the tenth, habits are like mist in morning sun—present but insubstantial. But the sun was always shining; the mist only seemed to obscure.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The bhumis are not achievements but degrees of obscuration removed.

[6-10]
The stages (sa/bhumi) are not rungs on a ladder but descriptions of recognition's clarity. This is the treasury's heart.

Each bhumi is not a level attained but a layer of obscuration removed. The 'progress' is actually regression—returning to what was never departed from. The first bhumi recognizes; the tenth recognizes that recognition was never necessary.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. As natural as breathing.

[11-15]
In the space of awareness. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaks. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as sunrise painting eastern snow peaks.

Meditation (sgom) is the joke of the path—trying to achieve what is already present through effort that assumes absence. True meditation is non-meditation: the recognition that the meditator is the final obstacle, the meditation itself the final bondage.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
What is called 'cultivation' is actually the dissolving of the cultivator. This is the treasury's heart.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. As effortless as water being wet.

First bhumi to tenth—like cleaning successive layers of dust from a mirror.

[21-25]
Seeing in Dzogchen is not visual perception but the self-seeing of awareness. This is the treasury's heart.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Like waking from sleep.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
The path (lam) is not a sequence to traverse but stages of recognition. Each level is actually a different way of seeing the same ground. Like finding you were never lost.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The path is traversed by the one who realizes there is no traverser.

[36-40]
The stages (sa/bhumi) are not rungs on a ladder but descriptions of recognition's clarity. Recognition is immediate.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. effortless, like water being wet.

[41-45]
Meditation here is not practice but the natural continuum of recognition. As when realizing you were never asleep.alled 'cultivation' is actually the dissolving of the cultivator. As natural as breathing.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[51-55]
Seeing in Dzogchen is not visual perception but the self-seeing of awareness. Recognition is immediate.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Like finding you were never lost.

The bhumis are not achievements but degrees of obscuration removed.

Realization is not an achievement but the recognition of what was never unrealized. Recognition is immediate.

What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. effortless, like water being wet.

[61-65]
The path (lam) is not a sequence to traverse but stages of recognition. Each level is actually a different way of seeing the same ground. Like the morning sun dispelling night.esitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like stream finding path through moraine—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

[71-75]
Sudden recognition! Like distant glacier calving into turquoise lake—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

Meditation here is not practice but the natural continuum of recognition. Recognition is immediate.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Like finding you were never lost.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Realization is not an achievement but the recognition of what was never unrealized. This is the treasury's heart.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Beyond all dimensions: The path (lam) is not a sequence to traverse but stages of recognition. This is the treasury's heart.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The stages (sa/bhumi) are not rungs on a ladder but descriptions of recognition's clarity. As effortless as water being wet.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Meditation here is not practice but the natural continuum of recognition. The nature is complete.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.
