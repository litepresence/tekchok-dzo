[1-5]
The bardo is not between death and birth—it is this very moment of not recognizing. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

The bardo of dying is this very moment—experience dissolving, grasping releasing, the fixation on body and self dropping away. The clear light dawns not after death but in every gap between thoughts, in every moment of letting go. Death is the ultimate letting go; recognition is letting go without dying.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The bardo of dying is this very moment of experience dissolving.

[6-10]
The moment of death reveals what has always been true: awareness is unborn. Rest in this understanding.

The peaceful and wrathful deities are not beings you meet but your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit. They are terrifying or beautiful according to your relationship with your own nature. Embrace them, and they are saviors; fear them, and they are demons. Both are your own face.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. As natural as breathing.

[11-15]
In the space of awareness. Constellation rotating around north star. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as constellation rotating around north star.

Dharmata is not a state to achieve but the nature of whatever appears, seen without the filter of fixation. The sounds, lights, and rays are rigpa's own luminescence returning home, like waves recognizing they are water. The recognition in the bardo is the same recognition now—only now we call it 'practice.'

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Dharmata is not a state to achieve but the nature (rang bzhin) of whatever appears. As effortless as water being wet.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Dharmata appears terrifying only to the one still grasping at form.

[21-25]
The experiences of the bardo are mind's own display—terrifying or beautiful according to habit. Recognition is immediate.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. Like waking from sleep.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like marmot whistling across alpine meadow, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
The bardo is not between death and birth—it is this very moment of not recognizing. Like finding you were never lost.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The sounds, lights, rays—your own mind's luminosity returning home.

[36-40]
The moment of death reveals what has always been true: awareness is unborn. This is the treasury's heart.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. effortless, like water being wet.

The bardo of existence is not a place but the failure to recognize nature. As when realizing you were never asleep.cognition! Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

[51-55]
The experiences of the bardo are mind's own display—terrifying or beautiful according to habit. Like finding you were never lost.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The bardo of dying is this very moment of experience dissolving.

[56-60]
Self-appearance means these visions are not external—they are your own mind's radiance. This is the treasury's heart.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. effortless, like water being wet.

[91-95]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like sunrise painting eastern snow peaks—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[96-100]
The moment of death reveals what has always been true: awareness is unborn. The nature is complete.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. As effortless as water being wet.

[341-345]
Without hesitation— The bardo of existence is As natural as breathing. This is the treasury's heart.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[351-355]
The experiences of the bardo are mind's own displa Like finding you were never lost. The nature is complete.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[356-360]
This very hesitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like thunder echoing through empty valley—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[361-365]
Rest in: The bardo is Like a dream you forgot you As natural as breathing. This is the treasury's heart.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[371-375]
The bardo of existence is not a place but the failure to recognize nature. Like finding you were never lost.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The sounds, lights, rays—your own mind's luminosity returning home.

[376-380]
Dharmata is not a state to achieve but the nature (rang bzhin) of whatever appears. As effortless as water being wet.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[381-385]
The experiences of the bardo are mind's own display—terrifying or beautiful according to habit. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[386-390]
This very moment— Self-appearance means these visions are not external—they are yo Recognition is immediate.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[391-395]
Immediate seeing! The bardo is not between death As effortless as water being wet.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[401-405]
The bardo of existence is not a place but the failure to recognize nature. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[406-410]
Dharmata is not a state to achieve but the nature (rang bzhin) of whatever appears. The nature is complete.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. As natural as breathing.

The bardo of dying is this very moment of experience dissolving.

[411-415]
In the treasury's view: Like finding you were never lost. This is the treasury's heart.

This hermit realized: Self-appearance means these visions are not external—they are This is the treasury's heart.

The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[421-425]
The bardo is not between death and birth—it is this very moment of not recognizing. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Dharmata appears terrifying only to the one still grasping at form.

[426-430]
The moment of death reveals what has always been true: awareness is unborn. Recognition is immediate.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. As natural as breathing.

[431-435]
The bardo of existence is not a place but the failure to recognize nature. As effortless as water being wet.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana.
