[1-5]
Your own face before parents. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like rainbow arching over nomad tents—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The ground is not a starting point but the ever-present basis that needs no beginning. To say 'primordial' is already too late—there was never a time when the ground was not. To seek the ground is to miss it; to rest without seeking is to find what was never lost.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Ground, path, and fruit are not sequential—they are three ways of describing one recognition.

[6-10]
Analysis proceeds. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe struggle to grasp this is spontaneous self-liberation.

The path appears only for the one who believes in distance. The ground and fruit are not endpoints of a journey—they are the same recognition viewed through delusion (ground), the clearing of delusion (path), and the recognition that delusion never existed (fruit). Three names, one nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The play of appearance. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

Fruit is not an achievement but the recognition that there was never anything to achieve. The Buddha-field is not a destination but the field of awareness when fixation drops. Sukhavati is not west but wherever recognition dawns—here, now, in this very thought.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents.

[16-20]
The middle way opens. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofThe text dissolves the one who would understand it.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The path doesn't lead to the fruit; the path IS the fruit seen from a distance.

[21-25]
The feminine principle. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeWhat searches for recognition is already it.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like hailstones drumming on tin roof, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
A practitioner once. watched sunlight filtering through high cloud cover. Nothing special. Just cover being cover. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is called 'ground' is not a starting point but the ever-present basis.

[36-40]
All dissolves into. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeThe awareness that feels confused has never been confused.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
No need for complexity. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe wisdom described is not acquired but acknowledged.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
In practice. Wind-carved clouds above plateauWhat is spoken is the unspeakable nature of awareness.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Ground, path, and fruit are not sequential—they are three ways of describing one recognition.

[51-55]
Thus established. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millYour immediate awareness is the treasury Longchenpa reveals.

[56-60]
Spontaneously arising. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forest. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as rhododendron blooming in cloud forest.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom.

Harmonious view. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedLongchenpa's words point beyond themselves to direct experience.

The path doesn't lead to the fruit; the path IS the fruit seen from a distance.

[66-70]
In simple terms. Stream finding path through moraineThe nature Longchenpa describes arises as naturally as fog lifting from valley floor.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[71-75]
Simply this. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksThe teaching offers recognition, not information.

The heart sees. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowLike ice cracking on frozen lake, recognition cannot be forced, only allowed.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

Plainly speaking. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe treasury reveals what is as self-existing as sound fading into silence.

The tradition holds. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverSamsara and nirvana are not different in this nature.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free.

[96-100]
In other words. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricDzogchen points to the nature (rang bzhin) of mind, which requires no modification.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[101-105]
Dancing recognition. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineWhat appears in these words is as primordial as spring water bubbling from earth.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[106-110]
Intensity without aggression. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like glacier melting into high-altitude lake—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom.

The term implies. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.
