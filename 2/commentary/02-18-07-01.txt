See what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like ice crystals forming on tent fabric—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

Thogal is the sun rising—no one pushes it over the horizon. It is the natural display of awareness recognizing itself, not through effort but through the exhaustion of effort. The visions are not attainments; they are the luminescence of recognition, like heat rising from fire—natural, spontaneous, undeniable.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of recognition.

[6-10]
Therefore. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe treasury holds what you already possess but do not recognize.

The four lamps are four ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere. The flesh lamp is the body seen as display. The far-reaching water lamp is perception recognized as projection. The lamp of empty bindus is form recognized as light. The lamp of self-originated wisdom is mind recognizing mind.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The visionary sees. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lake. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as distant glacier calving into turquoise lake.

The vajra chain (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) is not a sequence to follow but the linking of moments, each complete, each connected to what never left it. The chain is golden from beginning to end—if you see one link as base metal, you miss the gold of all.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Precise analysis reveals. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe mind that questions is the mind that answers.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The four lamps are not visual phenomena but ways rigpa sees itself.

[21-25]
Intimate recognition. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThe teaching points to what is already present, not what must be attained.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like stream finding path through moraine, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This mountain dweller. watched wildflowers blooming above tree line. Nothing special. Just line being line. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The vajra chain is the chain of moments, each complete, each linked.

[36-40]
The unity appears. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverLike bird migrating without map, awareness requires no support to exist.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-46]
What is needed? Nothing. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofWhat is spoken is the unspeakable nature of awareness.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[47-51]
Beyond form and formless. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[52-56]
What is needed? Nothing. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamWhat appears to not understand is the understanding appearing.

Plainly speaking. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe meaning here is as ungraspable yet present as heat rising from sun-warmed stone.

Heart of the matter. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeYour ordinary mind right now is Buddha-mind.

Mighty understanding. Constellation rotating around north starThe nature of this moment is the nature (rang bzhin) of all moments.

In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[77-81]
Nothing more. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe teaching reveals what is as natural as aurora dancing without dancer.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Enough. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe space in which these words arise is the nature (rang bzhin) described.

[93-97]
Sudden recognition! Like dust devils swirling across dry lakebed—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

The heart sees. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverThe Dzogchen view dissolves the one who views it.
