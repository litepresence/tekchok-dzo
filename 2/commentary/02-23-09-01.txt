Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like thunder echoing through empty valley—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The first bardo of clear light is not after death—it is the clear light of this awareness, seen when fixation drops. The second bardo of dharmata is not a vision but the display of mind's nature, always present, usually obscured. The third bardo of becoming is not rebirth but the continuation of not-recognizing, moment by moment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[6-10]
Thus established. Constellation rotating around north starThe mind that questions is the mind that answers.

Recognition in the bardo is not different from recognition now. The only difference is urgency: now we can afford to pretend we have time; in the bardo, the pretense drops away. But the recognition is the same—the seeing that awareness has never been born and never dies.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The play of appearance. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

The instructions for the bardo are instructions for this moment. 'Do not fear the deities' means do not fear your own nature. 'Recognize the clear light' means recognize this awareness, unobscured by fixation. 'Rest without distraction' means rest now, not later.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents.

[16-20]
The middle way opens. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe meaning here is found in the space between the words.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[21-25]
Beyond words. Stream finding path through moraineLike fog lifting from valley floor, it requires no effort to be what it is.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like marmot whistling across alpine meadow, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This hermit. watched juniper smoke rising from monastery roof. Nothing special. Just roof being roof. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[36-40]
All dissolves into. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricWhat seeks recognition is already recognized in the seeking.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
What is needed? Nothing. Yak bells clanking at duskThe Dzogchen view is not a view to adopt but the nature (rang bzhin) to recognize.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[46-50]
The great view. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windWhat hears or reads this is what is being pointed to.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[51-55]
Sudden recognition! Like rhododendron blooming in cloud forest—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[56-60]
In other words. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThis passage invites the recognition of primordial completeness.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[61-65]
Analysis proceeds. Stone cairn marking mountain passThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[66-70]
Scriptural reference. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe text invites seeing what has always been the case.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[71-75]
Analysis proceeds. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderWhat is sought has never been apart from the seeker.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[76-80]
Consequently. Constellation rotating around north starThe teaching describes what is as free as seed sprouting without instruction.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

Indestructible recognition. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe teaching reveals what is as natural as perfume rising from unseen flowers.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[111-115]
Does it have a root? Look. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like glacier melting into high-altitude lake—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[136-140]
The feminine principle. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThis verse reveals what is as vast as sound fading into silence.

Sudden recognition! Like rainbow arching over nomad tents—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[267-271]
Precise analysis reveals. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeWhat is taught is the unteachable nature of awareness.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[272-276]
With precision. Yak bells clanking at duskWhat Longchenpa reveals is the ground (gzhi) of all appearance, always available.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[277-281]
Practice reveals. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe treasury holds what you already possess but do not recognize.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[282-286]
Essence nature. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe treasury reveals that there is nothing to reveal.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[287-291]
The phrase reveals. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverDzogchen is the end of all paths, including the path to Dzogchen.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[292-296]
Practice reveals. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windThere is no meditation to do, only recognition to allow.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[297-301]
The distinction illuminates. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedWhat is sought has never been apart from the seeker.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[302-306]
Snying po. Hailstones drumming on tin roofLongchenpa's words point beyond themselves to direct experience.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[307-311]
The path shows. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe meaning here is as ungraspable yet present as mushroom emerging overnight.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[312-316]
No need for complexity. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[317-321]
In practice. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamLike ice cracking on frozen lake, it requires no effort to be what it is.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[322-326]
Effortless recognition. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsWhat Longchenpa reveals is the ground (gzhi) of all appearance, always available.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[327-331]
Dancing recognition. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe treasury reveals that there is nothing to reveal.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[332-336]
Plainly speaking. Eagle circling on thermal updraftLike bird migrating without map, recognition cannot be forced, only allowed.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[337-341]
The diamond point. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe teaching describes what is as free as moon pulling tides without effort.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[342-346]
Exact recognition. Constellation rotating around north starThe knowing quality of this instant is Dharmakaya itself.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[347-351]
To put it clearly. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofThe Dzogchen view is as unmanufactured as ice cracking on frozen lake.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[352-356]
Rest, simply rest. Stream finding path through moraineThe texture of experience now is the Dzogchen view.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[357-361]
Spontaneous display. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windThe knowing quality of this instant is Dharmakaya itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[362-366]
Simply stated. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeThis passage describes what is as undefiled as aurora dancing without dancer.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[367-371]
The specific point. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe concepts about emptiness are emptiness itself.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[372-376]
Arising naturally. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverThis passage speaks of what is as empty yet apparent as mountain shadows shifting with the sun.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[377-381]
Beyond form and formless. Marmot whistling across alpine meadow. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as marmot whistling across alpine meadow.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[382-386]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like distant glacier calving into turquoise lake—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[387-391]
Nothing more. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThe distinction between deluded and liberated mind dissolves here.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains.

Practice reveals. Yak bells clanking at duskWhat hears or reads this is what is being pointed to.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[397-401]
The phrase reveals. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThe nature described here is as effortless as perfume rising from unseen flowers.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[402-406]
Translation:. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe confusion about the meaning is itself luminous clarity.

The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable.

Opening naturally. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe teaching points to what is already present, not what must be attained.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom.

Emaho! Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe mind that questions is the mind that answers.

Intimate recognition. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe aggregates that bind are the display that liberates.

When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[422-426]
The essential point. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeWhat is taught here is as unconstructed as crystal forming in silent cave.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[427-431]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like stone cairn marking mountain pass, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

[432-436]
This wanderer. watched eagle circling on thermal updraft. Nothing special. Just updraft being updraft. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends.
