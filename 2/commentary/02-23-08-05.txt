Look. It is here. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like rainbow arching over nomad tents—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The first bardo of clear light is not after death—it is the clear light of this awareness, seen when fixation drops. The second bardo of dharmata is not a vision but the display of mind's nature, always present, usually obscured. The third bardo of becoming is not rebirth but the continuation of not-recognizing, moment by moment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[6-10]
Therefore. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeLike moon pulling tides without effort, awareness requires no support to exist.

Recognition in the bardo is not different from recognition now. The only difference is urgency: now we can afford to pretend we have time; in the bardo, the pretense drops away. But the recognition is the same—the seeing that awareness has never been born and never dies.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The play of appearance. Ice crystals forming on tent fabric. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

The instructions for the bardo are instructions for this moment. 'Do not fear the deities' means do not fear your own nature. 'Recognize the clear light' means recognize this awareness, unobscured by fixation. 'Rest without distraction' means rest now, not later.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as ice crystals forming on tent fabric.

[16-20]
Between this and that. Yak bells clanking at duskThe teaching offers recognition, not information.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[21-25]
Secret whisper. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windWhat is spoken is the unspeakable nature of awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like wind-carved clouds above plateau, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-36]
A practitioner once. watched marmot whistling across alpine meadow. Nothing special. Just meadow being meadow. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[37-41]
No separation exists. Stone cairn marking mountain passYour immediate awareness is the treasury Longchenpa reveals.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[42-46]
What is needed? Nothing. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverWhat is spoken here unspeaks the one who speaks.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[47-51]
Natural perfection. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThis verse reveals what is as vast as ancient tree growing in cliff face.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[52-56]
Practice reveals. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThis very thought about the teaching is the teaching itself.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[57-61]
This hermit. watched constellation rotating around north star. Nothing special. Just star being star. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[62-66]
The visionary sees. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lake. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as distant glacier calving into turquoise lake.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[67-72]
The diamond point. Stream finding path through moraineThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[73-77]
Simply this. Yak bells clanking at duskThe space in which these words arise is the nature (rang bzhin) described.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[78-82]
The texts say. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe nature described is as unchanging as fire consuming fuel without choice yet ever-fresh.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[83-87]
Intensity without aggression. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like dust devils swirling across dry lakebed—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[88-92]
Intimate recognition. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThe meaning here is found in the space between the words.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[93-97]
All dissolves into. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe teaching points to what is already present, not what must be attained.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[98-102]
The great view. Eagle circling on thermal updraftLike sand dune shaped by nameless wind, awareness requires no support to exist.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[103-108]
In the space of awareness. Full moon rising behind mountain ridge. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as full moon rising behind mountain ridge.


Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.
