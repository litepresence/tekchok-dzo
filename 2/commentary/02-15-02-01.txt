[1-5]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like wind-carved clouds above plateau—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The life-wind (srog rlung) is not breath in the body—it is the vibration of awareness forgetting itself, the pulse of rigpa pretending to be separate. When recognition dawns, the breath continues but the pretense drops. The body breathes; awareness does not. This is the secret of longevity practices—they work with the pretend, not the real.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The winds (rlung) are not air moving through channels—they are the movement of mind itself.

[6-10]
Consequently. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThe Dzogchen view is not a view to adopt but the nature (rang bzhin) to recognize.

The five winds are five ways rigpa obscures itself: upward-moving wind grasps at heaven, downward-clearing wind grasps at earth, fire-accompanying wind grasps at metabolism, pervading wind grasps at extension, life-sustaining wind grasps at continuity. Grasping at any is samsara; recognizing all as display is nirvana.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[11-15]
In the space of awareness. Eagle circling on thermal updraft. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as eagle circling on thermal updraft.

Channels (rtsa) are not tubes in a body—they are pathways of habit, grooves of recognition and non-recognition. The central channel is not a physical structure but the center that was never off-center. The left and right channels are not anatomical—they are the duality that seems to split what was never two.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
The middle way opens. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe confusion about the meaning is itself luminous clarity.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called 'life-wind' (srog rlung) is simply awareness not recognizing itself.

[21-25]
Secret whisper. Yak bells clanking at duskWhat is called confusion is wisdom not recognizing itself.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This mountain dweller. watched distant glacier calving into turquoise lake. Nothing special. Just lake being lake. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The five winds are five ways awareness pretends to be limited.

[36-40]
All dissolves into. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millYour immediate awareness is the treasury Longchenpa reveals.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[41-45]
No need for complexity. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[46-50]
With precision. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe Dzogchen view is not a view to adopt but the nature (rang bzhin) to recognize.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The winds (rlung) are not air moving through channels—they are the movement of mind itself.

[51-55]
This old fool. watched constellation rotating around north star. Nothing special. Just star being star. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[56-60]
In the space of awareness. Stream finding path through moraine. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as stream finding path through moraine.

But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[61-65]
Intensity without aggression. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like full moon rising behind mountain ridge—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[66-70]
Wisdom words. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe meaning here is as ungraspable yet present as moon pulling tides without effort.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Therefore. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe space in which these words arise is the nature (rang bzhin) described.
