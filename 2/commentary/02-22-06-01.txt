Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of awareness recognizing itself. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

Khregs chod cuts the cutter—the one who cuts through is the final veil. When the analyzer is analyzed, what remains? Pure awareness without analyzer or analyzed, without cutter or cut. The cutting is the recognition that there is nothing to cut.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Khregs chod cuts the cutter—the one who cuts through is also cut through.

[6-10]
Trechö cuts the cutter—there is no one who cuts through, only cutting. As natural as breathing.

Lhun grub (spontaneous presence) is not something that happens but the happening itself, uncaused and unconditioned. Like fire burning without deciding to burn, like water flowing without choosing to flow—awareness knows without a knower, displays without a displayer.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
Spontaneously arising. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream.

The unity of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is not a unity achieved but a unity recognized as never divided. Like wetness and water, like heat and fire—they have never been two, only described as two for those who need to hear about water before they can drink.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Spontaneous presence is not something that happens but the happening itself. This is the treasury's heart.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. As effortless as water being wet.

Thod rgal is not over there but the natural display of what's right here.

[21-25]
Clear light is not a light to see but the seeing that illuminates itself. Like waking from sleep.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of awareness recognizing itself. The nature is complete.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Like finding you were never lost.

Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is not something that happens—it is the happening.

[36-40]
Trechö cuts the cutter—there is no one who cuts through, only cutting. Recognition is immediate.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. effortless, like water being wet.

[41-45]
Primordial purity is not before impurity but the nature (rang bzhin) that is never stained. As when realizing you were never asleep.cognition! Like dust devils swirling across dry lakebed—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

[51-55]
Clear light is not a light to see but the seeing that illuminates itself. Like finding you were never lost.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Khregs chod cuts the cutter—the one who cuts through is also cut through.

[56-61]
Direct seeing sees without a seer—the seen and seeing are one. effortless, like water being wet.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[62-66]
