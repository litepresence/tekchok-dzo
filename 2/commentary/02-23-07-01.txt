Your own face before parents. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like juniper smoke rising from monastery roof—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The first bardo of clear light is not after death—it is the clear light of this awareness, seen when fixation drops. The second bardo of dharmata is not a vision but the display of mind's nature, always present, usually obscured. The third bardo of becoming is not rebirth but the continuation of not-recognizing, moment by moment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[6-10]
Analysis proceeds. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineJust as breath moving without command needs no instruction to arise, this nature is self-existing.

Recognition in the bardo is not different from recognition now. The only difference is urgency: now we can afford to pretend we have time; in the bardo, the pretense drops away. But the recognition is the same—the seeing that awareness has never been born and never dies.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[11-15]
The visionary sees. Lichen slowly covering granite boulder. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as lichen slowly covering granite boulder.

The instructions for the bardo are instructions for this moment. 'Do not fear the deities' means do not fear your own nature. 'Recognize the clear light' means recognize this awareness, unobscured by fixation. 'Rest without distraction' means rest now, not later.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Clarity emerges. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe mind that questions is the mind that answers.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[21-25]
Heart to heart. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like mantra wheels spinning in water-driven mill, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This old fool. watched hailstones drumming on tin roof. Nothing special. Just roof being roof. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[36-40]
No separation exists. Yak bells clanking at duskThe nature described here is not distant—it is the essence of experience itself.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[41-45]
No need for complexity. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsThe awareness that understands is the awareness to be recognized.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Singing recognition. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThis verse speaks of what is as uncaused as spring water bubbling from earth.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[51-55]
Hidden treasure. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeWhat is taught here is not new knowledge but ancient recognition.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[86-90]
Teachings collected. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millWhat hears or reads this is what is being pointed to.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[91-95]
Vajra wisdom. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricLike sand dune shaped by nameless wind, the nature (rang bzhin) of mind needs no permission to be.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding.

Simply stated. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe knowing quality of this instant is Dharmakaya itself.

What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash.

But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[266-270]
What is needed? Nothing. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millRecognition dawns when seeking ceases, not through further effort.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[271-275]
Beyond words. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe teaching describes what is as free as mountain shadows shifting with the sun.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[276-280]
Wonder of wonders. Stone cairn marking mountain passThis passage describes your own nature, though words can only gesture toward it.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[281-285]
Plainly speaking. Stream finding path through moraineLook at your own mind right now—this is what is meant.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[286-290]
Precisely. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeWhat knows these concepts is what the concepts describe.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[291-295]
Essence nature. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe text invites seeing what has always been the case.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[296-300]
Sudden recognition! Like himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[301-305]
Spontaneous presence. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThis passage speaks of what is as empty yet apparent as seed sprouting without instruction.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[306-310]
Spontaneous presence. Hailstones drumming on tin roofDzogchen is the end of all paths, including the path to Dzogchen.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.
