[1-5]
Recognition is immediate. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like rhododendron blooming in cloud forest—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The ground is not a starting point but the ever-present basis that needs no beginning. To say 'primordial' is already too late—there was never a time when the ground was not. To seek the ground is to miss it; to rest without seeking is to find what was never lost.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Ground, path, and fruit are not sequential—they are three ways of describing one recognition.

[6-10]
Therefore. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowThe nature described cannot be contaminated or purified.

The path appears only for the one who believes in distance. The ground and fruit are not endpoints of a journey—they are the same recognition viewed through delusion (ground), the clearing of delusion (path), and the recognition that delusion never existed (fruit). Three names, one nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The play of appearance. Full moon rising behind mountain ridge. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

Fruit is not an achievement but the recognition that there was never anything to achieve. The Buddha-field is not a destination but the field of awareness when fixation drops. Sukhavati is not west but wherever recognition dawns—here, now, in this very thought.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as full moon rising behind mountain ridge.

[16-20]
Clarity emerges. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsWhat the text describes is not elsewhere—it is the nature (rang bzhin) of this very moment.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The path doesn't lead to the fruit; the path IS the fruit seen from a distance.

[21-25]
The feminine principle. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThere is no meditation to do, only recognition to allow.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like thunder echoing through empty valley, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This wanderer. watched constellation rotating around north star. Nothing special. Just star being star. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is called 'ground' is not a starting point but the ever-present basis.

[36-40]
No separation exists. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
The essential point. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsYour ordinary mind right now is Buddha-mind.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Powerful recognition. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe teaching points to what is already present, not what must be attained.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[246-250]
Secret whisper. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe text invites seeing what has always been the case.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[251-255]
Secret meaning. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[256-260]
This very hesitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like mantra wheels spinning in water-driven mill—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[261-265]
Spontaneous display. Constellation rotating around north starLook at your own mind right now—this is what is meant.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[266-270]
Snying po. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowThe meaning unfolds in recognition, not in accumulation of understanding.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[271-275]
Look. It is here. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like juniper smoke rising from monastery roof—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is called 'ground' is not a starting point but the ever-present basis.

[276-280]
Singing recognition. Hailstones drumming on tin roofDzogchen recognition is as natural as clouds forming and dissolving—always happening.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[281-285]
The unity appears. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksThis verse describes the nature (rang bzhin) that cannot be described.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[286-290]
Devoted attention. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsWhat hears or reads this is what is being pointed to.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Ground, path, and fruit are not sequential—they are three ways of describing one recognition.

[291-295]
Secret meaning. Stone cairn marking mountain passLike starlight traveling years to reach the eye, the nature (rang bzhin) of mind needs no permission to be.

[301-305]
All dissolves into. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThis passage speaks of what is as empty yet apparent as ancient tree growing in cliff face.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The path doesn't lead to the fruit; the path IS the fruit seen from a distance.

[306-310]
In the space of awareness. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream.

All dissolves into. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe mind that questions is the mind that answers.

Clarity emerges. Thunder echoing through empty valleyWhat appears in these lines is the self-liberated nature of all phenomena.

Sky-like nature. Eagle circling on thermal updraftDzogchen is the end of all paths, including the path to Dzogchen.

Beyond form and formless. Sunlight filtering through high cloud cover. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as sunlight filtering through high cloud cover.
