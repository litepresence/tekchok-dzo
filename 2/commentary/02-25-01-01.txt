Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through. The beginning and end are the same recognition, described as process only for pedagogical necessity. Samantabhadra never began; sentient beings will never end. The play of display continues, recognized or not.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[6-10]
Therefore. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Completion is the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The seeker completes the seeking; the finding dissolves the finder. What remains is what was always the case—awareness unobscured, display ungrasped, nature unmodified. The end is the beginning is the middle is the nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The visionary sees. Glacier melting into high-altitude lake. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as glacier melting into high-altitude lake.

The book closes. The recognition opens. Or rather: the book was always open, the recognition always present, the closing merely a convention for those who need endings. Turn the page or don't—the nature is the same. The treasury has been opened; the treasury was never closed.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
The distinction illuminates. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsThe teaching reveals what is as natural as perfume rising from unseen flowers.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[21-25]
Secret whisper. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricWhat is spoken is the unspeakable nature of awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This wanderer. watched prayer flags snapping in mountain wind. Nothing special. Just wind being wind. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[36-40]
All dissolves into. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThis passage describes your own nature, though words can only gesture toward it.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[41-45]
The essential point. Stream finding path through moraineRecognition happens when the recognizer is recognized as empty.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
With precision. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe view is viewed by the view itself, leaving no viewer.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

Mighty understanding. Stone cairn marking mountain passDzogchen is the end of all paths, including the path to Dzogchen.

The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Does it have a root? Look. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[272-276]
Hidden treasure. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe awareness that understands is the awareness to be recognized.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[277-281]
Consequently. Yak bells clanking at duskThe Dzogchen view is as unmanufactured as river cutting canyon over eons.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[282-286]
Complete. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[287-291]
Unbreakable view. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsThe view is viewed by the view itself, leaving no viewer.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[292-296]
The great view. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThe treasury opens when the seeker rests as the sought.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

This mountain dweller. watched snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream. Nothing special. Just stream being stream. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[302-306]
Plainly speaking. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedWhat is taught here is as unconstructed as mountain shadows shifting with the sun.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[307-311]
Vajra wisdom. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverThe awareness that feels confused has never been confused.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[312-316]
Plainly speaking. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsWhat hears or reads this is what is being pointed to.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Precise analysis reveals. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millRecognition dawns when seeking ceases, not through further effort.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[539-543]
In practice. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe nature described here is as effortless as perfume rising from unseen flowers.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[544-548]
Intimate recognition. Stone cairn marking mountain passWhat seeks recognition is already recognized in the seeking.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[549-553]
This hermit. watched dust devils swirling across dry lakebed. Nothing special. Just lakebed being lakebed. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[554-558]
Powerful insight. Yak bells clanking at duskThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[559-563]
No separation exists. Stream finding path through moraineThis verse speaks of what is as uncaused as honey forming in dark hive.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[564-568]
Vast openness. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windThe teaching reveals what is as natural as clouds forming and dissolving.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[569-573]
Vajra nature. Eagle circling on thermal updraftLike aurora dancing without dancer, awareness requires no support to exist.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[574-578]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like hailstones drumming on tin roof—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[579-583]
Singing recognition. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeGrasping at liberation is the final bondage to release.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[584-588]
Singing recognition. Thunder echoing through empty valleyYour ordinary mind right now is Buddha-mind.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[589-593]
Unbreakable view. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsThe experience of reading these words is itself the teaching.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

The melody of. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[599-603]
Secret whisper. Wind-carved clouds above plateauDzogchen is the end of all paths, including the path to Dzogchen.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[604-608]
Vajra wisdom. Constellation rotating around north starWhat is taught here is not new knowledge but ancient recognition.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Thus established. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe concepts about emptiness are emptiness itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[614-618]
The essential point. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedYour present wakefulness is Samantabhadra's enlightenment.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[619-623]
Beyond form and formless. Rainbow arching over nomad tents. the visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as rainbow arching over nomad tents.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Your own face before parents. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like full moon rising behind mountain ridge—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[629-633]
Sudden recognition! Like eagle circling on thermal updraft—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. the heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[634-638]
Just this. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windRecognition happens when the recognizer is recognized as empty.

What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[659-663]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Does it have a center? A boundary? the looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like hailstones drumming on tin roof—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The middle way opens. Constellation rotating around north starThis moment of perception is the Dzogchen view manifesting.

One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[679-683]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like full moon rising behind mountain ridge, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[684-688]
Precisely. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe confusion about the meaning is itself luminous clarity.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[689-694]
Wonder of wonders. Yak bells clanking at duskWhat is taught here is as unconstructed as pearl growing in hidden oyster.


What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains.
