[1-5]
See what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like distant glacier calving into turquoise lake—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through. The beginning and end are the same recognition, described as process only for pedagogical necessity. Samantabhadra never began; sentient beings will never end. The play of display continues, recognized or not.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[6-10]
The framework reveals. Stone cairn marking mountain passLike mountain shadows shifting with the sun, it requires no effort to be what it is.

Completion is the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The seeker completes the seeking; the finding dissolves the finder. What remains is what was always the case—awareness unobscured, display ungrasped, nature unmodified. The end is the beginning is the middle is the nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[11-15]
The visionary sees. Marmot whistling across alpine meadow. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as marmot whistling across alpine meadow.

The book closes. The recognition opens. Or rather: the book was always open, the recognition always present, the closing merely a convention for those who need endings. Turn the page or don't—the nature is the same. The treasury has been opened; the treasury was never closed.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Clarity emerges. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverWhat you are now is what all verses describe.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[21-25]
Secret whisper. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThe space in which these words arise is the nature (rang bzhin) described.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like ice crystals forming on tent fabric, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
A practitioner once. watched full moon rising behind mountain ridge. Nothing special. Just ridge being ridge. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[36-40]
The unity appears. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windThe text is a finger pointing—look not at the finger.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
The essential point. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksWhat is called confusion is wisdom not recognizing itself.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Sudden recognition! Like lichen slowly covering granite boulder—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[51-55]
Words translate. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe treasury reveals that there is nothing to reveal.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable.

[56-60]
Therefore. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millWhat is spoken here unspeaks the one who speaks.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[61-65]
The middle way opens. Thunder echoing through empty valleySamsara and nirvana are not different in this nature.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[66-70]
Exact recognition. Stone cairn marking mountain passThe teaching describes what is as free as starlight traveling years to reach the eye.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[71-75]
Teachings collected. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowWhat appears in these lines is the self-liberated nature of all phenomena.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[76-80]
The distinction illuminates. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe nature described is as unchanging as comet streaking through void yet ever-fresh.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Concealed wisdom. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsRecognition happens when the recognizer is recognized as empty.

Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[86-90]
Simply this. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe texture of experience now is the Dzogchen view.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[91-95]
Exactly so. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe teaching points to what is already present, not what must be attained.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[96-101]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like rainbow arching over nomad tents—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Sky-like nature. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThe perceiver and perceived are both the treasury's display.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[107-111]
Vast openness. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamTrying to understand prevents the understanding that is always present.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

Spontaneously arising. Full moon rising behind mountain ridge. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as full moon rising behind mountain ridge.

[117-121]
The feminine principle. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels.

The essential point. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThe view is viewed by the view itself, leaving no viewer.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
