Look. It is here. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like eagle circling on thermal updraft—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through. The beginning and end are the same recognition, described as process only for pedagogical necessity. Samantabhadra never began; sentient beings will never end. The play of display continues, recognized or not.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

Analysis proceeds. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe text dissolves the one who would understand it.

Completion is the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The seeker completes the seeking; the finding dissolves the finder. What remains is what was always the case—awareness unobscured, display ungrasped, nature unmodified. The end is the beginning is the middle is the nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The visionary sees. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forest. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as rhododendron blooming in cloud forest.

The book closes. The recognition opens. Or rather: the book was always open, the recognition always present, the closing merely a convention for those who need endings. Turn the page or don't—the nature is the same. The treasury has been opened; the treasury was never closed.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Clarity emerges. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamDzogchen recognition is as natural as honey forming in dark hive—always happening.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

Secret whisper. Thunder echoing through empty valleyWhat Longchenpa transmits is as immediate as comet streaking through void.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[23-27]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like wildflowers blooming above tree line, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

This completes the commentary. The treasury has been opened, the meaning revealed—not through analysis but through recognition. Rest in that.
Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.
