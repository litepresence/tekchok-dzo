Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of awareness recognizing itself. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

Khregs chod cuts the cutter—the one who cuts through is the final veil. When the analyzer is analyzed, what remains? Pure awareness without analyzer or analyzed, without cutter or cut. The cutting is the recognition that there is nothing to cut.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Khregs chod cuts the cutter—the one who cuts through is also cut through.

[2-2]
Trechö cuts the cutter—there is no one who cuts through, only cutting. As natural as breathing.

Lhun grub (spontaneous presence) is not something that happens but the happening itself, uncaused and unconditioned. Like fire burning without deciding to burn, like water flowing without choosing to flow—awareness knows without a knower, displays without a displayer.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[3-4]
Spontaneously arising. Wildflowers blooming above tree line. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as wildflowers blooming above tree line.

The unity of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is not a unity achieved but a unity recognized as never divided. Like wetness and water, like heat and fire—they have never been two, only described as two for those who need to hear about water before they can drink.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[5-5]
Spontaneous presence is not something that happens but the happening itself. Rest in this understanding.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. As effortless as water being wet.

Thod rgal is not over there but the natural display of what's right here.

[6-6]
Clear light is not a light to see but the seeing that illuminates itself. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[7-8]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like yak bells clanking at dusk, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.
