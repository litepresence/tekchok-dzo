Look. It is here. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like ice crystals forming on tent fabric—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

Thogal is the sun rising—no one pushes it over the horizon. It is the natural display of awareness recognizing itself, not through effort but through the exhaustion of effort. The visions are not attainments; they are the luminescence of recognition, like heat rising from fire—natural, spontaneous, undeniable.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of recognition.

[6-10]
Therefore. Stone cairn marking mountain passThis verse describes the nature (rang bzhin) that cannot be described.

The four lamps are four ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere. The flesh lamp is the body seen as display. The far-reaching water lamp is perception recognized as projection. The lamp of empty bindus is form recognized as light. The lamp of self-originated wisdom is mind recognizing mind.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
Spontaneously arising. Full moon rising behind mountain ridge. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as full moon rising behind mountain ridge.

The vajra chain (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) is not a sequence to follow but the linking of moments, each complete, each connected to what never left it. The chain is golden from beginning to end—if you see one link as base metal, you miss the gold of all.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Precise analysis reveals. Constellation rotating around north starThis passage speaks of what is as empty yet apparent as bird migrating without map.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The four lamps are not visual phenomena but ways rigpa sees itself.

[21-25]
Secret whisper. Eagle circling on thermal updraftWhat knows these concepts is what the concepts describe.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like yak bells clanking at dusk, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This hermit. watched wind-carved clouds above plateau.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Nothing special. Just plateau being plateau.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

The vajra chain is the chain of moments, each complete, each linked.

[36-40]
Natural perfection. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe treasury reveals what is as self-existing as seed sprouting without instruction.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
Rest, simply rest. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThe treasury holds what is as intimate as bird migrating without map.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like glacier melting into high-altitude lake, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[51-55]
The code unlocks. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe treasury opens when the seeker rests as the sought.

Precisely. Stream finding path through moraineWhat is pointed to is as ordinary yet extraordinary as heart beating without decision.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The tune of. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThe meaning unfolds in recognition, not in accumulation of understanding.

Thogal is not leaping over but the natural leap of recognition.

[66-70]
This very hesitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like full moon rising behind mountain ridge—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death.

To put it clearly. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeTrying to understand prevents the understanding that is always present.

No separation exists. Constellation rotating around north starThe treasury contains what has always been your own.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.
