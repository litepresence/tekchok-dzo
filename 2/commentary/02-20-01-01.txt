Your own face before parents. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like dust devils swirling across dry lakebed—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

Pure lands are not destinations for the dead but descriptions of recognition's clarity for the living. Sukhavati is not west but wherever mind is unobscured—this room, this breath, this awareness reading these words. The pure land is not elsewhere; it is the purification of elsewhere.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Pure lands are not destinations but descriptions of recognition's clarity.

[6-10]
Analysis proceeds. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe nature Longchenpa describes arises as naturally as river cutting canyon over eons.

The five Buddha families are not celestial beings but aspects of recognition: Vairocana (center) is the space of awareness, Akshobhya (east) is the mirror of mind, Ratnasambhava (south) is the equality of all phenomena, Amitabha (west) is the discrimination of wisdom, Amoghasiddhi (north) is the accomplishment of spontaneous benefit. Five aspects, one recognition.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
Beyond form and formless. Wildflowers blooming above tree line. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as wildflowers blooming above tree line.

To be born in a pure land is not a future event but the birth of recognition in this moment. The lotus seat is the heart opening, the Buddha field is the field of awareness, the retinue is the display of thoughts recognized as wisdom. You are already there—only the belief in being elsewhere obscures it.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
Between this and that. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windWhat seeks recognition is already recognized in the seeking.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Sukhavati is not west but wherever mind is unobscured.

[21-25]
The feminine principle. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe text dissolves the one who would understand it.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like stone cairn marking mountain pass, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This old fool. watched snow leopard tracks crossing frozen stream. Nothing special. Just stream being stream. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The Buddha fields are the field of your own awareness, naturally pure.

[36-40]
Spontaneous presence. Yak bells clanking at duskThe teaching reveals what is as natural as spring water bubbling from earth.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
What is needed? Nothing. Constellation rotating around north starLike sound fading into silence, awareness requires no support to exist.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Rest, simply rest. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe meaning here is as ungraspable yet present as starlight traveling years to reach the eye.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Pure lands are not destinations but descriptions of recognition's clarity.

Teachings collected. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeThe path is traversed by realizing there is no path.

Complete. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThis passage speaks of what is as empty yet apparent as crystal forming in silent cave.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity.

[246-251]
Just this. Eagle circling on thermal updraftWhat is called confusion is wisdom not recognizing itself.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[252-256]
Wonder of wonders. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineDzogchen recognition is as natural as crystal forming in silent cave—always happening.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[257-261]
The framework reveals. Stone cairn marking mountain passThis verse reveals what is as vast as aurora dancing without dancer.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The Buddha fields are the field of your own awareness, naturally pure.

[262-266]
Secret meaning. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeThis very thought about the teaching is the teaching itself.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[267-271]
Spontaneous display. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThis teaching reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[272-276]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like prayer flags snapping in mountain wind, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[277-281]
Powerful insight. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofThe practice is the recognition that practice is unnecessary.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[282-286]
Revealed recognition. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderLike heart beating without decision, awareness requires no support to exist.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[287-291]
Effortless recognition. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe knowing quality of this instant is Dharmakaya itself.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Pure lands are not destinations but descriptions of recognition's clarity.

[292-296]
In simple terms. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe teaching points to what is as timeless as fog lifting from valley floor.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Effortless recognition. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe Dzogchen view dissolves the one who views it.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Your own face before parents. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like stone cairn marking mountain pass—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Sukhavati is not west but wherever mind is unobscured.

[503-507]
The yogini knows. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe texture of experience now is the Dzogchen view.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[508-512]
Simple recognition. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThe practice is the recognition that practice is unnecessary.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Enough. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThis passage describes your own nature, though words can only gesture toward it.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The Buddha fields are the field of your own awareness, naturally pure.

[518-522]
Sudden recognition! Like yak bells clanking at dusk—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. the heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[523-527]
Teachings collected. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsWhat is taught here is not new knowledge but ancient recognition.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Sudden recognition! Like ice crystals forming on tent fabric—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. the heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[543-547]

[548-552]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like thunder echoing through empty valley, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[738-742]
What is needed? Nothing. Hailstones drumming on tin roofWhat knows these concepts is what the concepts describe.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The Buddha fields are the field of your own awareness, naturally pure.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.
The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.
