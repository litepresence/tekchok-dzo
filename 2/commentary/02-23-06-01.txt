Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like distant glacier calving into turquoise lake—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The first bardo of clear light is not after death—it is the clear light of this awareness, seen when fixation drops. The second bardo of dharmata is not a vision but the display of mind's nature, always present, usually obscured. The third bardo of becoming is not rebirth but the continuation of not-recognizing, moment by moment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[6-10]
Analysis proceeds. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedTrying to understand prevents the understanding that is always present.

Recognition in the bardo is not different from recognition now. The only difference is urgency: now we can afford to pretend we have time; in the bardo, the pretense drops away. But the recognition is the same—the seeing that awareness has never been born and never dies.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
In the space of awareness. Eagle circling on thermal updraft. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as eagle circling on thermal updraft.

The instructions for the bardo are instructions for this moment. 'Do not fear the deities' means do not fear your own nature. 'Recognize the clear light' means recognize this awareness, unobscured by fixation. 'Rest without distraction' means rest now, not later.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
The middle way opens. Yak bells clanking at duskThe mind that questions is the mind that answers.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[21-25]
Intimate recognition. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThis instant of experience is the only scripture needed.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like prayer flags snapping in mountain wind, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This hermit. watched juniper smoke rising from monastery roof. Nothing special. Just roof being roof. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[36-40]
Spontaneous presence. Marmot whistling across alpine meadowWhat is spoken is the unspeakable nature of awareness.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[41-45]
Simple recognition. Stream finding path through moraineLongchenpa's words point beyond themselves to direct experience.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[46-50]
Spontaneous joy. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe present experience cannot be separated from primordial wisdom.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[51-55]
See what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like himalayan griffon soaring on wind currents—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[56-60]
The yogini knows. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThis verse describes the nature (rang bzhin) that cannot be described.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom.

When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Sudden recognition! Like yak bells clanking at dusk—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Precisely. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksYour ordinary mind right now is Buddha-mind.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[268-272]
The yogini knows. Hailstones drumming on tin roofWhat you are now is what all verses describe.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[273-277]
Heart to heart. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedThis verse describes the nature (rang bzhin) that cannot be described.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured.

[278-282]
See what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like ice crystals forming on tent fabric—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[283-287]
Mighty understanding. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windLike fog lifting from valley floor, it requires no effort to be what it is.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[288-292]
Secret meaning. Constellation rotating around north starThe seeker and sought are one in the treasury's view.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The bardo instructions are not for later but for this very moment of reading.

[293-297]
Vajra nature. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeWhat seeks recognition is already recognized in the seeking.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[298-302]
Precisely. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderYour ordinary mind right now is Buddha-mind.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[303-307]
In practice. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofThe confusion about the meaning is itself luminous clarity.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition now is liberation then; there is no later, only now postponed.

[308-312]
Dancing recognition. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThere is no meditation to do, only recognition to allow.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[313-317]
Intensity without aggression. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Without effort. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe treasury reveals what is as self-existing as heat rising from sun-warmed stone.

In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended.

[328-332]
Dancing in space. Wind-carved clouds above plateauLongchenpa's words point beyond themselves to direct experience.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[333-337]
What is needed? Nothing. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThe nature described here is as effortless as perfume rising from unseen flowers.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity.

[338-342]
Snying po. Stream finding path through moraineJust as bird migrating without map needs no instruction to arise, this nature is self-existing.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[343-347]
In simple terms. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineRecognition dawns when seeking ceases, not through further effort.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure.

The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The unity appears. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksThis passage describes your own nature, though words can only gesture toward it.

The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[379-383]
Heart of the matter. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThe meaning here is found in the space between the words.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[404-408]
Forceful clarity. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe Dzogchen view is not a view to adopt but the nature (rang bzhin) to recognize.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform.

Sudden recognition! Like stone cairn marking mountain pass—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.
