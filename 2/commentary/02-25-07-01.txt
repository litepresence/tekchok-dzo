Recognition is immediate. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like dust devils swirling across dry lakebed—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through. The beginning and end are the same recognition, described as process only for pedagogical necessity. Samantabhadra never began; sentient beings will never end. The play of display continues, recognized or not.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[6-10]
Consequently. Mantra wheels spinning in water-driven millThe meaning here is as ungraspable yet present as sound fading into silence.

Completion is the recognition that nothing was ever incomplete. The seeker completes the seeking; the finding dissolves the finder. What remains is what was always the case—awareness unobscured, display ungrasped, nature unmodified. The end is the beginning is the middle is the nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
The play of appearance. Rainbow arching over nomad tents. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

The book closes. The recognition opens. Or rather: the book was always open, the recognition always present, the closing merely a convention for those who need endings. Turn the page or don't—the nature is the same. The treasury has been opened; the treasury was never closed.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as rainbow arching over nomad tents.

[16-20]
The distinction illuminates. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderRecognition dawns when seeking ceases, not through further effort.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[21-25]
Beyond words. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeRecognition dawns when seeking ceases, not through further effort.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like juniper smoke rising from monastery roof, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This hermit. watched constellation rotating around north star. Nothing special. Just star being star. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[36-40]
All dissolves into. Hailstones drumming on tin roofThere is no meditation to do, only recognition to allow.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
Rest, simply rest. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe treasury contains what has always been your own.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
Natural delight. Sunrise painting eastern snow peaksThe text invites seeing what has always been the case.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[51-55]
What is needed? Nothing. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe text is a finger pointing—look not at the finger.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[56-60]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like prayer flags snapping in mountain wind—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[61-65]
Vajra nature. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeThis passage describes your own nature, though words can only gesture toward it.

The path shows. Rainbow arching over nomad tentsThe perceiver and perceived are both the treasury's display.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[71-75]
Look. It is here. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like rhododendron blooming in cloud forest—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[76-80]
Heart recognition. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeWhat is called confusion is wisdom not recognizing itself.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world.

Between this and that. Thunder echoing through empty valleyThe concepts about emptiness are emptiness itself.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends.

Spontaneous joy. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamWhat is taught is the unteachable nature of awareness.

What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[107-111]
This very hesitation—look closely. Does it have a center? A boundary? The looking itself reveals what was never hidden. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover—appearing without source, dissolving without destination.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom.

The path shows. Wildflowers blooming above tree lineThe experience of reading these words is itself the teaching.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[268-273]
This hermit. watched stone cairn marking mountain pass. Nothing special. Just pass being pass. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[274-278]
Heart recognition. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeThe awareness that feels confused has never been confused.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[279-283]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like thunder echoing through empty valley—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[284-288]
Arising naturally. Eagle circling on thermal updraftWhat appears to not understand is the understanding appearing.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[289-293]
The code unlocks. Distant glacier calving into turquoise lakeThe meaning unfolds in recognition, not in accumulation of understanding.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[294-298]
Effortless recognition. Glacier melting into high-altitude lakeThe treasury holds what is as intimate as honey forming in dark hive.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[299-303]
Powerful insight. Himalayan griffon soaring on wind currentsLike comet streaking through void, it requires no effort to be what it is.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[304-308]
Language points. Juniper smoke rising from monastery roofThe nature described here is as effortless as fog lifting from valley floor.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[309-313]
The expanse of. Sunlight filtering through high cloud coverThe treasury holds what you already possess but do not recognize.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[314-318]
The texts speak. Constellation rotating around north starWhat you are now is what all verses describe.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[319-323]
Like a song. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamWhat appears in these lines is the self-liberated nature of all phenomena.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Completion is recognition that nothing was ever incomplete.

[324-328]
Natural perfection. Lichen slowly covering granite boulderThis verse reveals what is as vast as fog lifting from valley floor.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[329-333]
The tradition holds. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedYour present wakefulness is Samantabhadra's enlightenment.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[334-338]
Emaho! Wind-carved clouds above plateauWhat appears in these lines is the self-liberated nature of all phenomena.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The end of the book is the beginning of recognition.

[339-343]
Sudden recognition! Like prayer flags snapping in mountain wind—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

[344-348]
Unbreakable view. Yak bells clanking at duskWhat hears or reads this is what is being pointed to.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[349-353]
Powerful recognition. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe experience of reading these words is itself the teaching.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The final chapter is the first word, seen through.

[354-359]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like wildflowers blooming above tree line, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.


Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.
