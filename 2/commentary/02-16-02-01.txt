[1-5]
Rest in what is. Not later. Not elsewhere. Like hailstones drumming on tin roof—complete in itself, needing nothing added.

The ground is not a starting point but the ever-present basis that needs no beginning. To say 'primordial' is already too late—there was never a time when the ground was not. To seek the ground is to miss it; to rest without seeking is to find what was never lost.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Ground, path, and fruit are not sequential—they are three ways of describing one recognition.

[6-10]
Analysis proceeds. Rhododendron blooming in cloud forestThe experience of reading these words is itself the teaching.

The path appears only for the one who believes in distance. The ground and fruit are not endpoints of a journey—they are the same recognition viewed through delusion (ground), the clearing of delusion (path), and the recognition that delusion never existed (fruit). Three names, one nature.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11-15]
In the space of awareness. Marmot whistling across alpine meadow. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as marmot whistling across alpine meadow.

Fruit is not an achievement but the recognition that there was never anything to achieve. The Buddha-field is not a destination but the field of awareness when fixation drops. Sukhavati is not west but wherever recognition dawns—here, now, in this very thought.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[16-20]
The middle way opens. Eagle circling on thermal updraftThe text invites seeing what has always been the case.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The path doesn't lead to the fruit; the path IS the fruit seen from a distance.

[21-25]
Beyond words. Thunder echoing through empty valleyTrying to understand prevents the understanding that is always present.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like sunlight filtering through high cloud cover, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
This old fool. watched rainbow arching over nomad tents. Nothing special. Just tents being tents. Then—recognition. Not something new. Something remembered.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is called 'ground' is not a starting point but the ever-present basis.

[36-40]
Natural perfection. Constellation rotating around north starThis instant of experience is the only scripture needed.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[41-45]
Simple recognition. Wind-carved clouds above plateauThe awareness that understands is the awareness to be recognized.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[46-50]
The feminine principle. Full moon rising behind mountain ridgeWhat is sought has never been apart from the seeker.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Ground, path, and fruit are not sequential—they are three ways of describing one recognition.

[51-55]
Devoted attention. Dust devils swirling across dry lakebedYour present wakefulness is Samantabhadra's enlightenment.

Spontaneous joy. Snow leopard tracks crossing frozen streamThe treasury holds what you already possess but do not recognize.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Exactly so. Prayer flags snapping in mountain windWhat is taught is the unteachable nature of awareness.

Effortless recognition. Ice crystals forming on tent fabricThe meaning here is as luminous as sand dune shaped by nameless wind.

Sudden recognition! Like juniper smoke rising from monastery roof—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.
