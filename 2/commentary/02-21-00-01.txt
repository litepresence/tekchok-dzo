Liberation is not freedom from samsara but recognition that samsara was never bound. Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.

Self-liberation (rang grol) is not freedom achieved but bondage recognized as never having been. The prisoner discovers the cell door was always open, the chains always made of smoke, the sentence self-imposed. Liberation is not escape but the recognition there was never imprisonment.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Self-liberation is not liberation achieved but liberation recognized as never absent.

[6-10]
Delusion is not a mistake to correct but wisdom's play of hide-and-seek with itself. Rest in this understanding.

Samsara is rigpa playing hide-and-seek with itself, pretending to be bound, pretending to seek freedom, pretending to find what was never lost. The game is not bad—it's glorious! But the recognition that ends the game is even more glorious. Finding is the celebration; hiding was the setup.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. As natural as breathing.

[11-15]
The visionary sees. Thunder echoing through empty valley. The visionary sees what others miss—not through effort, but through recognition.

What binds is the belief in a binder. When the binder is recognized as empty, what remains to bind? The belief in binding is like a dream of chains—vivid, terrifying, completely unreal. Waking is not escaping the dream but recognizing you were never asleep.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The play of appearance and emptiness, inseparable as thunder echoing through empty valley.

[16-20]
Non-recognition requires the awareness it conceals—like darkness needing light to be seen. Rest in this understanding.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. As effortless as water being wet.

What binds is the belief in binding; what liberates is seeing belief is empty.

[21-25]
Self-liberation means liberation is not an act but the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Rest in this understanding.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. Like waking from sleep.

[26-30]
Between the conceptual understanding and direct recognition, we find the treasury's heart. Like constellation rotating around north star, the teaching appears and self-liberates. Not rejecting the words. Not grasping the meaning. Resting in the space between.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[31-35]
Liberation is not freedom from samsara but recognition that samsara was never bound. Rest in this understanding.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Like finding you were never lost.

Samsara is rigpa playing hide-and-seek with itself. Finding is the end of the game.

[36-40]
Delusion is not a mistake to correct but wisdom's play of hide-and-seek with itself. This is the treasury's heart.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. effortless, like water being wet.

[41-45]
Rigpa is not something to find but the finder itself, never lost. As when realizing you were never asleep.nition requires the awareness it conceals—like darkness needing light to be seen. As natural as breathing.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[51-55]
Self-liberation means liberation is not an act but the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Like finding you were never lost.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Self-liberation is not liberation achieved but liberation recognized as never absent.

[56-60]
The expanse is not a container but the uncontained nature of container and contained. This is the treasury's heart.

Sudden recognition! Like dust devils swirling across dry lakebed—appearing without warning, complete without preparation. The heruka laughs at our efforts to prepare for what is already present.
