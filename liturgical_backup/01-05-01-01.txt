[4172] <tantra> The Tantra of indicating words is two:
[4173] <tantra> The Tantra of meaning:
[4174] <prose> Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] <tantra> Always abiding in all, is thus called Tantra,
[4176] <tantra> Being the lineage of the Buddha, thus from Tantra,
[4177] <tantra> Holding the characteristic of the Buddha, thus placed in Tantra.
[4178] <tantra> The Tantra of words:
[4179] <prose> That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, and so forth—divided,
[4180] <prose> Is the chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] <prose> The chief discerning of the completion sequence, || 10 ||
[4182] <prose> Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] <prose> Showing beyond all: the key points of the Great Perfection.
[4184] <prose> The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
[4185] <list> First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,

[4199] <prose> The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] <prose> Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] <prose> Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two, || 30 ||
[4202] <prose> Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] <prose> Fruition and five complete.
[4204] <prose> Examples: like the warp,
[4205] <prose> Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] <prose> Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] <tantra> Valid: Tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] <tantra> Valid as Tantra.
[4209] <tantra> That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in Tantra.
[4210] <prose> Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
[4211] <tantra> The meaning Tantra and word Tantra are extensively explained. || 40 ||
[4212] <ornament> First: two,

[4217] <tantra> Divided: indicated method Tantra,

[4220] <prose> Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment.

[4224] <prose> Emptiness,
[4225] <prose> Clarity, two.

[4232] <prose> That too, awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings,
[4233] <tantra> Called indicated method Tantra.
[4234] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[4235] <tantra> All buddhas' method tantra,
[4236] <tantra> From the distinction of one basis nature,
[4237] <tantra> Indicated and indicating,
[4238] <tantra> Indicated tantra, one, all-pervading,
[4239] <tantra> All that connected to its trace,
[4240] <tantra> Pervading aspects two:
[4241] <tantra> Pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity, || 70 ||
[4242] <tantra> One cause of emptiness, without thing,
[4243] <tantra> Beyond all things' dharma,
[4244] <tantra> Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading,
[4245] <break> <tantra> Becoming the basis of all, one nature,
[4246] <break> <tantra> Pervading lord itself gathered,
[4247] <tantra> Birthless, memory exhausted,
[4248] <tantra> From the distinction of nature itself,
[4249] <tantra> Empty and appearing, appearing and empty,
[4250] <tantra> Things, without things, also are,
[4251] <tantra> Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness, || 80 ||
[4252] <tantra> Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object,
[4253] <tantra> Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature,
[4254] <tantra> Without stain, unmixed, perfect,
[4255] <tantra> Thoughtless, empty nature,

[4268] <tantra> Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect,
[4269] <tantra> Body clear pervading, thus called tantra.
[4270] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[4271] <tantra> Second, indicating method Tantra: three. || 100 ||

[4278] <tantra> Instruction tantras: words clear, easy,
[4279] <tantra> Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
