[18610] <tantra> From the Thalgyur Tantra:
[18611] <prose> Furthermore, the wisdom of appearance is taught.
[18612] <verse> From earth, water, fire, wind, and space,
[18613] <prose> Wisdom-appearance wondrously arises.
[18614] <prose> Thus the Bhagavan, unexcelled Lord, transcends contact.
[18615] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18616] <verse> From within emptiness itself,
[18617] <prose> Wisdom sought by analysis is not found.
[18618] <tantra> From severing the concepts of the three realms,
[18619] <prose> The five doors' fixation-stream is cut. || 10 ||
[18620] <verse> Moon and jewel, lapis lazuli light—
[18621] <prose> Whatever one desires to emanate,
[18622] <prose> Seize the appearance of the emanation body arisen from grasping.
[18623] <prose> Or else, from knowing the essential point
[18624] <prose> Of great perfection, wisdom itself
[18625] <prose> Free from activity, like space,
[18626] <prose> Transcends conceptual elaboration and reference.
[18627] <prose> Wondrous, marvelous wisdom—
[18628] <prose> Not before, not after, not primordially existent.
[18629] <prose> Now transcending the objects of conceptual mind, || 20 ||
[18630] <prose> The nature free from extremes, emptiness itself.
[18631] <prose> Beyond words, free from intellect, empty of essence.
[18632] <prose> Since nature is not divided anywhere,
[18633] <prose> Compassionate activity does not appear.
[18634] <verse> From the threefold wisdom-appearance,
[18635] <prose> Mind-arising, insight, and delusion-appearances are held.
[18636] <prose> This has no object of observation, no extreme.
[18637] <tantra> From the marvelous play of neither existence nor non-existence,
[18638] <prose> Buddhas attain the result.
[18639] <prose> Externally and internally, all is dharmadhatu. || 30 ||
[18640] <prose> Here nothing whatsoever appears.
[18641] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18642] <prose> Third, the wisdom of objects: when form and the other five objects are self-liberated,
[18643] <prose> The nature of the four appearances progressively increases.
[18644] <prose> Again, from that very source:
[18645] <tantra> Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught.
[18646] <verse> From the varieties of form and sound,
[18647] <prose> The experiences to be trained become fivefold.
[18648] <prose> The experience of consciousness exhausted is appearance,
[18649] <prose> Waxing like the moon's bright fortnight. || 40 ||
[18650] <prose> Each appearance has its own experience.
[18651] <tantra> Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught.
[18652] <break> <verse> From warmth, measure, and signs,
[18653] <break> <prose> The two truths inseparably joined, concept-extremes exhausted.
[18654] <prose> Without action, characteristics are empty.
[18655] <prose> Since the basis of expression ceases, extremes do not dwell.
[18656] <prose> Since outflows are exhausted, there is no clinging.
[18657] <prose> The source of memory cut, essence clear.
[18658] <break> <prose> Clear awareness does not conceive objects' extremes.
[18659] <break> <prose> Since it is free from sound, genuine, without words, || 50 ||
[18660] <prose> All reference points are exhausted.
[18661] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18662] <prose> The fourth topic has two aspects regarding individual meanings:
[18663] <prose> Brief presentation and
[18664] <prose> Detailed explanation.
[18665] <prose> Consequently, first, the Sugata-essence, the naturally spontaneously present Buddha of the nature of reality, great wisdom of meaning, pervades all sentient beings without addition or subtraction, great or small, good or bad.
[18666] <tantra> From the common scripture, the Tathagatagarbha Sutra:
[18667] <verse> "Within the bodies of all sentient beings, the Tathagatagarbha dwells as it was primordially."
[18668] <tantra> From the Uttaratantra:
[18669] <verse> Since the Buddha-body radiates, || 60 ||
[18670] <prose> Since suchness is without division,
[18671] <prose> Since the potential exists,
[18672] <prose> All embodied beings always possess the Buddha-essence.
[18673] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18674] <tantra> From the uncommon scripture, the Tregchö:
[18675] <verse> Sentient beings themselves are Buddhas.
[18676] <prose> However, they are obscured by adventitious defilements.
[18677] <prose> And from the Doha:
[18678] <verse> Through explaining treatises, all scholars
[18679] <prose> Do not realize Buddha exists within. || 70 ||
[18680] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18681] <tantra> From the unsurpassed scripture,
[18682] <tantra> The Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror Tantra, the Secret One:
[18683] <verse> "Within all sentient beings of the world-systems,
[18684] <prose> The Tathagatagarbha dwells like sesame pervaded by oil."
[18685] <prose> If one thinks that since it dwells thus, it should be visible to direct sight,
[18686] <prose> The body's appearance together with light is obscured by clinging, not found in the field of vision.
[18687] <prose> Yet now, like the sun example, dwelling within the body's cloud-mass,
[18688] <prose> When pointed out directly through the meaning,
[18689] <prose> The sign of the bindu, the lamp of emptiness, is shown—faith arises. || 80 ||
[18690] <prose> The speech is obscured by words;
[18691] <prose> The mind is obscured by conceptual mind, thus not seen.
[18692] <prose> The person of diligence who meditates on the four appearances as the measure, exists as it is now,
[18693] <prose> In the bardo, self-appearance pure, as it exists, will dawn.
[18694] <prose> Now it is like a garuda egg wrapped around—obscured by the growth of habitual patterns.
[18695] <tantra> From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Tantra:
[18696] <verse> Within the self-body of all sentient beings,
[18697] <prose> The appearance of pure wisdom dwells.
[18698] <prose> Unable to manifest vastly,
[18699] <prose> Like the womb and the egg's shell— || 90 ||
[18700] <prose> Not emerging directly, though obscured,
[18701] <prose> When own-potency is perfected, it emerges.
[18702] <prose> When this conceptual body is abandoned,
[18703] <break> <prose> Self-appearance and objects will meet.
[18704] <break> <prose> Awareness itself, dwelling primordially,
[18705] <prose> Will be seen as essence without concept.
[18706] <prose> The appearance of pure wisdom
[18707] <prose> And Buddha-truth will be seen.
[18708] <prose> The essence of self-appearance, wisdom itself,
[18709] <prose> Is without conceptual mind. || 100 ||
[18710] <prose> Past objects and future objects—
[18711] <prose> Appearance is cut through directly.
[18712] <prose> The self-appearance of great wisdom,
[18713] <prose> Though not an immediate object,
[18714] <prose> Is shown by the self-arisen lamp.
[18715] <prose> That very lamp's wisdom
[18716] <prose> Transcends the extremes of appearance and non-appearance.
[18717] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18718] <prose> Furthermore, that great wisdom dwells in the heart-center, the pure light-channel, the celestial palace, as essence-body, with the complete marks and signs of the five lights.
[18719] <prose> Since its nature dwells as light, wisdom's appearance is measureless. || 110 ||
[18720] <prose> Since compassion and awareness dwell, knowledge is internally clear.
[18721] <tantra> From that, resonating in the conch-shell chamber, the completely perfect great mandala of wrathful ones abides.
[18722] <prose> Light,
[18723] <prose> Rays,
[18724] <prose> Bindus,
[18725] <prose> Furthermore, and subtle bindus—the resonance of appearance's nature, like the four great channels branching from the heart's light-channel, dwells naturally,
[18726] <prose> And in the eyes dwells as four lamps.
[18727] <prose> That too: in the citta is the body;
[18728] <prose> In the four channels, bindus;
[18729] <prose> In the conch-chamber, light-rays; || 120 ||
[18730] <prose> In the eyes, Briguta—the appearance of Vajra Lougyu dwells.
[18731] <tantra> From Senge Tsal Dzogchen:
[18732] <verse> Ema! The wisdom of awareness itself
[18733] <prose> Dwells unchangingly within all Buddhas and sentient beings.
[18734] <prose> That nature of reality is as follows:
[18735] <prose> The citta, the jewel-celestial palace;
[18736] <prose> The jewel-channel's celestial palace;
[18737] <prose> The pure conch-chamber celestial palace;
[18738] <prose> The Briguta celestial palace;
[18739] <prose> Within these great celestial palaces, || 130 ||
[18740] <prose> The essence of awareness appears as potency.
[18741] <prose> That too is explained as follows:
[18742] <verse> Some dwell as bodies;
[18743] <prose> Some are bindus;
[18744] <prose> One dwells as light-ray manner;
[18745] <tantra> From one, Lougyu emerges.
[18746] <prose> Thus the dwelling-place is taught.
[18747] <prose> The meaning of Buddha primordially dwelling,
[18748] <prose> Dwelling within all sentient beings,
[18749] <prose> The Victorious Ones excellently explained. || 140 ||
[18750] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18751] <prose> Furthermore, body and Lougyu,
[18752] <prose> Dhatu and wisdom's meaning:
[18753] <tantra> From that very source:
[18754] <verse> Awareness and non-awareness, appearance itself,
[18755] <prose> Transcends the extremes of actor and action.
[18756] <prose> Vastness itself radiates like a body;
[18757] <prose> Clarity itself arises like light;
[18758] <prose> Emptiness itself spreads like rays.
[18759] <prose> Buddha and sentient being— || 150 ||
[18760] <prose> Not separate awareness,
[18761] <prose> But taught as separate appearances.
[18762] <verse> The characteristics of the body are as follows:
[18763] <prose> Unchanging, clear,
[18764] <prose> Empty, and free from concept.
[18765] <prose> The characteristics of awareness are as follows:
[18766] <prose> Subtle, radiating,
[18767] <prose> Lougyu, and moving.
[18768] <prose> The characteristics of dhatu are as follows:
[18769] <prose> Vast, spontaneously thick, emptiness without limit, || 160 ||
[18770] <prose> Clear, warm, and cool,
[18771] <prose> Holding light-flexible essence,
[18772] <prose> Pervading, encircling, and encompassing.
[18773] <verse> The characteristics of wisdom are as follows:
[18774] <prose> Arising, entering, self-clear,
[18775] <prose> Primordial, knowing, realized.
[18776] <prose> Clear, radiant, and infinitely vast,
[18777] <prose> Appearance, darkness, and revealing,
[18778] <prose> Emptiness and clear wisdom supreme—
[18779] <prose> These are held as mantra characteristics. || 170 ||
[18780] <break> <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18781] <break> <prose> That too: in the heart is the body;
[18782] <prose> In the conch-mouth, wisdom;
[18783] <prose> In Briguta, awareness;
[18784] <prose> In the four channels, the appearance of dharmadhatu light and bindus dawn.
[18785] <prose> The four channels, from self-arising:
[18786] <verse> The pure white, smooth, empty channel;
[18787] <prose> The channels of jewel-radiance;
[18788] <prose> The great liberating channel;
[18789] <prose> The white crystal moving channel— || 180 ||
[18790] <tantra> From these, consciousness mounted on wind
[18791] <prose> Enters through Briguta's great door,
[18792] <prose> Dissolving into the arising-path emptiness.
[18793] <prose> Without what dissolves, clarity like a vase,
[18794] <prose> The five-fold bindu, wisdom perfected.
[18795] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18796] <prose> That wisdom, self-abiding in the heart's great channel, clear resonance, abiding in its own light, wisdom's self-resonance,
[18797] <prose> Is supported by the four channels' five wisdoms' self-resonance, maturing into the four lamps within cakṣu as the wisdom bindu, the lamp of emptiness, and the lamp of pure dharmadhatu,
[18798] <prose> And as measureless wisdom, the lasso-water lamp and self-arisen wisdom lamp, from the Thalgyur:
[18799] <tantra> Within the time of the body, as follows: || 190 ||
[18800] <verse> In the assembled elements, the aggregates,
[18801] <prose> Within the citta, the jewel-celestial palace,
[18802] <prose> The essence, pure from the letter KA,
[18803] <prose> Emptiness-clarity gathered, body's resonance,
[18804] <prose> Complete face and hands, vase-body manner,
[18805] <prose> Spontaneously present as light-mass,
[18806] <prose> Compassion individually clear in colors.
[18807] <prose> Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma,
[18808] <prose> Katishel, having the tube—
[18809] <prose> Mirror-like, equality, discriminating, || 200 ||
[18810] <prose> All-accomplishing, dharmadhatu wisdom:
[18811] <prose> Bindus moving and non-moving,
[18812] <prose> Abiding as supports of perfected own-potency.
[18813] <tantra> From the gathered pure essence of both eyes,
[18814] <prose> Through method and wisdom's distinction,
[18815] <prose> The bindu of knowing the nature of reality,
[18816] <prose> And the lamp of pure dharmadhatu mature.
[18817] <prose> Measureless, the lasso and
[18818] <prose> Wisdom lamp mature,
[18819] <prose> Thus the karma of sentient beings, || 210 ||
[18820] <prose> And faculties' distinctions as they are,
[18821] <prose> Through training in these, one will know.
[18822] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18823] <prose> Second, detailed explanation has two aspects:
[18824] <prose> General indication of the object of knowledge,
[18825] <prose> And detailed explanation of the object to be adopted.
[18826] <prose> First, from eight aspects:
[18827] <prose> The support is the form aggregate, the upper body.
[18828] <prose> The location is the heart jewel, eight-cornered, center of the pure light-channel, where the peaceful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells with awareness.
[18829] <prose> The path proceeds from the four channels. || 220 ||
[18830] <prose> The door is the two eyes.
[18831] <prose> The resonance is two lamps—like a peacock's and like the syllable HA.
[18832] <prose> The object is space free from clouds, dharmatā emptiness without thought or conceptualization.
[18833] <prose> The time is this very moment or when bardo appearance dawns.
[18834] <prose> The destination is the eight dawning-doors of spontaneous presence: those who recognize go to liberation in the dhatu; those who don't recognize wander in saṃsāra—like the four path-forks.
[18835] <prose> The liberation-place is the appearance of original purity.
[18836] <prose> Thus also from Rangshar:
[18837] <tantra> Kye, companions, listen!
[18838] <prose> The suchness of all dharmas should be indicated by examples.
[18839] <break> <prose> The intent of the perfectly complete Buddha is: || 230 ||
[18840] <break> <prose> The support relies on the form aggregate.
[18841] <prose> Example: like sleeping in a bird's nest.
[18842] <prose> The location dwells in the heart—example: like a vase-body.
[18843] <prose> The path emerges from the four channels—example: like a pearl rosary strung.
[18844] <prose> It coils within the white conch-chamber—example: like a lamp placed inside a vase.
[18845] <prose> The door emerges from the eyes—example: like star-light.
[18846] <prose> The lamp of empty bindu—example: like a peacock's eye.
[18847] <prose> The lamp of dhatu-awareness—example: like the syllable NA RO.
[18848] <prose> The object is empty space.
[18849] <prose> The time is bardo appearance—example: like a mirror mandala. || 240 ||
[18850] <prose> The destination is the jewel body—example: like a rock-path.
[18851] <prose> The liberation-place is the appearance of original purity—example: like a vase-body.
[18852] <prose> And from Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror:
[18853] <tantra> Aho! Listen, great expanse-children!
[18854] <prose> Within all sentient beings of the world-systems,
[18855] <break> <prose> The Tathagatagarbha dwells like sesame seeds pervaded by oil.
[18856] <break> <prose> That too: the support relies on the form aggregate.
[18857] <prose> The location dwells in the heart-center: Samantabhadra, called "cuckoo beak-sealed intention," dwells within like a cuckoo's sealed beak. Within, in the five-colored light center, the peaceful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells in the manner of light-mansion.
[18858] <prose> That is the location of awareness.
[18859] <prose> Example: like a vase-body. || 250 ||
[18860] <prose> The wisdom arising from that dwells in the head, the conch-chamber.
[18861] <prose> That too, the wrathful body, sesame-seed sized, dwells at the distance of drawn bow-string.
[18862] <prose> That too dwells as light-ray manner.
[18863] <break> <prose> The light arising from that is clear like a mirror mandala, pure, or dwells as light-rays like a fish-eye.
[18864] <break> <prose> The connection of that with awareness is: from the heart's tip, the white silk-thread channel upward, mere as a silk-leaf, passing through the throat, exists there. From there the path emerges and enters inside the head.
[18865] <prose> Furthermore, that channel too, from the small tip, right and left, emerges and connects to the head.
[18866] <break> <prose> That too emerges from the right and left ear-flaps and connects to the eyes.
[18867] <break> <tantra> From there, turning the eyes to space, twisting the channel, looking, wisdom's light-appearance will fill space.
[18868] <prose> That too: from the heart-center's light-channel, the golden great channel Katishel branches, the upward tip white silk-leaf channel, from the heart-tip passing through the throat, from the ear branches three to the two eyes' door, pierces.
[18869] <prose> The central one pierces Brahma's aperture. || 260 ||
[18870] <break> <prose> Therefore, in the subtle, the coils are the centers of the four chakras, each connected from the heart.
[18871] <prose> The crystal-apertured one dwells with the resonance of the five clear-light winds at the life-force channel.
[18872] <break> <prose> Second, detailed explanation of the wisdom object to be adopted has three aspects:
[18873] <prose> The support, channels, to be purified;
[18874] <prose> The doors of arising, the lamps to be held;
[18875] <prose> The resonance of appearance, clear light to be shown.
[18876] <prose> First, since wisdom dwells in the body, introducing it to the path through two essential points:
[18877] <prose> The general essential point: directing wind-mind to the lamp AH, exhausting dharmadhatu-awareness' increase-decrease, from the Thalgyur:
[18878] <verse> Self-knowing wisdom dwells in the body,
[18879] <prose> Like oil within sesame seeds. || 270 ||
[18880] <prose> The body's radiance and splendor
[18881] <prose> Wisdom moistens, pervading.
[18882] <prose> Through corresponding with body, the bodies,
[18883] <prose> Wisdom's light-aura, colors, and signs.
[18884] <prose> Through karma, entering, and bodies,
[18885] <prose> Resonance and all pervading.
[18886] <prose> Insight itself and the lamp's function—
[18887] <prose> Ultimate and relative signs distinguished.
[18888] <prose> Maturing: each bindu's essential point;
[18889] <prose> Transforming: concept, coarse grasping. || 280 ||
[18890] <prose> Wisdom-appearance, four, two aspects,
[18891] <tantra> From arising-entering's distinction.
[18892] <prose> In the citta, jewel-celestial palace,
[18893] <prose> Jewel-gathered, eight-cornered, doored,
[18894] <prose> Five wisdoms and five bodies,
[18895] <prose> Wind and knowledge's potency also five.
[18896] <prose> All are five-five's nature.
[18897] <prose> The body's essential point is through resonance.
[18898] <prose> Wisdom's posture through purity.
[18899] <prose> Lifting and stirring bindus accomplishes. || 290 ||
[18900] <prose> Light extending and gathering.
[18901] <prose> Connected meditation is wind's essential point.
[18902] <prose> The entering function distinguishes extremes.
[18903] <prose> Its transforming causes wind exhaustion.
[18904] <prose> Delusion's concordance to be joined.
[18905] <prose> Awareness' essential point is releasing,
[18906] <prose> Lifting and directing to space.
[18907] <prose> Dhatu's essential point is gathering,
[18908] <prose> Drawing and pervading elements.
[18909] <prose> Appearance's essential point: increase and exhaustion, || 300 ||
[18910] <prose> Various, self-liberated in their own place.
[18911] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18912] <prose> The specific essential point: pressing the essential points of four chakras and three main channels, introducing wind-mind into wisdom's network, from that very source:
[18913] <verse> Awareness-wisdom's path itself,
[18914] <prose> Within one's own channel-chakra,
[18915] <prose> Where body-speech self-perfectly dwells,
[18916] <prose> Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma,
[18917] <prose> The three mothers hold the body,
[18918] <prose> The central supports four chakras.
[18919] <prose> These dwelling right, left, center, || 310 ||
[18920] <prose> Through relative-ultimate distinction,
[18921] <prose> Generate body and limbs,
[18922] <prose> And mature the lamp itself.
[18923] <prose> Roma circulates tastes in the chakra,
[18924] <prose> Wind urges, bindus emanate.
[18925] <prose> Since taste relies on channels,
[18926] <prose> Bliss expands body and mind.
[18927] <prose> MA gathers the pure essence,
[18928] <prose> Establishes base of upper-lower locations.
[18929] <prose> Lifting and pressing in this is essential. || 320 ||
[18930] <prose> In this's six branches,
[18931] <break> <prose> Burning and incinerating, wisdom ceases.
[18932] <break> <prose> If desiring warmth-attainment, pressing is essential.
[18933] <prose> Wind and bindu should be drawn.
[18934] <prose> Kyangma generates in the chakra,
[18935] <break> <prose> Wind emanates, gathers, bindus enter.
[18936] <break> <verse> "Kyang" means peerless,
[18937] <prose> Revealing unique intention.
[18938] <prose> MA clears the old,
[18939] <prose> Generates essence-splendor. || 330 ||
[18940] <prose> In this, opening and pressing is essential.
[18941] <prose> In this, the branch not appearing,
[18942] <prose> Place bindus in the four corners.
[18943] <prose> Desiring food-control,
[18944] <prose> Press wind, don't expel water.
[18945] <break> <prose> Through samaya, examine channels.
[18946] <break> <prose> Kundarma is mindfulness,
[18947] <prose> Gathering the tip-chakra matures.
[18948] <prose> Reversing karma-wind, holds wisdom.
[18949] <verse> "Kun" gives emanation body qualities. || 340 ||
[18950] <prose> Shaking is enjoyment body qualities.
[18951] <prose> MA actually shows Dharmakāya.
[18952] <prose> In this's twelve branches,
[18953] <prose> Opening and twisting is essential.
[18954] <prose> Extending life, rely on applying.
[18955] <prose> Bindus, through body and mind.
[18956] <tantra> From this wisdom-path,
[18957] <prose> Bindus and body are obtained.
[18958] <prose> Wind performs all going-coming actions.
[18959] <prose> Mind's lord held by mentation. || 350 ||
[18960] <prose> Path-held and drawn.
[18961] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18962] <prose> Second, holding the doors of arising, the lamps, has two aspects: door and lamp.
[18963] <prose> The door's essential point: the channel connecting heart to head, the faults and qualities of the sense-faculties' clarifier, has five branches in the eye. From the center of the deer-horn-like channel's coils, from the light-channel, wisdom actually emerges. Looking unwaveringly into space's expanse is the true essential point, from the Thalgyur:
[18964] <verse> The door of wisdom's arising itself,
[18965] <prose> All body-essence, pure gathering,
[18966] <prose> Emerging from the door called cakṣu,
[18967] <prose> Holding both aspects, showing appearance.
[18968] <prose> Arising from connected generating channels.
[18969] <tantra> From the tip becoming one, || 360 ||
[18970] <prose> Dawning for faculties' objects,
[18971] <prose> In one having five branches,
[18972] <prose> Appearing in each faculty's door.
[18973] <prose> Particularly distinguishing faults and qualities,
[18974] <tantra> From deer-horn-like coils,
[18975] <verse> "A-bré" called, half white-black,
[18976] <prose> Knowing and holding forms,
[18977] <prose> Perfectly showing knowledge's own-potency.
[18978] <prose> In this, wisdom actually emerges,
[18979] <prose> Directly and through self-essential point, || 370 ||
[18980] <prose> The pure dharmatā self-appearance object,
[18981] <prose> Abiding with concept ceasing.
[18982] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[18983] <prose> The lamp's essential point: through gaze-binding and gazing-binding, pressing, directing, leading, and training in sun-moon support, from that very source:
[18984] <verse> From ultimate dharmatā arising,
[18985] <prose> Lamps are of four types:
[18986] <prose> Maturing, entering, pervading-emptiness,
[18987] <prose> Gathering dharmatā's object-appearance.
[18988] <tantra> From the lasso, forms are gathered,
[18989] <prose> Wind cuts and emanates. || 380 ||
[18990] <prose> Through coming-going's increase-decrease,
[18991] <prose> Pure wisdom is gathered.
[18992] <prose> The empty bindu performs all actions.
[18993] <prose> Holding the past path's aspect,
[18994] <prose> Wind generates radiance and splendor.
[18995] <prose> Transforming, showing wisdom-appearance.
[18996] <prose> Through self-arisen wisdom lamp,
[18997] <prose> All dharmas equally, one taste,
[18998] <prose> Gathered, holding self-appearance.
[18999] <prose> This cuts habitual pattern connections. || 390 ||
[19000] <prose> Dhatu gathers pure essence,
[19001] <prose> Awareness holds the bodies,
[19002] <prose> Through three essential points maturing essence,
[19003] <prose> saṃsāra is abandoned.
[19004] <prose> Thus from the eye, lamp arising,
[19005] <prose> Buddha-intention's essential points gathered,
[19006] <prose> Holding self-appearance objects.
[19007] <prose> The lamp's essential point I explain—
[19008] <prose> Deva-son of good fortune, you listen!
[19009] <break> <prose> Through objects, awareness, and wind, || 400 ||
[19010] <break> <prose> In order to hold dharmatā as path,
[19011] <prose> Through perfected wisdom,
[19012] <break> <prose> This too is the lamp's essential point.
[19013] <break> <prose> Lasso unmoving is essential.
[19014] <prose> At this time, join with three gazes.
[19015] <prose> Wisdom lamp training's essential point—
[19016] <prose> Three rituals extending,
[19017] <prose> Through accomplishing essential point, generate expanse.
[19018] <prose> Bindu-lamp pressing is essential.
[19019] <prose> Through not separating channel and thumb-finger, || 410 ||
[19020] <prose> Wisdom increases upward.
[19021] <prose> Dhatu's essential point is leading.
[19022] <prose> Yogins, properly join sun-training methods,
[19023] <prose> Lead well.
[19024] <prose> Train also in moon.
[19025] <prose> Whoever does this continuously,
[19026] <prose> Delusion-appearance-stream ceases.
[19027] <prose> Five pure wisdoms' light,
[19028] <prose> Through emptying earth, stone, rock-mountain,
[19029] <prose> Ship-broken or mere land-island— || 420 ||
[19030] <prose> Those skilled in leading will see.
[19031] <prose> At this time, method-adjustment is essential.
[19032] <prose> Through perfection, dharmatā is obtained.
[19033] <prose> Thus through habituation, dharmatā's power,
[19034] <prose> Body-arising self-perfects in its own place.
[19035] <prose> Thus through body-arising stream-ceasing,
[19036] <prose> Outflow-aggregates become invisible,
[19037] <prose> In this, perfect buddhahood.
[19038] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[19039] <prose> Third, showing the resonance of appearance, clear light, has five aspects: || 430 ||
[19040] <prose> Body,
[19041] <prose> Wisdom,
[19042] <prose> Light,
[19043] <prose> Bindu,
[19044] <prose> And detailed explanation of awareness' nature.
[19045] <prose> First has two aspects: brief presentation and detailed explanation.
[19046] <prose> First, from the Thalgyur:
[19047] <verse> Within the citta, body dwells as body.
[19048] <prose> Resonance-body through five aspects
[19049] <prose> Holds each family's characteristics. || 440 ||
[19050] <prose> Ray-body through six also
[19051] <prose> Gathers nature-appearance's dharmatā.
[19052] <prose> Pure body through three
[19053] <prose> Holds nirvāṇa's indication.
[19054] <prose> Aspect-body through eight also
[19055] <prose> Performs complete stage-path actions.
[19056] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[19057] <prose> Since citta's essence dwells as body's arising-base, when that resonance, the five families' bodies unmixed, measure dawns, appearance dawns.
[19058] <tantra> From the body, rays emanate; within channels, bindus ray-resonance, external expansion, and appearance's subtle body, six aspects appear.
[19059] <prose> The wisdom three liberated, body's liberation-place, holding the measure of internal dhatu exhaustion. || 450 ||
[19060] <prose> Moreover, the eight aspect-bodies are at the completion-stage, spontaneously present ground, from dividing three bodies into nine;
[19061] <prose> Dharmakāya's Dharmakāya, pure dharmadhatu, all's arising-base, established as base, not counted separately, thus eight.
[19062] <prose> Second, detailed explanation of body has two aspects:
[19063] <prose> Common distinctions and
[19064] <prose> Distinct distinctions, detailed explanation.
[19065] <prose> First has two aspects:
[19066] <prose> Awareness object-appearance's body and
[19067] <prose> Pure essence gathered body, from Sun-Moon Seal:
[19068] <tantra> Body is twofold: awareness object-appearance's body
[19069] <prose> And pure essences gathered body. || 460 ||
[19070] <prose> First, appearing to faculties, without negation or proof;
[19071] <prose> Distinguishing: faculties,
[19072] <prose> Aggregates,
[19073] <prose> Objects and subjects, pure body, and three, from that very source:
[19074] <tantra> The body appearing to awareness-objects is the great body of faculties purified,
[19075] <prose> The great body of aggregates purified,
[19076] <prose> The great body of dhātus and āyatanas, objects and subjects, and afflictions purified.
[19077] <prose> Second, the pure essence gathered body appears to those habituated into power:
[19078] <prose> Distinguishing: the body holding the unmistaken path's own-characteristics,
[19079] <prose> And the body unchanging in color-light characteristics, as-it-is, from these two, first: || 470 ||
[19080] <verse> Through essence, nature, compassion three,
[19081] <prose> Holding path's characteristics,
[19082] <prose> Causing result to reach measure,
[19083] <prose> Great Play body and
[19084] <prose> Great General body and
[19085] <prose> Family-sustaining body are renowned.
[19086] <tantra> From Sun-Moon Seal:
[19087] <tantra> The body holding own-characteristics is as follows:
[19088] <prose> Non-dividing Great Play body,
[19089] <prose> Supreme Great General body, || 480 ||
[19090] <prose> And family-sustaining body.
[19091] <prose> Second, the as-it-is body has three aspects: base, path, and result.
[19092] <prose> The body dwelling in base self-arisen wisdom,
[19093] <prose> The body unchanging from external appearance of light-resonance dhatu-body primeval,
[19094] <prose> The three bodies spontaneously present dhatu-exhausted destination reached, from that very source:
[19095] <tantra> The as-it-is body is as follows:
[19096] <prose> Primordially abiding first body,
[19097] <prose> Primeval unchanging body,
[19098] <prose> And result self-perfecting body.
[19099] <prose> The result self-perfecting body is threefold: || 490 ||
[19100] <tantra> Dharmakāya without elaboration great,
[19101] <prose> Saṃbhogakaya without grasping great,
[19102] <prose> And Nirmāṇakaya without self great.
[19103] <prose> Second, distinct distinctions' detailed explanation has two aspects: essence brief presentation and
[19104] <prose> Detailed explanation.
[19105] <prose> First, from Rangshar:
[19106] <tantra> What is body? The base awareness body,
[19107] <prose> Vast dharmatā body,
[19108] <prose> Expanded dhatu body,
[19109] <prose> Unchanging essence body, || 500 ||
[19110] <prose> Pure bliss body,
[19111] <prose> Erroneous mind body,
[19112] <prose> Seeing self-liberated body,
[19113] <prose> One bindu body,
[19114] <prose> Unbroken space body,
[19115] <prose> Non-falling directions sun-moon body,
[19116] <prose> Non-dual other body,
[19117] <prose> And attachment-free self-liberated body.
[19118] <ornament> Second:
[19119] <prose> What are the characteristics of these thirteen bodies? Explained from that very source: || 510 ||
[19120] <tantra> That is as follows:
[19121] <prose> The base awareness body is Vajra Lougyu's body. It is clear to one's unceased eye-faculty.
[19122] <prose> That is called the base awareness body.
[19123] <prose> The vast dharmatā body is the original base, original purity great, from which there is no thought.
[19124] <prose> No non-awareness.

[19132] <prose> Extreme-free awareness,
[19133] <prose> Great pure appearance,

[19142] <prose> Internal five wisdom-lights unceasingly clear,
[19143] <prose> Abiding as body and wisdom's essence.
[19144] <prose> That is called the vast dharmatā body.
[19145] <prose> The expanded dhatu body is the pure dharmadhatu lamp.
[19146] <prose> That dhatu too is unbroken,
[19147] <prose> Non-fallen in directions,
[19148] <prose> Without decrease,
[19149] <prose> Without increase, || 540 ||
[19150] <prose> Without emptying,
[19151] <prose> Without filling,
[19152] <prose> With clear aspect,
[19153] <prose> The location where many bodies arise,
[19154] <prose> Vast, all's essence,
[19155] <prose> Extremely great, none above,
[19156] <prose> Buddha of view-seeing,
[19157] <prose> Called the ground of definite attainment.
[19158] <prose> That is called the expanded dhatu body.
[19159] <prose> The unchanging vajra body is: Buddha without Buddha result, || 550 ||

[19183] <prose> Nature all-pervading,
[19184] <prose> Compassion sky-pervading.

[19186] <prose> The pure bliss body is: clear not sky-pervading,
[19187] <prose> Empty all-pervading,
[19188] <prose> Wisdom eye-pervading,
[19189] <prose> Awareness body-pervading, || 580 ||
[19190] <prose> Lamp object-pervading,

[19194] <prose> Five lights location-pervading.
[19195] <prose> That is the pure bliss body.
[19196] <prose> The erroneous mind body is: variously arising,

[19200] <prose> All's base,
[19201] <prose> saṃsāra self-place.
[19202] <prose> That is the erroneous mind body.
[19203] <prose> The seeing self-liberated body is: unchanging yet changing,

[19224] <prose> That is the one bindu body.
[19225] <prose> The unbroken space body is: appearance and wisdom unbroken,
[19226] <prose> Space and dhatu unbroken,
[19227] <prose> Sentient beings and Buddhas unbroken,
[19228] <prose> Elements and light-appearance unbroken,
[19229] <prose> Seeing and self-body unbroken, || 620 ||

[19232] <prose> Pure lands and spontaneous presence unbroken,

[19236] <prose> Non-awareness and awareness unbroken,
[19237] <break> <prose> Non-awareness and awareness unbroken,
[19238] <break> <prose> Emptiness and clarity unbroken.
[19239] <prose> That is called the unbroken space body. || 630 ||
[19240] <prose> The non-fallen-directions sun-moon body is: grasping-free self-liberated, concept-free self-Buddha,
[19241] <prose> Unchanging self-pure,

[19278] <prose> That is called the attachment-free self-liberated body.
[19279] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 670 ||
[19280] <prose> If these were explained in detail, they are clear, measureless, therefore elaboration ceases.
[19281] <prose> Second, detailed explanation of wisdom's nature has two aspects:
[19282] <prose> Base-dwelling wisdom and
[19283] <prose> Characteristic-holding wisdom.
[19284] <prose> First, from essence, nature, compassion three:
[19285] <prose> Essence appears as body;
[19286] <prose> Nature appears as light;
[19287] <prose> Compassion's activity appears as enlightened activity.
[19288] <prose> Thus also from Sun-Moon Seal:
[19289] <tantra> Base-dwelling wisdom is threefold: essence original purity wisdom, || 680 ||
[19290] <prose> Nature spontaneously present wisdom,
[19291] <prose> And compassion self-appearance wisdom.
[19292] <prose> Second, the five characteristic-holding wisdoms:
[19293] <prose> Since dhatu exists in body, from its potency arises, from Rangshar:
[19294] <verse> From unchanging body, unceasing wisdom arises.
[19295] <prose> That is as follows:
[19296] <prose> Since dhatu exists in body,
[19297] <prose> Dharmadhatu wisdom arises.
[19298] <prose> Since clarity-aspect exists in dhatu,
[19299] <prose> Mirror-like wisdom arises. || 690 ||
[19300] <prose> Since non-duality exists in clarity,
[19301] <prose> Equality wisdom arises.
[19302] <prose> Since seeing exists in non-duality,
